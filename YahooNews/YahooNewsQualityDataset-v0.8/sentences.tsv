2	10-pages-lost-most-fans-facebooks-purge-153723567	As a result, Lady Gaga's page lost 65,505 fans from Tuesday through mid-Thursday, the third-highest drop in likes of any fan page, according to data provided to Mashable by FanPageList, which tracks numbers for official Facebook fan pages and Twitter accounts.

2	10-pages-lost-most-fans-facebooks-purge-153723567	FanPageList analyzed the top 500 pages on Facebook and found that seven of the ten pages that lost the most followers belonged to celebrities, including Rihanna, Shakira and Justin Bieber.	1	2	1

2	10-pages-lost-most-fans-facebooks-purge-153723567	When Facebook announced the decision to eliminate likes, it said brand pages would lose less than 1% of their total fans on average and sure enough, that appears to be the case.	3	4	1

3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Figuring out what to include on your résumé can be a real headache.	2	1	2		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Too much information, and you risk overwhelming the reader.	2	1	2		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Too little, and you might not stand out from the crowd.	2	1	2		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	The trick to striking the right balance is including the most effective information, especially things that might catch a hiring manager's eye.	3	1	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Here are 10 surprising items you might want to include on your résumé.	2	1	1		3

3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Conventional wisdom says don't talk about politics at work, but surprisingly, experts say including political stances on your résumé is a good way to see if you are a good fit for a company.	2	2	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	"Every job seeker wants to find common ground and a connection to the company or hiring manager," said Chris Westfall, a professional development coach and author of "The New Elevator Pitch" (Marie Street Press, 2012).	2	1	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	"What better way to make a connection than through the causes that you support?	3	2	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	If you support causes that are not encouraged by your employer, that's something you need to know before you accept the job!"	2	1	1		3

3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Don't worry that you'll overwhelm the person reading your résumé with too much detail.	2	2	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Details about your responsibilities at past jobs will help a hiring manager decide if you're a good fit.	2	3	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	"Hiring managers want specific, quantifiable examples of your past successes, not mere job descriptions of past positions you held," said Charles Purdy, senior editor and career-advice expert at Monster.com.	2	1	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	"Find a way to tell stories of how your past work improved a company's or organization's bottom line, and use those numbers."	2	1	1		3

3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	The last items you'd think belong on your résumé are the things you did wrong at your last job, but one expert says featuring your failures can actually help you get a job.	1	2	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	"One non-intuitive thing employers want to see on a résumé is failure," said Phil Rosenberg, president of reCareered.com.	2	2	2		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	"Employers want to see that you've tried, failed and learned from your failure, all on a prior employer's dime.	2	2	2		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	This demonstrates innovation, willingness to teach risks, [and] faster reaction and response time.	2	3	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	It is also a learning experience, and failure teaches success."	2	2	1		3

3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	"I love to see job seekers who have spent a decent amount of time abroad, [whether] for education, employment or volunteer work," said Rachel Dotson, content manager at ZipRecruiter.com.	1	3	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	"This type of experience suggests several important things about the candidate.	2	2	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	For example, they are not afraid to leave their comfort zone, they are aware and independent, and they have worked in unfamiliar situations with unfamiliar groups.	3	3	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	While there is no guarantee that these characteristics are true of every person who has gone abroad, the experience itself is certainly enough to pique my interest."	1	2	1		3

3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Even if you think that some of your past jobs are trivial, one expert says they may still help you get a job.	1	2	2		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Cody Teets, author of "Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers that Began at McDonald's" (Cider Mill Press, 2012) said employers know that working at a fast-food restaurant isn't easy, and it can help a job seeker’s resumé stand out.	2	2	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Teets, who is now vice president and general manager of McDonald's Rocky Mountain region, said employers value the things that workers learn at their early jobs.	1	2	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	At McDonald's, for example, workers learn to operate as part of a team, to challenge themselves and to roll with the punches, all skills that will come in handy at any job.	2	2	1		3

3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Lest you think using a QR code (Quick Response code, or matrix barcode) on your résumé will make you look a little too eager, one hiring expert said, it will actually have the opposite effect.	2	2	1		3

3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Even if potential employees are working on side projects unrelated to the full-time job they are seeking, it may be worthwhile to include those efforts on a résumé, one expert said.	1	1	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Any kind of side venture, side business or project that could be indirectly related to the full-time work you're pursuing is a good idea, said Dana Leavy-Detrick, small business consultant at Aspyre.	1	2	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	"This is a great way to show employers that you're using your own time to acquire and grow skills outside of the job that will help you develop and contribute in the long-run.	2	3	1		3

3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	"This is particularly true if the talent or drive is directly relevant to the job at hand, but it's also true for applicants who have competed at a high level in other areas.	2	1	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	High-performing companies are always looking for an edge in the marketplace, and having a team of competitive and passionate employees on board can provide a significant advantage."	2	3	1		3

3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	One option growing in popularity among many job seekers is a video résumé.	1	1	1		3	
3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	"Including a link to a video résumé is a great way to set yourself apart from the crowd and impress hiring managers," said Josh Tolan, CEO of onlinehiring-network, Spark Hire.	1	4	1		3

"Most often, those candidates know what it takes to function as part of a team, from pulling your own weight to jumping in to do what's necessary to win.				I	3

10	2-arrested-art-heist-calif-financiers-home-015621388	(AP) — Police say they've arrested two suspects and recovered all the paintings stolen in a huge heist from the home of a Southern California financier.	1	1	3	S	4

10	2-arrested-art-heist-calif-financiers-home-015621388	Richard Lewis said in a statement Thursday that most of the paintings were found when authorities served a search warrant on a car stereo store in Pasadena after a tip from local police.	2	1	1	S	4

11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	It's time once again for TV's A-list to squeeze into their tuxes and gowns, practice their strategically "spontaneous" thank-you speeches, and brave Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet.	3	2	2		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	On Sunday night, the 64th annual Emmy Awards will air on NBC, with TV's most acclaimed series vying for the glory — and the ratings bump — that comes with the graceful gold statuette.	3	3	2		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	Unsurprisingly, critics are already second-guessing the night's successes, surprises, and snubs.	3	2	2		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	Here, 5 predictions for the 64th annual Primetime Emmy Awards:	2	1	1		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	1. Whatever your predictions, it's going to be an uncharacteristically unpredictable nightWhen Survivor host Jeff Probst wasn't even nominated in the Best Reality Show Host category — an award he's won since the category was created in 2008 — it was a sign that "something new" was finally happening with Emmy voters, says Lisa de Moraes at the Washington Post.	3	2	2	S	4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	As a result, the Emmys are looking "particularly treacherous" to previous winners and prognosticators.	2	1	2		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	Previous shoo-ins like The Daily Show may be in for an unpleasant surprise on Sunday night.	2	1	2		4

11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	2. Mad Men's reign as Best Drama might be overAMC's Mad Men is gunning for a record-breaking fifth consecutive Best Drama Emmy, but critically-acclaimed British costume drama Downton Abbey — which aired earlier this year on PBS — could break the streak.	3	2	2	S	4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	Historically, says Jill Serjeant at Reuters, "British imports often do well at U.S. awards shows."	2	2	1		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	Another potential bad omen for Mad Men?	3	1	2		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	It "emerged empty-handed from last weekend's Creative Arts portion of the Emmys," which honors achievement in costuming and hairstyling — two aspects of Mad Men that have formerly been recognized as strengths.	2	2	2		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	3. But Modern Family's reign continues unabatedThere's plenty to like about every show in the Best Comedy category, but "it's unlikely anything can stop the glorious Modern Family's march to a third straight Emmy," says TV Guide.	3	2	1	S	4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	The only potential spoiler for the ABC sitcom is CBS' The Big Bang Theory, which "keeps getting better and better as it beefs up the wacky women's roles," but it's far more likely that the Dunphy family will be adding another trophy to ABC's mantel.	3	2	2		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	4. The winners for Lead Actor/Lead Actress in a Drama are basically guaranteedThe Lead Actor and Lead Actress categories "are a lock" for Bryan Cranston of AMC's Breaking Bad and Claire Danes of Showtime's Homeland, says Kristin Dos Santos at E! Online.	2	2	1	S	4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	With three consecutive wins, Cranston is "the undefeated heavyweight champ" of the Lead Actor category and his series-best performance in Breaking Bad's fourth season should earn him a fourth trophy.	2	3	1		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	And Danes' starring turn in Homeland is "the indisputable breakout female performance of the year."	2	2	1		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	Do any of her co-nominees stand a chance?	2	2	1		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	Just "try to find a single Emmy expert predicting anyone other than Danes" and you'll have your answer.	3	1	2		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	5. But Lead Actor/Lead Actress in a Comedy are much harder to guessLouis C.K. deserves to win for his "balls-to-the-wall" starring role in FX's black comedy Louie, says Jace Lacob at The Daily Beast.	2	2	1	S	4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	But will he earn the Emmy he so richly deserves?	2	2	1		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	Not likely, says Maria Elena Fernandez; Jim Parsons' "huge sentimental moment in the finale" of The Big Bang Theory will earn him a third Emmy award.	3	2	2		4	
11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	But the seven strong performances in the Lead Actress in a Comedy category makes it "one of the toughest categories in the entire awards ceremony this year" — though the frontrunners are Julia Louis-Dreyfus for HBO's Veep and Amy Poehler for NBC's Parks and Recreation.	2	2	1		4

15	4-percent-children-u-households-lived-household-experienced-140000263	WASHINGTON, Sept. 19, 2012 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- About 2.8 million children or 3.9 percent of all children in U.S. households lived in a household in which at least one member age 12 or older experienced nonfatal violent crime in 2010, according to a report released today by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).	1	1	2		4	
15	4-percent-children-u-households-lived-household-experienced-140000263	About 6 million fewer children in 2010 than in 1993 lived in a household victimized by violence, a 68 percent decline over the 18-year period. Over a more recent 10-year period (2001–2010), the number of children living in a household that experienced violence fell about 37 percent.	1	2	2		4	
15	4-percent-children-u-households-lived-household-experienced-140000263	This BJS report estimates the prevalence of violent victimization among U.S. households with children age 17 or younger. The prevalence rate is the percentage of households in which at least one member age 12 or older experienced one or more violent victimizations in a given year. These estimates are an indicator of the extent to which children have direct and indirect exposure to violent victimization.	1	1	2		4	
15	4-percent-children-u-households-lived-household-experienced-140000263	In 2010, violent crime was about twice as prevalent in households with children (3.6 percent) compared to households without children (1.8 percent). More children lived in households where a victimization occurred outside the home (1.7 million or 2.4 percent) compared to inside the home (1.2 million or 1.7 percent).	1	2	2		4	
15	4-percent-children-u-households-lived-household-experienced-140000263	An estimated 1.1 million children lived in a household that experienced a serious violent crime, which includes rape, sexual assault, robbery and aggravated assault.

17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	"Not having a million settings forces me to think about the photo in a different way."	2	1	1		4	
17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	Cowden advises mobile photographers to make sure the lens is always clean, and to always be on the lookout for natural light.	2	1	1		4

17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	Experiment with apps.	2	1	1		4	
17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	"There is no shortage of photography apps in the App Store or Google Play.	2	1	1		4	
17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	Spend a lot of time working with different ones until you find your 'style' or something that really clicks with you," he advises.	2	1	1		4

17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	"I always try to have pictures that tell stories or at least that give a feeling," Hamelin says.	3	1	1		4	
17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	"All my pictures taken with my smartphone are made to be seen by my friends that live far away from me [in Belgium], so I try to put what I feel inside."	3	1	1		4

17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	"I have my phone on me all the time, and it has a pretty good camera attached to it.	3	2	1		4	
17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	I do usually carry my DSLR around with me, too, but sometimes it's just quicker to get that snapshot with my phone."	2	1	1		4	
17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	She explains that being able to share her photos instantly is another reason why her smartphone's camera comes in handy.	2	2	1		4	
17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	Mistry is an advocate for editing photos, but she advises mobile photographers to be smart about it.	2	1	1		4	
17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	"I know there's a lot of backlash against filters on your photos, and I can understand [that] backlash," she says.	2	1	2		4	
17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	"Which is why I say use filters, but don't abuse filters.	2	1	1		4	
17	5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258	Don't feel the need to add a filter if your photo doesn't need it.	2	1	1		4

19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	5 ways Mitt Romney can fix his Ohio problem	3	2	2		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	No Republican has won the presidency without winning Ohio, and that would appear to be true for Mitt Romney as well — without Ohio's 18 electoral college votes, the Republican nominee's path to the White House is exceedingly narrow.	3	1	2		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	The problem for Romney: He's losing Ohio.	3	1	2		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	A new Washington Post poll has President Obama up by 8 percentage points in the Buckeye State, and while "that's on the high end of recent margins," says Alexander Burns at Politico, "the trend is unambiguously in the president's favor."	2	3	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	Even with early voting moving up the vote-casting starting gun, Romney can still win Ohio — and the presidential race — but it won't be easy.	2	2	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	Here are five ways Romney can turn things around and solve his big "Ohio problem":	3	2	2		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	1. Make his Romney-Ryan bus tour countAs it turns out, this is Ohio week for the Romney campaign — the candidate and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.)	2	1	1	S	4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	are on a three-day bus tour of the state.	1	1	1	S	4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	It's the first time in three weeks that Romney and Ryan, a favorite of conservatives, have appeared together, and Romney is pushing an aggressive Ohio-specific attack on Obama letting China cheat at trade.	3	1	2		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	This is Romney's last best chance to win over his most crucial swing state, says NBC News' First Read team.	4	1	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	"If this week's bus tour doesn't move the needle, as the Romney campaign might say, they very well could decide to all but write off the Buckeye State."	3	1	2		4

19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	2. Convince Ohio voters to like him moreRomney's biggest obstacle in Ohio is that voters there just aren't that into him, says Nate Cohn at The New Republic.	3	1	2		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	Since early September, "Romney's unfavorable ratings exceeded 49 percent in every poll of likely voters," and his favorable ratings are, on average, 7 points lower.	2	2	2		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	"Obama has never been Ohio's favorite son, but it's hard to envision how Romney pulls off a comeback if a majority of voters outright dislike him."	3	1	2		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	Whether it's through glowingly positive ads or some other means, "if Romney is to have any shot at all, he needs to turn around his image over the next month."	3	1	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	3. Rev up the Republican baseEven among voters who do like Romney, he faces a notable "Ohio enthusiasm gap" with Obama, says Chris Cillizza at The Washington Post.	3	2	2	S	4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	In the new Washington Post poll, Romney and Obama fans are roughly on par in their excitement about their candidate.	3	2	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	"But, drill down another level and you see some differences emerge": 56 percent of Obama voters are "very" enthusiastic, versus 46 percent for Romney.	3	3	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	"That's not an insignificant difference when it comes to the likeliest of likely voters."	3	1	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	The poll's brutal 8-point Obama lead is based on a Democrat/Republican/Independent sample that skews Democratic: 37/30/30, says Ed Morrissey at Hot Air.	3	1	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	"That's a far cry from the [2010] midterm 36/37/28 — but it's not that far off from 2008's 39/31/30."	3	1	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	To win, Romney has to make the electorate look more like 2010 than 2008.	3	1	1		4

19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	4. Crush Obama in the debatesRomney strategists say the campaign's internal poll numbers are much tighter than the public polls, putting Romney within the margin of error.	3	1	1	S	4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	But that could mean a 4-point deficit against Obama — about the average of recent polling.	3	1	2		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	"Team Romney's hope is that they can tighten the race to just a couple of points heading into the first debate," says Politico's Burns, then "make up the rest of the difference through a combination of strong debate performances and a robust field operation."	3	2	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	That isn't too different from their national game plan, "except the stakes are even higher in Ohio."	3	1	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	5. Give up on Ohio and focus on other statesLook, "at some point in every election, it becomes clear that certain states regarded as 'tossups' are probably lost causes for one candidate or the other," says Liz Marlantes at The Christian Science Monitor, and in Ohio, we've perhaps "reached a point where Romney should just cut his losses and move on," focusing "like a laser" on Florida, Virginia, and the other remaining states "he can — and, in fact, absolutely must — win."	3	2	2	S	4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	One proponent of this theory?	1	1	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	Karl Rove, who pointedly noted on Fox News this week that "there are 11 different ways to win without Ohio."	2	1	1		4	
19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	When the man who engineered George W. Bush's 2004 victory on an Ohio-focused strategy declares "the Buckeye State a lost cause," says Alec MacGillis at The New Republic, it's probably time to listen.	3	1	2		4

21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	Pollsters tell us that the presidential debates don't really have much of an effect on who wins the White House, but that's neither accurate nor, frankly, very much fun, says Robert Draper in GQ.	3	1	2		3	
21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	In fact, "all sorts of things can happen — most of them bad — when two of the world's most insulated creatures are suddenly thrust into an oppressive atmosphere consisting of a desolate stage, grim-faced inquisitors, a stone-silent live audience, and an invisible American electorate monitoring every blink and stammer."	5	1	3		3

Romney needs a memorable zingerTeam Romney has come to believe that the debates are about creating "moments," and they've "equipped him with a series of zingers that he has memorized and has been practicing on aides since August," say Peter Baker and Ashely Parker at The New York Times.	2	2	1	S	3	
21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	That's exactly the right strategy, says Robert Shrum at The Daily Beast.	2	1	1		3

21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	Romney's job is to knock the president off-balance, and "that's not a role Romney has been comfortable with in past debates."	3	1	2		3	
21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	That was true once, but Romney's "at his best when his back is to the wall," says Edward Klein at the New York Post.	3	2	2		3	
21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	He'll attack just fine, but it's not clear he has "the skill to exploit Obama's reputation for being sensitive to criticism."	3	2	2		3	
21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	This whole election may "come down to whether Romney can get under the president's skin with well-aimed barbs and crack Obama's composure."	4	1	2		3

He should fact-check the presidentRomney and his allies have been telegraphing that he will use the debate "to turn himself into a one-man truth squad," painting Obama "as someone who can't be trusted to stick to the facts or keep his promises," says Politico's Kevin Robillard.	4	1	2	S	3	
21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	That's the right idea, but it's not as easy as it sounds, says Karl Rove at The Wall Street Journal.	3	2	2		3	
21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	Romney "can't take on the role of fact-checker-in-chief," but he "must call out the president" on his serial "untruths" but without calling him a liar — "that's too harsh a word that would backfire."	3	2	2		3

The best strategy is attack, attack, attack"The first debate will be almost exclusively on the economy," says Eric Pianin at The Fiscal Times, and that gives Romney his best shot to hammer Obama on the deficit, unemployment, and his failure to "create a more harmonious atmosphere in Washington."	4	2	3	S	3	
21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	Being negative "won't make him more likable," political analyst Larry Sabato tells The Fiscal Times, but that ship has sailed — "it is too late to reengineer Mitt Romney."	3	1	2		3	
21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	At this point, "his only real chance to break through in the debates is to be relentless in cataloging Obama's weaknesses and prosecuting his case."	3	2	2		3	
21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	Turning this from a choice into a rejection of Obama "is the only conceivable way that he wins, barring divine intervention or an October surprise."	3	2	2		3

21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	Obama can ramble and come off as smug; Romney can come off as "whiny and self-entitled," and he's "not always at his best in situations that demand spontaneity."	4	1	3		3

23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	The dilemma: Handicapping the players when so many of the potential front-runners have yet to show their game face.	2	1	2		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	Films such as Ben Affleck's "Argo" and Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman's "The Master" already are proven contenders through rapturous reactions from festival crowds or early theatrical audiences. A handful of summer releases have a shot at best-picture slots — but that depends on the movies still to come.	2	2	1		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	Late prospects include Steven Spielberg's "Lincoln," with Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th president; "The King's Speech" director Tom Hooper's "Les Miserables," the musical adaptation of Victor Hugo's classic that features Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway; "The Hurt Locker" director Kathryn Bigelow's "Zero Dark Thirty," chronicling the hunt for Osama bin Laden; and "The Lord of the Rings" creator Peter Jackson's "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," the first in his three-part "Rings" prelude.	1	1	1		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	Jackson's three "Lord of the Rings" films earned best-picture nominations, and the finale won. "The Lord of the Rings" is a heavyweight drama of a fantasy compared to the more playful "Hobbit," which could hurt the new trilogy's chances among Oscar voters, who usually lean toward weightier stories.	2	2	2		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	But since "Lord of the Rings," academy overseers expanded the best-picture category from five nominees to as many as 10 to bring in a broader range of films, including action blockbusters that often get overlooked for awards.	1	2	1		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	A big test plays out this season on that effort to make the Oscars more relevant to mainstream moviegoers. Academy bosses cited the best-picture snub of 2008's critical and commercial sensation "The Dark Knight" as a key example for expanding the category.	1	2	1		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	With reviews nearly as ecstatic as its predecessor's, the Batman finale "The Dark Knight Rises" may have a better shot depending on the number of nominees, which will range from five to 10 based on voting results among the nearly 6,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.	2	2	1		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	Or the film may fall victim to the academy's general distaste for fantastical tales. Comic-book adaptations have been money magnets for Hollywood, yet no superhero saga has managed a best-picture nomination so far.	2	1	2		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	"You don't get into the business of making these kinds of films with any thought toward awards," said Christopher Nolan, director of the current Batman franchise. "If that's what's of interest to you, then if you look at the odds, you're far better off making a very different kind of film."	2	1	2		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	The same may hold for this year's biggest hit, the superhero mash-up "The Avengers," which also earned terrific reviews but has little best-picture buzz among Hollywood odds-makers.	2	2	1		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	Even "Avengers" director Joss Whedon avoids thinking about awards possibilities.	2	1	2		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	"It would be a lovely thought, but I don't go there in my mind," said Whedon, who was floored when he shared a screenplay Oscar nomination for 1995's "Toy Story." ''When we got nominated for 'Toy Story,' it was like, 'What are you talking about? Is this a prank?' Anything's possible, but if you start to go down that road, you make yourself crazy."	2	2	2		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	A late-summer threesome of film festivals — Venice, Toronto and Telluride — premiered many potential contenders for the Oscars, whose nominations come out Jan. 10, with the ceremony following on Feb. 24.	2	2	1		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	Among festival prospects: "The Master," directed by Paul Thomas Anderson ("There Will Be Blood"), with Phoenix as a combustible World War II veteran who falls under the sway of a cult leader (Hoffman); "Argo," with Affleck starring in and directing a thriller about the rescue of six Americans who evaded the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979; "Anna Karenina," director Joe Wright's fanciful adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's tragic romance, starring Keira Knightley, Jude Law and Aaron Taylor-Johnson; and "Silver Linings Playbook," from director David O. Russell ("The Fighter"), featuring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro in a comic drama about two deeply troubled souls finding romance.	1	1	1		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	Earlier independent releases might creep into the best-picture race, among them the youthful dramas "Moonrise Kingdom" and "Beasts of the Southern Wild." But that depends on the late-comers premiering over the next three months.	2	1	1		4	
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	Along with "Lincoln," ''Les Miserables," ''Zero Dark Thirty" and "The Hobbit," the lineup includes Robert Zemeckis' airline drama "Flight," starring Denzel Washington; the Alfred Hitchcock tale "Hitchcock," with Anthony Hopkins as the filmmaker, Helen Mirren as his wife and Scarlett Johansson as "Psycho" co-star Janet Leigh; Quentin Tarantino's Civil War-era bounty-hunter saga "Django Unchained," featuring Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio; and the shipwreck story "Life of Pi," from director Ang Lee ("Brokeback Mountain").	1	1	1		4

24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	(Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union has asked for a second time that the Supreme Court invalidate Myriad Genetics Inc's patents on two genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, the latest salvo in a case with broad consequences for the future of gene-based medicine.				i	4	
24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	The lawsuit against Myriad and the University of Utah Research Foundation, which hold patents that allow the company to control testing for the genes, alleges that the patents are illegal and restrict scientific research and patients' access to medical care.				i	4	
24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	The lawsuit was filed by the ACLU and the Public Patent Foundation on behalf of medical associations, geneticists, patients and breast cancer and women's health groups, the ACLU said on Tuesday.	1	1	1		4	
24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	The Supreme Court had sent back the ACLU's previous lawsuit to the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.	1	1	1		4	
24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	It asked the appeals court to reconsider an earlier decision upholding the patents in light of a March decision by the high court that rejected a similar case about a patented method for monitoring a patient's blood.	1	1	2		4	
24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	However by a 2-1 vote, the appeals court in August again ruled that companies can obtain patents on genes.	1	1	1		4	
24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	The Supreme Court is not required to take up the case and will likely first give Myriad a chance to respond before deciding whether to hear the case or let the appeals court ruling stand.	1	1	1		4	
24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	"In our view, the court of appeals did not fully consider or correctly apply the Supreme Court's most recent and relevant patent law decisions," ACLU attorney Chris Hansen said in a statement.	3	1	1		4	
24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	Myriad did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the ACLU action.	1	1	1		4	
24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	The genes in question, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can be used to detect risk of breast and ovarian cancer and to help inform treatment options.	1	3	1		4	
24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	Women who test positive using Myriad's gene test, called BRACAnalysis, have an 82 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer and a 44 percent higher risk of ovarian cancer in their lifetimes.	1	1	3		4

25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — An Afghan soldier turned his gun on American troops at a checkpoint in the country's east, killing two Americans and two fellow members of Afghanistan's army in a shooting that marked both the continuance of a disturbing trend of insider attacks and the 2,000th US troop death in the long-running war, officials said Sunday.	2	1	4		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	The string of insider attacks is one of the greatest threats to NATO's mission in the country, endangering a partnership key to training up Afghan security forces and withdrawing international troops.	1	1	3		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	Saturday's shooting took place at an Afghan army checkpoint just outside a joint U.S.-Afghan base in Wardak province, said Shahidullah Shahid, a provincial government spokesman.	1	1	3		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	At least two Afghan soldiers died, he said.	1	1	4		4

25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	He said investigators had been sent to the site to try to figure out what happened.	2	1	1		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	It was not clear if the assailant was killed.	2	1	3		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	The attack happened about 5 p.m. in Sayd Abad district, Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Zahir Azimi said in an emailed statement.	1	1	3		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	He did not provide further details.	1	1	1		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	NATO forces announced the assault early Sunday morning, saying only that it was "suspected insider attack" and that a NATO service member and civilian contractor were killed.	3	1	4		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	One U.S. official confirmed that the service member killed was American, while another confirmed that the civilian was also American.	1	1	4		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the nationality of the dead had not yet been formally announced.	2	1	2		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	Afghan soldiers and policemen — or militants in their uniforms — have gunned down more than 50 foreign troops so far this year, eroding the trust between coalition forces and their Afghan partners.	2	1	4		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	An equal number of Afghan policemen and soldiers also died in these attacks, giving them reason as well to be suspicious of possible infiltrators within their ranks.	2	1	4		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	The attacks are taking a toll on the partnership between international and Afghan forces, prompting the U.S. military to restrict operations with small-sized Afghan units earlier this month.	3	1	2		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	The close contact — with coalition forces working side by side with Afghan troops as advisers, mentors and trainers — is a key part of the U.S. strategy for preparing the Afghans to take the lead in security operations as the U.S. and other nations prepare to pull out their last combat troops at the end of 2014, just 27 months away.	2	1	1		4	
25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	The number of American military dead reflects an Associated Press count of those members of the armed services killed inside Afghanistan since the U.S.-led invasion on Oct. 7, 2001.	2	1	3		4

27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	LONDON (Reuters) - The impact of South African mine labour unrest has spread beyond precious metals to UG2 chrome ore, a by product of platinum and key ingredient in stainless steel, with output cuts putting a floor under prices after four months of decline.	2	1	2		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	In recent months, violent labour unrest over pay has disrupted production at some of the largest South African platinum mines, including those owned by Anglo American Platinum, Lonmin and Aquarius Platinum.	1	1	2		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	South Africa accounts for more than 80 percent of global platinum supply, but it also produces over half of the world's chrome.	1	1	1		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	Both markets are in global surplus, but uncertainty created by production cuts has induced fresh buying.	1	2	2		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	Although disputes at some south African shafts have been resolved, strikes are in full force at others and continuing to spread, raising worries that prolonged disruptions might hit production further.	1	1	3		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	So far strikes have cut output of UG2 chrome ore by about 150,000-250,000 tonnes, market players said, a significant enough amount to have an effect on prices, even in an over supplied market.	2	1	2		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	"The strikes in Lonmin have removed about 100,000 tonnes a month of UG2 which is no small amount," said a European ferrochrome trader, adding an additional 50,000-80,000 tonnes have been cut due to strikes at other mines.	3	1	2		3

27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	The reduced output has stemmed a 4-month price decline in ferrochrome - the processed product of chrome, with projections now looking at rising values even though economic slowdown has depressed demand from stainless steel makers, industry players said.	2	2	2		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	Prices of high carbon ferrochrome in Europe stand at around $1.02-1.10 per lb in Europe, with low carbon material selling at between $2.05 and 2.10 per lb.	1	1	1		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	Prices have fallen by around 10 percent in the last four months.	1	2	2		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	"There is an output reduction although it is difficult to assess how much; this has already been priced in platinum but not in the chrome and ferrochrome yet," an industry source said.	2	1	2		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	"Producers can still rely on stocks for now but these stocks are not been replenished and when the Chinese come back to the market after the National Day holiday next week prices will likely rise especially if the problems in South Africa continue."	3	2	3		3

27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	While the loss of output is expected to be significant, its effect is likely to be only temporary as platinum miners should quickly make up for the lost supply once operations restart, market players said.	3	2	2		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	UG2 chrome ore, which has a lower chrome content compared to chrome ore, was considered waste by platinum miners until a few years ago.	1	1	1		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	More recently however, technological developments have made it possible to use this by-product as a raw material for stainless steel ingredient ferrochrome and UG2 chrome now makes up for about 50-70 percent of South Africa total chrome ore export, an industry analyst said.	1	2	1		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	Although it is difficult to estimate South Africa's UG2 chrome ore production as stocks figures are not available, domestic consumption and exports stood at 2-3 million tonnes per annum in the last three years.	1	1	1		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	Traders said longer-term plans by firms to process more UG2 chrome from South Africa are likely to put pressure on prices from next year when new capacity is expected to come on stream.	1	2	2		3	
27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	"That's one of the sources where we could see more material coming from next year and it can have a negative impact on chrome (prices) considering the stainless steel market is still pretty awful at the moment," a second European trader said.	3	2	3		3

30	al-qaeda-north-africa-making-millions-kidnapping-u-155011734	BERLIN (Reuters) - Islamist militants are increasingly funding themselves through kidnapping, with al Qaeda's north African wing likely to have brought in tens of millions of dollars in ransoms in the past few years, a senior U.S. Treasury official said.	3	1	4		4	
30	al-qaeda-north-africa-making-millions-kidnapping-u-155011734	The United States estimates militant organizations received $120 million in ransoms over the past decade, including to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in recent years, said David Cohen, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.	4	1	3		4	
30	al-qaeda-north-africa-making-millions-kidnapping-u-155011734	Kidnapping for ransom was an "urgent threat", particularly in the Sahel, a belt of land spanning nearly a dozen of the world's poorest nations on the Sahara's southern rim, Cohen told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday.	3	1	3		4	
30	al-qaeda-north-africa-making-millions-kidnapping-u-155011734	"It is what has become perhaps the most challenging and fastest growing technique that terrorist organizations, in particular the affiliates of al Qaeda in North Africa and in Yemen, have been using to fund themselves over the last couple of years."	3	1	3		4	
30	al-qaeda-north-africa-making-millions-kidnapping-u-155011734	Cohen said the average ransom had gone up consistently over the years and was in the range of $5 million per payment.	2	1	2		4	
30	al-qaeda-north-africa-making-millions-kidnapping-u-155011734	"So, it is a growing and really quite urgent threat, particularly in North Africa, in the Sahel and in Mali in particular, where AQIM has now managed to claim dominion over a large territory."	3	1	4		4

31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) — A member of an Alaska militia group was sentenced Monday to five years in federal prison for his conviction on weapons charges in a case involving others convicted of conspiring to kill government officials.	1	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	Coleman Barney of North Pole held his head in his hands and sniffled loudly while he waited for U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan to impose the sentence Monday in Anchorage.	1	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	"I think you got into some real bad stuff here, and this sentence reflects it," Bryan said.	2	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	Barney, 38, and two other defendants have been in custody since their March 2011 arrests. The judge said Barney's time already served will count toward his term.	1	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	Barney was convicted in June of conspiracy to possess unregistered silencers and grenades, and possession of an unregistered 37 mm projectile launcher loaded with a "hornet's nest" anti-personnel round that contained rubber pellets. Bryan's sentence was five years for each of the two charges, with the terms running concurrently.	1	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	Barney's attorney, Tim Dooley, said he will appeal.	1	1	1		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	Schaeffer Cox, the leader of the Fairbanks-based Alaska Peacemaker Militia, and another militia member, Lonnie Vernon, are scheduled for sentencing Nov. 19 on more serious charges, including conspiracy to commit murder. Members of the tiny militia claimed the group would protect families and property if the federal government collapsed.	1	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	A jury at the men's trial deadlocked on a murder conspiracy charge against Barney and acquitted him of two other charges: possession of hand-grenade parts that Cox had loaded into Barney's trailer as Cox prepared to move out of Alaska, and a count of carrying firearms during a crime of violence.	1	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	Before he was sentenced, Barney apologized for making poor choices and decisions. A member of the Mormon church, he said he loved his country and that the militia started out as a group of "wonderful Christian men" who wanted to protect their families in case of a collapse. He said he got caught up in the hype and said things he didn't mean.	1	2	1		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	Barney asked the judge to let him go back to his family.	1	1	1		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	"There won't ever be any problems with me," he said. "I'm not a violent man."	1	2	1		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	Prosecutors had sought a 10-year sentence, saying Barney knew about the murder conspiracy, even discussing it at length with Cox and others.	1	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	Barney was a confidante of Cox and then tried to minimize his actions, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Yvonne Lamoureux. She noted there was no dispute that Barney is a family man and a hard worker, "which makes it all the more difficult to understand how he got to this point."	2	2	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	Dooley said prosecutors were trying to sentence Barney for things he wasn't convicted of. He pushed for a sentence of time served or house arrest.	1	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	"Beyond that would be corruption of justice," Dooley said.	2	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	Authorities have said the men advocated the "241" retaliation plan, which stood for "two-for-one" — killing or kidnapping two officials for any member of Cox' group who might be killed or arrested, an event that never happened. During its investigation, the FBI used an informant to infiltrate the group. He recorded more than 100 hours of conversations.	1	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	The plot arose after Cox was charged with misdemeanor weapons misconduct. He represented himself at a pretrial hearing, where he rejected the Alaska court system as a legitimate judiciary. Cox said he would not attend another hearing until the court system explained its authority over him.	1	1	2		4	
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	A warrant was issued for his arrest when he failed to appear for trial in that case in February 2011. Until his arrest, Cox went into hiding with his family at Barney's home, prosecutors said.	1	1	2		4	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	'Alcohol enemas': A frightening new hazing trend?	1	1	2		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	The University of Tennessee has suspended a fraternity for 30 days after one of its members was dumped at a hospital with a blood alcohol level of "well over" 0.4 percent, five times the legal limit for driving and clearly within what doctors call the "death zone" for alcohol poisoning.				I	3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	The thing is, the 20-year-old student hadn't been drinking, exactly.	2	1	1		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	According to Knoxville police, he and his Pi Kappa Alpha frat brothers had been giving one another "alcohol enemas."	1	1	1		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	University officials were appalled.	1	1	2		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	"Shock would not be an [overstatement]," says Tim Rogers, vice chancellor of student life.	2	1	2		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	"I myself had never heard of what has been alleged."	1	1	1		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	What are alcohol enemas, and how popular have they become?	1	1	1		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	What, exactly, is an alcohol enema?Unfortunately, it's pretty much what it sounds like: A tube is inserted in the rectum and alcohol is poured directly into the colon.	2	1	2		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	A more colloquial name is "butt chugging."	1	1	1		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	In the Tennessee case, police say they found several bags from boxes of wine scattered around the fraternity, along with several passed-out guys.	1	1	2		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	It isn't, apparently, a pain-free way to get blitzed: The student who was admitted to the hospital was "extremely intoxicated and showed signs of physical and possible sexual assault," the police report says.	2	1	4		3

32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	And this gets you drunk?Yes, and fast.	2	1	1		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	According to the Knoxville police, the frat guys apparently used "rubber tubing inserted into their rectums as a conduit for alcohol, as the abundance of capillaries and blood vessels present [in the area] greatly heightens the level and speed of the alcohol entering the bloodstream as it bypasses the filtering by the liver."				I	3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	That's what makes alcohol enemas so dangerous, gastroenterologist Dr. Preston Stewart tells CNN.	1	1	3		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	Our stomachs and livers use an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase to break down alcohol and make it less toxic, but booze enters the bloodstream unfiltered when it's poured into the gastrointestinal tract.	1	1	2		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	So why not just down shots?Presumably part of the draw is that "you get totally plastered at a much faster rate," says Mary Fischer at The Stir, who says that when she was at the University of Tennessee, "the worst thing anyone ever did was funnel a few beers or partake in a keg stand or two."				I	3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	Boredom or curiosity may also have driven the enema recipients, Dr. Aaron White, at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), tells CNN.	2	1	1		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	"In the past year or so there have been several stories about young people finding unique ways to get alcohol in their bodies," in part because they think it will prevent vomiting and hangovers.	1	2	2		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	But throwing up excess alcohol, he notes, is one way your body keeps you alive.	1	2	2		3

32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	Was this a hazing incident?The UT chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha was cited for hazing in 2008, but the university thinks this was just a high-risk boozing incident.	2	1	2		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	The student isn't new to the university or the fraternity, and hazing is usually associated with pledging.	1	1	2		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	In any case, says Joslyn Gray at Babble, "you don't need a college degree to understand that it's never a good idea to get your party planning tips from a Jackass movie."	2	1	1		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	How common is "butt chugging"?Hard to say; we don't have reliable specific numbers.	3	1	1		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	More generally, about 1,825 college students 18 to 24 die each year from alcohol-related injuries, according to NIAAA figures.	1	1	4		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	It's not uncommon to hear of a new exotic routes to intoxication — besides "butt-chugging," thrill-seekers have been known to insert vodka-soaked tampons into the vagina or anus, or indulge in "vodka eyeballing."	2	1	4		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	And it's not just college students: A Texas man died in 2004 after his wife gave him a sherry enema.	1	1	3		3	
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	Alcohol enemas are "extraordinarily dangerous," says the NIAAA's White, "but people shouldn't get the impression that it's a widespread phenomenon."	2	1	3		3

36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	Inc has asked a federal judge to throw out Apple Inc's false advertising claim in a lawsuit challenging the online retailer's use of the "app store" name.	2	1	3	S	4	
36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	The claim is part of a March 2011 trademark lawsuit in which Apple, which this year became the world's largest company ever by market value, accused Amazon of misusing its "App Store" name to solicit developers for a mobile software download service.	2	1	2		4	
36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	Apple added the trademark claim last November, soon after Amazon announced the launch of the Kindle Fire tablet and, according to the complaint, began to call its app store "Amazon Appstore" rather than "Amazon Appstore for Android."	1	1	2		4	
36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	It said this change could have contributed to confusion among consumers.	2	1	2		4	
36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	But in a filing on Wednesday with the U.S. District Court in Oakland, California, Amazon said the term "app store" has become so generic that its use could not constitute false advertising.	2	1	1		4	
36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	Amazon added that even Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and his predecessor Steve Jobs have used the term to discuss rivals, with Cook having commented on "the number of app stores out there" and Jobs referring to the "four app stores on Android."	3	1	1		4	
36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	"Apple presumably does not contend that its past and current CEOs made false statements regarding to those other app stores to thousands of investors in earnings calls," Amazon said.	3	1	2		4	
36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	"To the contrary, the use of the term 'app store' to refer to stores selling apps is commonplace in the industry."	3	1	1		4	
36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, declined to comment.	1	1	2		4	
36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	Apple is based in Cupertino, California, and Amazon in Seattle.	1	1	1		4	
36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	A hearing on Amazon's motion is scheduled for October 31, and a trial is scheduled for August 19, 2013.	1	1	1		4

37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	HAVANA (Reuters) - Alan Gross, the American government contractor jailed in Cuba for crimes against the state, could be suffering from an untreated cancer, according to an independent review of his medical records, his U.S. lawyer said on Tuesday.	3	1	3		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	"Gross has a potentially life-threatening medical problem that has not been adequately evaluated to modern medical standards," U.S.-based radiologist Alan Cohen said in a statement released by Gross attorney Jared Genser.	3	1	3		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	Genser said Cohen had reviewed CT and ultrasound scans performed by Cuban doctors of an unidentified mass behind Gross's right shoulder, which wife Judy Gross cited after a recent visit to her husband.	3	1	3		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	The Cuban physicians diagnosed the mass as a "hematoma" and told Gross in May that it would disappear within a few months, according to Genser.	2	2	2		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	As Gross has lost 105 pounds (47 kg) since his arrest in December 2009, Cohen concluded Gross's right-shoulder mass is in urgent need of proper medical evaluation, including an MRI "and potentially a biopsy, preferably in a facility in the United States, immediately."	2	1	4		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	A "soft tissue mass in an adult who has lost considerable weight must be assumed to represent a malignant tumor unless proven to be benign," said Cohen.	2	2	2		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	The Cuban government had no immediate comment on Cohen's statement, but previously has said Gross was in "normal" health.	2	2	2		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	Gross, jailed in Cuba since December 3, 2009, is serving a 15-year sentence for illegally providing Internet equipment and service to Cuban Jewish groups under a U.S. program promoting political change that the Cuban government considers subversive.	3	2	3		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	His arrest stalled a brief period of progress in U.S.-Cuba relations that have been mostly bad since Cuba's 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power and turned the island communist.	2	2	3		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	The latest doctor's report was seized upon by Genser and Judy Gross, who have been demanding that Cuba allow an independent medical expert to examine Gross.	1	1	2		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	"Cuban government doctors are either guilty of gross professional negligence or they are intentionally hiding what could be a lethal condition," Genser said.	3	1	4		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	"President Castro, I beg you not to let my husband die on your watch.	4	1	4		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	Your country claims to have such a wonderful health care system - yet why have your doctors misdiagnosed him and failed to order the right tests to determine what is actually happening?"	4	1	4		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	Judy Gross said.				S	5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	"Please let us have Alan diagnosed by a doctor of his choosing before it is too late," she said.	3	1	3		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	Cuba prides itself on its medical system, which provides free care to all, but suffers from equipment and medicine shortages the government blames on the long-standing U.S. trade embargo against the communist island.	3	2	2		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	Gross has asked Cuba to let him go home for two weeks to visit his mother and daughter, both of whom have cancer.	2	2	2		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	He has promised to return and serve his sentence, but Cuba has not responded.	2	2	2		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	Cuba has said it proposed talks with the United States about resolving the Gross case but has received no answer.	2	2	2		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	It has hinted at the possibility of a swap of Gross for five Cuban agents imprisoned in the United States, a deal Washington has rejected.	3	2	2		5	
37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	It said that Gross could be in a prison but is serving his time in a military hospital.	2	2	2		5

38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	ARLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — Don Trachte's cowlick has been tamed. Mary Hall is no longer a towhead. Butch Corbett is still thin, but not the beanpole he once was. And Tom Paquin's carrot top is thinner and grayer.	4	2	1			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	Twenty or so people who were children when they posed in the 1940s for their neighbor Norman Rockwell in the small Vermont town of Arlington are reuniting Saturday to share their memories of the great American artist who once lived in their midst.	2	3	1			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	Rockwell captured scenes of everyday life in his paintings and illustrations for covers of Saturday Evening Post, the Boy Scouts and its publication Boys' Life, art now considered the very definition of Americana. He would pay his neighbors $5 a pop to appear in Hallmark cards, in calendars and on magazine covers that ended up gracing the coffee tables and littering the tree houses of millions of magazine readers young and old.	1	2	2			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	"The Saturday Evening Post came out weekly, and we couldn't wait to get it to see what was on the cover," said Hall, who posed for Rockwell four times. "You could always recognize who it was."	2	2	1			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	She appeared as a blond girl wrapped in a quilt and being carried out of a flood by a Boy Scout in an image that became a cover of Boys' Life, and as a teenager in a skirt, white blouse, bobby socks and loafers on a Post cover from 1948. It was called "Christmas Home Coming" and showed people welcoming a boy home from school who's carrying a suitcase full of dirty laundry.	1	3	2			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	An estimated 300 people from the area modeled for Rockwell during his 14 years in the southern Vermont town. Of the 70 or so still living, the oldest is 93 (he can't make it to the reunion). Many still live in and around Arlington.	1	3	2			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	The former models have gotten together before, but this weekend is special. They have been invited to view a new gallery of Rockwell prints and memorabilia that is taking the place of a recently closed Rockwell museum. The new owners are treating them to a turkey lunch presented in the style of Rockwell's famous painting of an excited family gathered for Thanksgiving dinner.	2	3	1			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	"I think it's important that the models keep the tradition of the image that Vermont, Arlington in particular, was important in Norman Rockwell's biography. That while he lived in Arlington he did his best work, probably ... and his local models were Arlington people," said James "Buddy" Edgerton, 82, who lived next door to Rockwell, his wife and three sons and modeled for him at least a dozen times.	2	3	1			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	Rockwell was a full-fledged member of the town, attending school basketball games and square dances, and had a great sense of humor, his neighbors recall. But as one of America's foremost artists, he could be as precise as any high-fashion photographer.	3	3	1			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	He would first have the models photographed and then would sketch a drawing. Sometimes the session in his studio took minutes, sometimes several hours. He always had a pipe in his mouth, and he joked around with the kids to make them comfortable.	1	3	1			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	"Rockwell had these images in his head, and he wanted you to smile or be wide-eyed in a certain way. You have to be a little actor, you see, and I probably was a little embarrassed," said Trachte, who was 5 or 6 when he posed for a painting of a little boy and girl in pajamas, holding hands and peering up at Santa Claus.	1	2	2			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	Rockwell knew just what he wanted, instructing the children to sit or stand in certain positions with particular expressions and to wear certain clothing, often providing Scout uniforms, or in one case, the velvet outfit that Hall wore for the cover of an edition of the book "Little Lord Fauntleroy."	1	1	1			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	"I find his detail just amazing," said Hall, whose father was a real estate agent who sold Rockwell his first and second home in town.	2	3	1			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	She noted that Rockwell managed to paint the small piece of tape around her leg from a sprained ankle that appeared above her bobby sock: "He didn't miss the details."	1	2	2			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	Edgerton — who went on to write the memoir "The Unknown Rockwell: A Portrait of Two American Families," about a farm boy growing up next door to the Rockwells — modeled for his neighbor at least a dozen times, mostly as a Scout, with his image published in four calendars.	1	1	1			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	The last time he modeled was in 1964, after Rockwell had moved about 65 miles away to Stockbridge, Mass., now home to the Norman Rockwell Museum. Edgerton appeared as a Scoutmaster with his son, then 9, as a Scout in a painting called "Growth of a Leader," showing four profiles of a Scout from a child to an adult with a graying sideburn — much like Edgerton has today.	1	2	1			
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	"He was wonderful guy," Edgerton said. "He made you feel you were the most important person in the world when you were doing it."	3	4	1

40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	The Labor Department added a new wrinkle to the presidential campaign on Thursday, when it reported that the economy actually added 386,000 more jobs than previously thought from April 2011 to March 2012.	2	1	1		4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	President Obama's team welcomed the revised figures, saying they proved "we are making progress" toward recovering "from the worst crisis since the Great Depression."	3	3	2		4

40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	Here, four significant points to consider:	3	1	1		4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	1. We shouldn't be shocked by these revisionsThis doesn't mean companies went "on a previously undetected hiring spree," says Ben Casselman at The Wall Street Journal.	3	1	1	S	4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	"The Labor Department just got access to better data."	1	2	1		4

40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	2. And should treat the monthly jobs reports with a grain of saltPoliticians and economists always pounce when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly jobs report, says Brad Plumer at The Washington Post.	3	1	1	S	4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	But this latest revision "suggests that we could all probably stand" to cool it a bit.	2	1	1		4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	Why put so much emphasis on numbers that are "almost never the last word on how the economy’s actually performing"?	3	1	1		4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	In 2009, "the economy actually lost 902,000 more jobs than the monthly jobs reports had initially suggested."	2	1	2		4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	In 2011, it turns out the jobs reports underestimated the number of jobs being created by an average of 67,000 jobs per month.	2	1	1		4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	3. This deprives Romney of a key talking pointThis news is great for America, but terrible for Mitt Romney, says Steve Benen at MSNBC.	2	2	2	S	4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	He probably was looking forward to arguing in next week's debate "that the economy hasn't added any new jobs during Obama's term."	3	1	2		4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	That talking point "was always ridiculous," given that employment was already plummeting downward when Obama took office, making it grossly unfair to pin early 2009 job losses on him.	4	1	2		4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	Now, though, Romney's "talking point is off the table entirely," because the new figures mean the economy has added a net total of 125,000 jobs on Obama's watch, instead of losing 261,000 as previously estimated.	3	2	1		4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	"It also means more jobs were created in Obama's first four years than during George W. Bush's first four years — and Bush didn't inherit a global economic catastrophe."	3	2	1		4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	4. But the GOP still has plenty of ammo against ObamaThe fact that the Labor Department just "magically" created a bunch of jobs "changes nothing," says Conn Carroll at The Washington Examiner.	4	2	2	S	4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	The job market today is still "incredibly weak," and it "has gotten weaker the past two months."	2	1	2		4	
40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	Not only that, but the employment news was offset by a fresh flurry of scary economic data — durable good orders fell in August by the most since the recession, and second-quarter economic growth was downgraded from 1.7 percent to 1.3 percent.	3	1	2		4

42	analysis-bomb-ticks-eads-pact-politics-cloud-merger-193310637--finance	PARIS (Reuters) - Doubts are growing over the resilience of a Franco-German shareholder pact at the heart of EADS , placing a new timebomb under $45-billion European merger talks with British defense contractor BAE Systems .	3	1	3		3	
42	analysis-bomb-ticks-eads-pact-politics-cloud-merger-193310637--finance	With firms already racing an October 10 deadline to overcome growing political obstacles, fears over what would happen as core EADS industrial partners seek to disinvest have set the fuse on further discord within months if BAE talks break down.	4	1	3		3	
42	analysis-bomb-ticks-eads-pact-politics-cloud-merger-193310637--finance	After acting as a power-sharing mechanism for over a decade, the pact which balances national interests via stakes held by the French state, French conglomerate Lagardere and German engineer Daimler will be wound up if EADS and BAE forge the world's largest defense company.	4	2	2		3	
42	analysis-bomb-ticks-eads-pact-politics-cloud-merger-193310637--finance	But so fragile has the partially confidential pact become, as Lagardere and Daimler prepare to sell stakes to concentrate on core businesses, that there are doubts whether the status quo would hold for more than a year even if the British merger talks fail and EADS tries to return to business as usual.	3	1	2		3	
42	analysis-bomb-ticks-eads-pact-politics-cloud-merger-193310637--finance	That could promote fresh arguments between French and German politicians over control of one of Europe's strategic companies, without the rights or guarantees the pact now offers.	3	1	2		3

42	analysis-bomb-ticks-eads-pact-politics-cloud-merger-193310637--finance	EADS was born from a merger of French, German and Spanish interests in 2000 with a unique structure allowing the Paris government and Daimler to cohabit at arm's length.	2	1	1		3

42	analysis-bomb-ticks-eads-pact-politics-cloud-merger-193310637--finance	Secondly, a frustrated Daimler has for months been seeking ways to sell some of its shares to the German state without blowing up the very Franco-German pact it helped design; it is unlikely to pass up any chance to sell when Lagardere opts out.	4	1	3		3

42	analysis-bomb-ticks-eads-pact-politics-cloud-merger-193310637--finance	Even without the first rule, the larger pact would collapse once Daimler fell below a 10-percent holding in EADS unless the French government also were to sell some of its shares, which it has so far refused to do.	3	1	3		3

43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	An enduring part of market lore is the notion that gains in the well-known Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> do not hold unless similar moves in the Dow Jones transportation average <.DJT> "confirm" them.	2	1	1		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	Strategists tend to look askance when they see steady rises in the 30-stock industrial index when the transportation average is not doing well.	2	1	2		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	The idea behind this part of "Dow theory" is that manufacturers as well as the railroads, shippers and trucking companies that move their goods are barometers of the U.S. economy's performance.	1	1	1		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	That makes the recent moves in these averages somewhat ominous.	2	1	2		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	Over the last six months, the Dow industrials have gained 2.9 percent, while the transports have fallen by 5.6 percent.	1	2	2		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	This is not the first time that industrials have rocketed upward while the transports were suggesting caution.	2	2	2		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	Transportation stocks hit a peak in mid-1999 but later started to slip, while the Dow continued to rally through early 2000 before stumbling.	2	2	2		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	In recent months, most railroads and truckers have reported lower shipping volumes as consumers and businesses have worried about the weakening global economy and possible changes in U.S. tax regulations.	2	1	2		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	The resulting profit warnings have pressured transport shares.	1	1	2		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	Until now, stimulus from the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are helping to keep transport stocks from steeper losses, said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont.	2	2	2		3

43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	"It might not take much to break those technical levels," which have held for about six months, he warned.	2	1	2		3

43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	Another red flag is that analysts have been cutting their third-quarter earnings forecasts at the same time the market is going up.	1	1	2		3

43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	That is in stark contrast with their estimates of a 3.1 percent rise when the quarter began on July 1.	2	2	1		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	To be sure, not all analysts subscribe to the Dow theory that transportation stocks are a leading indicator of the broader markets, now that manufacturing is a smaller part of the overall economy.	2	1	1		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	"The Dow theory did a lot better in the 1960s and 1970s, when manufacturing ruled the economy," said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.	2	2	1		3	
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	The Dow transportation average "is not as great a signal in the last couple of decades, when you now have a much more broadly based, diversified economy."	1	1	1		3

44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has a prescription for controlling soaring costs within the $2.8 trillion U.S. healthcare system, partly by making consumers pay more of their own medical bills.	2	2	2		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	Romney's vow to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul has played prominently in the campaign, even as Romney has offered few details about his alternative.	2	2	1		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	But as he prepares to face Obama in their first presidential debate on Wednesday, Romney is giving a few hints.	1	1	1		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	The former Massachusetts governor's advisers say he would accelerate the use of high-deductible insurance plans that offer lower premiums but require beneficiaries to pay thousands of dollars more in out-of-pocket expenses than they would face under conventional coverage.	2	2	2		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	Romney's overriding aim is to create a much bigger retail market in healthcare, with transparency on pricing and services, more flexible insurance pools and interstate insurance markets.	2	3	1		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	That would allow consumers to choose up front what products and services to buy and from whom, according to the Romney campaign.	3	3	1		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	But consumers would cover most routine medical expenses themselves, including annual check-ups, with assistance from health savings accounts and new tax breaks intended to align the private markets for group and individual insurance that cover more than 160 million people.	2	1	2		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	"The result," Romney wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine, "will be patients who can confidently choose the coverage that is right for them, who know and care what healthcare costs."	3	3	1		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	The Romney campaign says its series of changes differ dramatically from Obama's 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which requires most Americans to buy health coverage and seeks to make it easier to do that by creating state-based insurance exchanges.	3	2	1		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	Medicaid, the national program for the poor, would be expanded to accommodate those with low incomes.	1	2	1		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	Romney's approach is a political departure for him.	2	2	1		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	In Massachusetts, he oversaw the passage of comprehensive state healthcare changes that later became the model for "Obamacare," the president's federal program.	1	1	1		4	
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	Romney's role in creating the Massachusetts plan made many conservatives wary of him, and in seeking the Republican nomination for president Romney made a point of rejecting Obama's plan as an illegal overreach by the federal government.	3	1	2		4

44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	Analysts say the use of heath savings accounts favors the affluent, while statistics indicate that high-deductible plans can mean big out-of-pocket costs for people with lower wages and little disposable income.	3	1	3		4

44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	But Romney advisers say the approach strikes at two major contributors to spiraling medical prices: a federal tax exclusion on employer-sponsored health plans and conventional benefit packages that insulate consumers from the true cost of healthcare through co-payments and limited deductibles.	3	2	1		4

47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	After an enormous iceberg called B-15 broke off from Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf, it released chunks of ice — themselves massive icebergs — that wreaked havoc on emperor penguins that breed to the west.	2	1	2		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	But this doesn't appear to have been the case for a population of Weddell seals whose breeding sites were also in the icebergs' path, new research has found.	2	2	2		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	The calving of the 4,250-square-mile (1,100 square kilometers) B-15 iceberg gave researchers a unique opportunity to examine how living things respond to an extreme event in their environment — in this case, the arrival of the chunks of B-15.	2	3	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	Previous research has examined the impact of extreme events on emperor penguins.	1	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	At one of the penguin breeding sites, collisions between the icebergs and the ice on which the penguins were nesting killed some and forced others to move to less-ideal breeding sites.	1	1	3		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	At another site, an iceberg blocked the penguins' route to the open water where they feed, a research team led by Gerald Kooyman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography reported in 2007.	2	1	2		4

47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	In the latest study, another team looked at how the icebergs affected the seals living in Erebus Bay on the Ross Sea.	1	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	Scientists have been monitoring the seal population there since 1969, and they honed in on the period from 2001 through 2005, when the remnants of B-15, which calved in 2000, passed through.	2	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	"Here, what we found is a pretty mild effect on the seals," said Thierry Chambert, a doctoral candidate at Montana State University and the lead researcher on the project.	2	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	"They survived pretty well during the five years of iceberg presence, but their reproduction was lower than usual."	2	2	2		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	Chambert and colleagues focused on female seals, since they are more reliably spotted on the ice than males.	1	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	They found that in four of the five years in which the icebergs were present, the number of females that showed up at the colony was lower than usual.	1	1	2		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	In addition, the probability that an individual female would be alive the following year did not change, but reproduction rates dropped.	1	1	2		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	In years without icebergs, there is a nearly 70-percent chance a female will give birth to a pup.	1	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	During the iceberg years, this dropped by about 20 percentage points, down to a 50-percent chance.	1	1	2		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	How seals respond	1	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	Researchers don't know why the icebergs had the effect on the seals that they did, but they have some hypotheses.	2	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	The icebergs may have made the seals' breeding sites more difficult to access by altering the terrain of the sea ice.	2	1	2		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	Other work has shown that the icebergs had a negative effect on the amount of tiny, floating plants, called phytoplankton, in the sea.	1	1	2		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	This effect could have rippled up the food chain to the seals, which feed on various fish species and other Antarctic foods.	1	1	2		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	[Album: Stunning Photos of Antarctic Ice]	2	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	The seals had a few advantages over the penguins.	1	2	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	Unlike the emperor penguins, which must traverse the ice to feed, the female seals generally stay put once they haul out at the breeding site.	2	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	The seals may also have benefitted from being farther from B-15 when it broke off the ice shelf, Chambert said.	2	2	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	Chambert and colleagues believe that the drop in reproduction is indicative of seals' strategy for dealing with difficult times.	3	2	2		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	Seals can live up to 30 years, and they breed annually beginning at age 6, meaning if they miss a year or two, they will have a chance again later.	1	2	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	"This is a long-lived species.	1	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	Because of that, you expect a strategy that will favor survival over reproduction," he said.	2	2	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	By putting off reproduction, the seals can spend more energy on survival.	1	2	2		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	This gives them the chance to breed again when conditions are better.	1	2	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	The researchers note the icebergs were only around for a short period.	1	1	1		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	More frequent iceberg calving, such as those predicted as a result of global warming, could have had a more negative effect on the seal population, the researchers write.	3	1	3		4	
47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	The research was published today (Sept.	1	1	1	S	4

53	apnewsbreak-us-surge-troops-afghanistan-233948316	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Nearly two years after President Barack Obama ordered 33,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan to tamp down the escalating Taliban violence, the last of those surge troops have left the country, U.S. officials said Thursday.	2	2	3		4	
53	apnewsbreak-us-surge-troops-afghanistan-233948316	The withdrawal, which leaves 68,000 American forces in the warzone, comes as the security transition to Afghan forces is in trouble, threatened by a spike in so-called insider attacks in which Afghan Army and police troops, or insurgents dressed in their uniforms, have been attacking and killing U.S. and NATO forces.	2	1	4		4	
53	apnewsbreak-us-surge-troops-afghanistan-233948316	And it's called into question the core strategy that relies on NATO troops working shoulder to shoulder with Afghans, training them to take over the security of their own country so the U.S. and its allies can leave at the end of 2014 as planned.	2	1	3		4	
53	apnewsbreak-us-surge-troops-afghanistan-233948316	The number of U.S. forces there peaked at about 101,000 last year, and they have been coming out slowly over the past several months.	1	1	2		4	
53	apnewsbreak-us-surge-troops-afghanistan-233948316	The surge was aimed at beating back the Taliban to give the Afghan government and its security forces the time and space to take hold.	2	1	2		4	
53	apnewsbreak-us-surge-troops-afghanistan-233948316	The key goal was to ensure that the Taliban did not regain a foothold in the country that could allow it once again to become a safe haven for terror groups.	2	2	3		4	
53	apnewsbreak-us-surge-troops-afghanistan-233948316	And there was hope that Taliban members would be willing to come to the peace table.	3	2	2		4	
53	apnewsbreak-us-surge-troops-afghanistan-233948316	Military commanders say the war strategy is on track and that they have made broad gains against the Taliban, wresting control of areas where the insurgents once had strong footholds.	3	3	3		4	
53	apnewsbreak-us-surge-troops-afghanistan-233948316	And U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has characterized the insider attacks as the last gasp of a desperate insurgency.	3	3	2		4

54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	Can you imagine a world where there is no other white meat?	2	1	1		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	If skyrocketing use of the term "aporkalypse" on Twitter is any indication, a recent statement from the United Kingdom's National Pig Association is causing some anxious consumers to do just that.	3	1	2		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	But is the trade group's claim that "a world shortage of pork and bacon next year is now unavoidable" really true?	2	1	2		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	"If you define a shortage as a situation where product cannot be found or where buyers must wait in lines to buy a product, the answer is no," Cindy Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the Des Moines, Iowa-based National Pork Board, told Life's Little Mysteries by email.	2	1	1		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	"But the quantity of pork available to consumers in the U.S. and the rest of the world will decline in 2013, due to high feed costs and significant financial losses by producers."	2	1	2		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	The high feed prices are attributed partly to this year's widespread droughts, which have jacked up corn and soy prices and resulted in half of all U.S. counties being declared disaster areas.	2	1	2		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	Some farmers have tried to cope by feeding candy to livestock.	1	1	1		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	Steve Meyer, a consulting economist to the National Pork Board (whose members are chosen by the U.S. secretary of agriculture), said U.S. pork consumers are likely to see price jumps next year as a result of this year's droughts, as the British trade group claims; however, he says the rise in prices will be slight, and he questions the group's "apocalyptic tone."	3	1	2		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	"There will be less pork, but that's happened before," Meyer told Life's Little Mysteries.	1	1	1		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	"I'd be surprised worldwide if it's more than a 2 or 3 percent decrease on per-capita availability.	3	1	1		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	That number hasn't changed that much in a long time."	3	1	1		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	Meyer notes that global availability of pork has for the most part been on a forward march in recent years.	2	2	1		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	Consumption reached an all-time peak in 2010, at 33.4 pounds (15.1 kilograms) per person, before it decreased to 32.8 pounds (14.8 kg) per person in 2011, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service.	1	1	1		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	That figure is likely to bounce back slightly this year, to 32.94 pounds (14.9 kg), before the economic effects of the drought are fully felt by consumers, according to the USDA.	3	1	1		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	Assuming retail prices do start to reflect the decreasing availability of pork, Meyer says he'd be surprised if they topped $3.75 per pound, or about 25 cents higher than they are now.	3	1	1		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	"If we have good weather next year, I think costs will come down and they [pork producers] will be back in a profitable place at least by 2014," he said.	2	2	1		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	Still, the long-term prospects for current global pork consumption habits may not be good.	2	1	2		4	
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	A recent report from the Stockholm International Water Institute found that in the year 2050, the Earth's water supply will be able to sustain the expected world population of 9 billion people only if humans are deriving just 5 percent of their calories from animal-based foods ?	1	1	2	S	4

56	apple-ceo-apologizes-maps-flaws-recommends-rivals-041424819--sector	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook apologized Friday to customers frustrated with glaring errors in its new Maps service and, in an unusual move for the consumer giant, directed them to rival services such as Google Inc's Maps instead.	3	1	2		4	
56	apple-ceo-apologizes-maps-flaws-recommends-rivals-041424819--sector	The rare apology follows Apple's launch of its own mapping service earlier this month, when it began selling the iPhone 5 and rolled out iOS 6, the highly anticipated update to its mobile software platform.	2	1	1		4	
56	apple-ceo-apologizes-maps-flaws-recommends-rivals-041424819--sector	Users complained that the new Maps service - based on Dutch navigation equipment and digital map maker TomTom NV's data - contained geographical errors and gaps in information, and that it lacked features that made Google Maps so popular from public transit directions to traffic data and street-view pictures.	2	1	2		4	
56	apple-ceo-apologizes-maps-flaws-recommends-rivals-041424819--sector	"We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better," Cook said in a letter to customers released on its website, adding that the company "fell short" of its commitment to deliver "the best experience possible to our customers."	4	1	2		4	
56	apple-ceo-apologizes-maps-flaws-recommends-rivals-041424819--sector	Unusually, he suggested that customers download rival mapping services available in Apple's App Store while the company improves the product.	3	1	1		4	
56	apple-ceo-apologizes-maps-flaws-recommends-rivals-041424819--sector	"While we're improving Maps, you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing, MapQuest and Waze, or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web app," he said in the letter.	2	1	1		4	
56	apple-ceo-apologizes-maps-flaws-recommends-rivals-041424819--sector	Apple is typically loathe to tout rival services and the contrite apology by Cook is an indication of how Apple is changing under the chief executive who took over last year from co-founder Steve Jobs just before his death.	3	1	2		4	
56	apple-ceo-apologizes-maps-flaws-recommends-rivals-041424819--sector	It also took the additional step of prominently displaying the rival services on its Apps Store.	2	1	1		4	
56	apple-ceo-apologizes-maps-flaws-recommends-rivals-041424819--sector	"It is a bit unusual but at the same time, Tim is keeping Apple's commitment to provide the best user experience for customers," Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said.	3	2	1		4

57	apple-downfall-seen-horizon-142022590	Have reports of Apple’s (AAPL) death been greatly exaggerated? Predicting the inevitable demise of the most successful consumer electronics company in the world is something of a pastime for many news outlets. Every leader eventually falls, of course, but predicting how and when is a sure way to attract attention. And so in Wednesday’s edition of The Wall Street Journal, an opinion piece proudly proclaimed that “TV will be Apple’s undoing.”	3	1	3			
57	apple-downfall-seen-horizon-142022590	As noted by Fortune on Thursday, WSJ Columnist Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. believes that Apple is slipping. The Cupertino, California-based company has historically focused on making great products but now, Jenkins opines, Apple is becoming far too focused on strategy. He cites the rejection of Google’s (GOOG) superior Maps app as one example of Apple’s missteps, but the issue will really become apparent when Apple tries to tackle TV.	3	3	3			
57	apple-downfall-seen-horizon-142022590	“Apple’s fans imagine the company can do for TV what it did for music: breaking up the existing distribution model. Forget about it,” Jenkins writes. “Television is about to demonstrate the inadequacy of Apple’s own business model.”	4	2	3			
57	apple-downfall-seen-horizon-142022590	The columnist believes video content owners are not the same breed as music content owners, with whom Apple has seen much success. “Video-content owners aren’t looking for a savior and ultimately won’t be satisfied with anything less than an open ecosystem accessible by any device,” Jenkins says.	4	1	3			
57	apple-downfall-seen-horizon-142022590	He continues, “They’ll have no choice: Content owners already see their business being upended by Netflix and Amazon Instant Video, with an approach adapted to digital ubiquity from the get-go. They also know, if they sit still, their current partners, the cable industry and its analogues, will simply take advantage, as satellite operator DISH is doing with its ad-skipping function that so infuriates the TV networks.”	2	1	2			
57	apple-downfall-seen-horizon-142022590	For Apple to succeed in this space, it will apparently “have to focus more on giving its devices superb access to content it doesn’t control and hasn’t approved,” and Jenkins doesn’t think Apple’s top brass is up to the task.	2	1	2			
57	apple-downfall-seen-horizon-142022590	“The real test will be for senior management,” he writes. “The time to worry will be if Apple’s quixotic quest for TV leads it to block more realistic solutions that emerge on the open Internet. When Apple admits defeat about TV, that may be the best sign for the company’s future.”	2	2	2			
57	apple-downfall-seen-horizon-142022590	Jenkins had previously foreseen the “Microsofting” of Apple when it launched the “junky” iPad 10 years ago. As Fortune notes, Apple has sold more than 100 million iPads since that point in time.	1	1	2

59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	Apple's Cook sorry for Maps errors, suggests rivals	1	1	2		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook apologized Friday to customers frustrated with glaring errors in its new Maps service, and, in an unusual move for the consumer giant, directed them to rival services instead, such as Google Inc's Maps.	2	1	2		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	The rare apology follows Apple's launch of its own mapping service earlier this month, when it began selling the iPhone 5 and rolled out iOS 6, the highly anticipated update to its mobile software platform.	2	1	1		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	Users complained that the new Maps service - based on Dutch navigation equipment and digital map maker TomTom NV's's data - contained geographical errors and gaps in information, and that it lacked features that made Google Maps so popular, including public transit directions, comprehensive traffic data or street view pictures.	1	1	2		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	"We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better," Cook said in a letter to customers released on its website, adding that the company "fell short" of its commitment to deliver "the best experience possible to our customers."	2	1	2		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	He then suggested that customers download rival mapping services available in Apple's App store, while the company improves the product.	1	1	1		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	"While we're improving Maps, you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing, MapQuest and Waze, or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web app," he said in the letter.	1	1	1		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	Apple is typically loathe to tout rival services and the contrite apology by Cook is an indication of how Apple is changing under the chief executive who took over last year from co-founder Steve Jobs just before his death.	3	1	2		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	NEW APPLE				I   	5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	The last time Apple faced such widespread criticism was in 2010, when users complained of signal reception issues on the then-new iPhone 4 model.	1	1	2		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	A defiant Jobs at the time rejected any suggestion the iPhone 4's design was flawed but offered consumers free phone cases at a rare, 90-minute press conference called to address those complaints.	2	2	2		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	While Apple fixed the issue, Jobs had apologized to users only after he was specifically asked if he was sorry.	1	2	2		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	Cook's suggestion that Apple users download other map apps, particularly Google Maps, represents an about-turn for Apple, which had introduced its service as a direct challenge to the popular service offered by ally-turned-rival Google.	3	1	1		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	Apple Maps replaced the Google Maps app, which is no longer available on iOS 6. Users now have to access Google Maps through the browser.	1	1	1		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	Google and Apple were close partners with the original iPhone in 2007 and its inclusion of YouTube and Google Maps.	1	1	1		5	
59	apples-cook-sorry-maps-errors-suggests-rival-services-131606395--finance	But ties between the two companies have been strained by the rise of Google's Android mobile operating system, now the world's leading platform for smartphones.	2	1	2		5

60	apples-iphone-sales-numbers-disappoint-investors-100920965	In the days leading up to the launch, several analysts predicted that Apple would sell roughly twice as many iPhone 5s in the opening weekend as it did with the iPhone 4S last year.	3	3	1		4

60	apples-iphone-sales-numbers-disappoint-investors-100920965	These and other analysts typically pointed out a couple key factors influencing their predictions: buzz for the iPhone 5 had really been building up for about two years, and the fact that Apple rolled out the new iPhone in two more countries than the iPhone 4S.	3	2	1		4	
60	apples-iphone-sales-numbers-disappoint-investors-100920965	More recently, Apple revealed that it received twice as many pre-orders for the iPhone 5 as it did for the iPhone 4S, further fueling speculation of blockbuster iPhone 5 sales.	2	3	1		4	
60	apples-iphone-sales-numbers-disappoint-investors-100920965	As it turned out, Apple still ended up having a record-setting launch, but opening weekend sales of the iPhone 5 were only about one million units higher than the opening weekend sales for the iPhone 4S last year.	2	2	2		4	
60	apples-iphone-sales-numbers-disappoint-investors-100920965	What's more, as Asymco analyst Horace Dediu points out, the iPhone 5 sold at roughly the same rate as the iPhone 4s when you normalize for the number of countries in which the phones were available over opening weekend.	2	2	2		4

61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	When Will Arctic Ice Completely Disappear?	2	1	3		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	The Arctic sea ice just hit its lowest extent since measurements began in the 1970s, raising the question of when Arctic summer sea ice will disappear for good.	2	1	3		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	The answer is not yet clear, thanks to the complex variability of the sea ice from year to year.	2	1	1		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	But scientists say that Arctic ice is one area where their computer models seem to underestimate the rate of melt.	2	1	2		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	"Sea-ice decline is a good example of one of those areas where the projections are too conservative, i.e.	1	2	2	S	4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	where the observed decline is decades ahead of schedule relative to the model projections," Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist, told LiveScience in an email.	1	1	2	S	4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	Sea ice reached its lowest recorded extent on Sunday, Sept. 16, covering only 1.32 million square miles (3.41 million square kilometers) of ocean and blowing past the previous 2007 record of 1.61 square miles (4.17 million square kilometers), according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).	1	1	2		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	Ice extent is measured by the area of ocean that has at least 15 percent ice cover.	1	1	1		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	Unlike icebergs, which break off from glaciers, sea ice forms when ocean water freezes.	1	1	1		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	The loss of the ice will likely exacerbate global warming, as ice cover reflects sunlight away from the Earth, while open ocean absorbs the sun's heat.	2	1	2		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	[10 Crucial Facts About Arctic Sea Ice]	1	1	1		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	Sea ice varies quite a bit each year, said Walt Meier, a research scientist at the NSIDC.	2	1	1		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	Thus, researchers expect to see an overall downward trend in ice cover, but it could bounce back somewhat next year.	2	1	2		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	"We wouldn't expect it to keep going down straight off the map, so to speak," Meier said during a press conference Thursday (Sept.	2	1	2	S	4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	20).	1	1	1	S	4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	"We expect there to be more ups and downs."	2	2	2		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	The most extreme estimates of when Arctic summer ice could vanish peg the time in four or five years, but Meier said those predictions are "very unlikely."	3	1	2		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	Much of the northernmost ice in the Arctic is old and thick, he said, and might be more resistant to melt.	2	2	2		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	If so, summer ice extent could hit a plateau and not disappear for many years.	2	2	1		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	"A lot of people talk potentially in the next 20 to 30 years we may become ice-free," Meier said.	2	1	2		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	"That's certainly quite plausible."	3	1	1		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	The loss of ice so far has been dramatic.	2	1	2		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	In 1980, Arctic sea ice covered approximately the same area as the lower 48 U.S. states, minus Oregon and Washington.	2	1	1		4	
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	In 2012, it would barely cover half the country, with everything east of the Mississippi melted off as well as Oregon, Washington, Kansas, Nebraska and North and South Dakota.	2	1	1		4

71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Mike Lake describes his autistic son Jaden as a "3- or 4-year-old trapped in a 16-year-old body," a boy unable to speak or comprehend emotions.	1	1	3		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	For Jaden, abstract thinking is a challenge and his most direct communication is reaching for his father's face and crying out "bababa" when he needs to be understood.	1	1	3		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	But that "beautiful simplicity" is enough for his dad.	3	2	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"I lay down with him on the bed at night and he looks at me in communication mode," said Lake, 43.	2	2	1		4

71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	He talks along with me at the same time bababa-ing.	2	1	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	It's the strangest thing.	3	1	2		4

71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Since 2006, Lake's world has been Canada's House of Commons, where he delves into the complex political issues of the day as a member of Parliament and secretary to the minister of industry.	3	1	1		4

71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"I didn't get elected to Parliament on the autism issue," said Lake, 42. "But as time has gone by, it's one world.	2	1	1		4

71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	And while research has advanced, particularly in the area of genetics, it is still a puzzle to scientists.	1	2	2		4

71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	But for Jaden, who is on the cusp of adulthood, the future presents mind-boggling challenges.	3	1	3		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	He has no sense of danger and will cross the street unaware of the traffic.	1	1	4		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Once, on the grounds of the House of Commons, he lunged for a German Shepherd security dog, grabbing its neck and going "mouth-to-mouth" with the animal.	1	1	3		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Though he cannot communicate verbally, Jaden is capable of much that might translate into a future vocation: a 130 score in bowling, a job cataloging books at the library and making chocolate chip cookies.	2	2	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"Here is a kid that when you first see him, his skills seem significantly affected, then all of a sudden you see him measuring things out and cooking," said his father.	3	2	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	He is also extraordinarily affectionate, not typical in autistic children.	3	2	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	In a Canadian television interview with his father, ebullient Jaden is a far cry from Dustin Hoffman's character in the film "Rain Man," a robotic autistic adult.	3	2	1		4

71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	But I can honestly say I couldn't be more proud of my boy.	3	3	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	He is always quick with a high-five or a kiss, is never ever a bully, and loves everyone without a hint of judgment.	3	3	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	I think we could all use a little more of that."	2	1	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	As a politician, Lake encourages "every family in North America" to meet their elected officials and educate them on autism.	2	2	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"Bring your loved one with autism, I tell people," he said.	2	2	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"If you can't explain autism because the family member is acting up -- they can explain it better than you ever could."	2	2	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Jaden was diagnosed just before he was 2, but his parents knew there was something wrong before that.	1	1	3		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"He wouldn't respond when calling him and at first we thought he had a hearing problem," said Lake. "Then we realized when he was two floors away and we turned on [the TV show] 'Barney' he came running down."	2	1	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"He was not like a typical kid who once in a while ignores his parents," said Lake. "He would actually come to get us, really as a tool, for something he couldn't reach.	3	2	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	He would push our arms up to the shelf in the pantry where the treat was he wanted."	2	1	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	But Jaden was clever at other things.	1	2	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	He could put foam blocks with letters of the alphabet in order "without hesitation," according to his father.	1	2	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Jaden's grandmother was the first to suspect autism when she read a book written by another mother, "Let Me Hear Your Voice," that described Jaden "perfectly."	2	1	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	All those with autism are different.	1	1	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"You have to be an expert at reading your own child," said Lake. "Jaden is unique -- he wants to talk but he can't.	2	1	3		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Other kids are completely silent."	1	1	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Jaden gets excited about the film, "Sound of Music," Smarties (Canadian M&Ms) and being told concrete plans about the day's schedule.	3	2	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	But he cannot articulate his feelings.	2	1	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"People with autism have a real hard time, even highly functioning people," said Lake. "And they come across as odd -- and have great difficulty in their social lives."	3	1	3		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	So far, in a K to 12 school where Jaden has gone his whole life, his classmates have embraced him.	2	2	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	He has been involved in musical theater, dancing in a production of "Oliver," and this year learning to play an old man, who walks across the stage with a cup.	1	2	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	But Jaden is incapable of telling his parents if he has a stomach ache and when his parents ask him, he might give a meaningless nod.	1	1	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"He wants to make us happy with the answer he gives," said Lake. "His default answer is yes."	3	2	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	They worry about his future, when they are not around to love and care for him, but hope Jaden can contribute with the skills he does possess.	3	2	3		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"We have chosen to focus on what is in front of us," said Lake, not ruling out living or vocational opportunities "that are good for him."	3	1	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Jaden has had intensive interventions -- about 36 hours a week -- since he was 2. He can use the computer to write down "very basic and concrete" words, but his parents have decided that it's more important to interact with him in other ways than to rely on a speech-activated device.	2	2	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Jaden's mother cried when he learned to kiss for the first time at age 11.	3	3	2		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Lake, who worked for 11 years for his hometown ice hockey team, the Edmonton Oilers, said his relationship with Jaden surprises him in some ways.	3	1	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"I am a very competitive person, so the idea of having a child with special needs would have terrified me," he said.	3	2	3		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"I had visions of my son playing in the NHL and graduating with honors.	3	2	1		4	
71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	I look back and I can't imagine loving a kid more than I love Jaden.	3	4	1		4

71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	"I always say that if we could snap our fingers and Jaden wouldn't have autism," said Lake. "We'd miss the Jaden we have now."	3	1	2		4

72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	Now that he's returned to Earth from a five-month stay on the International Space Station, NASA astronaut Joe Acaba is still getting used to life on the ground.	1	2	1			
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	Acaba landed in Kazakhstan Sept. 16 after riding a Russian Soyuz spaceship back to Earth with two cosmonauts, Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin. The three spaceflyers had just finished stints as crewmembers on the Expedition 32 mission of the International Space Station, which orbits Earth 240 miles (386 km) overhead.	1	1	1			
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	"I'm feeling much better, getting used to it, and better and better every day," Acaba told SPACE.com during an interview Wednesday (Sept. 25). "You forget how strong gravity is when you've been gone for a while."	2	3	1			
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	During his tenure in space, Acaba had a hectic schedule of science experiments, space station upkeeping duties, and hosting the occasional robotic cargo-delivery spacecraft. In fact, Acaba was present for the very first visit of a privately-built vehicle, the Dragon capsule built by Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) of Hawthorne, Calif., which docked at the space station May 25.	2	1	2			
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	Dragon delivered a load of food, clothes and supplies as a trial run for a series of 12 delivery hauls the company is contracted for by NASA.	1	2	1			
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	"I was pretty fortunate — I arrived and then four days later, Dragon showed up, and so it was a real busy time for my first part of the increment," Acaba said. "It was very nice to be part of that first docking of a commercial vehicle, and we really enjoyed it, and it was a great milestone." [Video: Joe Acaba Encounters 'The Avengers' and Dragon in Space]	3	4	1			
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	But it wasn't all work and no play in space. Acaba was the mastermind behind the plan to screen the movie "The Avengers" on the space station while he was there. A self-professed comics fan, the astronaut worked with NASA, Marvel Comics and Disney to uplink the film to the orbiting outpost in June.	2	2	1			
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	"It's really nice to have a movie night," Acaba said. "As a crew, we're very integrated. Just like here on Earth, whenever you can get together with family and friends to watch a movie or whatever it may be, it's pretty special, so we enjoyed the movie and we just enjoyed spending time together."	2	3	1			
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	The astronaut gave the movie high grades.	1	3	1			
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	"I thought it was great, but I'm a little biased because I enjoy all the superhero movies, growing up with comics and things like that," he said. "I enjoyed it, and I was very thankful that we were able to get it up there."	3	3	1			
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	Acaba joined NASA in May 2004, and flew to space for the first time on the STS-119 mission of the shuttle Discovery in March 2009. Before becoming an astronaut, Acaba earned a master's degree in geology, and taught in high school and middle school.	1	1	1			
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	"I was a math and science teacher out in Florida, and I think the teaching profession really gets you pretty well qualified to become an astronaut," Acaba said. "It may not seem that way, but schoolteachers every day, they're in a stressful environment, every day is different, and you need to cope with a wide range of people and different experiences."	2	2	2

73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	Avian malaria spreads north into interior Alaska: study	1	1	2		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Malaria is infecting birds as far north as Alaska's interior, and a rapidly warming climate may be the reason the mosquito-borne disease appears to be advancing northward, a new study shows.	1	1	2		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	It is the first time scientists have detected the transmission of avian malaria in local birds at such far-north latitudes anywhere in North America, said the study, published on Wednesday in the scientific journal PLOS One.	1	1	1		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	"We now have shown that malaria is being transmitted in Alaska," said Ravinder Sehgal, a San Francisco State University biologist and a lead researcher on the project.	2	1	1		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	While tropical birds that migrate to Alaska in the summer are known to carry the disease, there had never been any documented cases of it spreading to non-migratory Alaska birds or birds newly hatched in Alaska that had not yet flown south, Sehgal said.	1	1	1		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	Longer periods of warm weather in the summer may be allowing the malaria parasite to thrive in Alaska and be transmitted by mosquitoes, Sehgal said.	1	1	1		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	"The question was, how far north is it getting, and is it going to get to birds that have never expressed it?" he said.	1	1	1		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	The study notes that temperatures have been increasing in the Arctic at almost twice the average global rate, and that the warming climate has changed vegetation in the far north.	1	1	2		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	The study evaluated blood samples taken last year from birds in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Coldfoot, a community north of the Arctic Circle.	1	1	1		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	The researchers found avian malaria in resident and hatch-year birds in Anchorage and Fairbanks, though not as far north as Coldfoot.	1	1	1		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	Of 676 birds tested, 7.2 percent were found to be infected.	1	1	2		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	Some of the hardest-hit birds were black-capped chickadees, Sehgal said.	2	1	2		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	Of the black-capped chickadees tested in Anchorage, about 30 percent were infected.	1	1	2		4	
73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	Further studies are underway to try to determine what type of mosquito might be spreading the disease, Sehgal said.	1	1	2		4

75	bahraini-protesters-police-clash-funeral-205144404	The protesters, mainly from the Shi'ite majority, had demanded a bigger role for elected representatives and less power for the ruling al-Khalifa family, who are Sunni Muslims. Some Shi'ite groups sought an end to the monarchy.	2	2	1

82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	As if the task of competing with Apple’s (AAPL) new iPhone 5 isn’t daunting enough, Samsung (005930) has chosen an interesting approach to promoting its flagship Galaxy S III smartphone in the U.S. that inadvertently brings a new rival into the mix: Facebook (FB). As dominant as Apple is in the mobile industry — the company accounted for 77% of all mobile industry profits last quarter — Facebook is equally in command of the social space. But nevertheless, Samsung’s recent promotional efforts in the U.S. take aim squarely at one of Facebook’s key features.	2	2	1			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	Samsung’s Galaxy S III has definitely found success in North America thus far. Alongside a recent announcement that the flagship smartphone sold 20 million units in its first 100 days of availability, Samsung noted that it sold 4 million units in North America during that time period. While that figure pales in comparison to Apple’s iPhone sales, the Galaxy S III is just one smartphone in Samsung’s arsenal and 4 million units is nothing to scoff at.	2	3	1			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	The handset’s continued success relies on a number of factors, however. Ongoing support from carriers’ in-store sales staff is always important, but marketing and advertising obviously play a huge role in generating consumer awareness and interest.	1	2	1			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	In Samsung’s most recent ad run for the Galaxy S III, the company focuses on one feature in particular. Dubbed “Share Shot,” the nifty function creates a series of Wi-Fi Direct connections that allow users to instantly and automatically share photos they take with their friends who are nearby. The feature requires a Galaxy S III be used on both sides of the connection — sending photos and receiving photos — but it will be included in additional Samsung phones set to launch later this year.	1	1	1			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	Here is one of Samsung’s recent television commercials showcasing the feature:				I		
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	Share Shot can be a bit tricky to set up at first, but in my tests it worked well on Samsung’s Galaxy S III. All else aside, however, the question remains: Is Share Shot the answer to a question no one is asking?	2	2	2			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	Facebook is currently home to nearly 1 billion active users each month, and photo-sharing is one of the monstrous social network’s key features. Users love sharing photos and, perhaps even more so, they love commenting on each other’s photos. How important is photo-sharing to Facebook users? So important that the company decided to spend nearly $1 billion to acquire Instagram and further bolster its photo-sharing portfolio.	1	3	1			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	Now, whether or not Samsung intended to compete with Facebook, Share Shot is direct competition with Facebook’s photo-sharing features and with Instagram. The problem, however, is that while Share Shot is technologically far more advanced than anything Facebook offers, it is far less social.	2	3	2			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	When users share images via Share Shot, each of their nearby friends (who use a compatible device and who have configured the feature) will instantly receive a copy of each image taken on his or her phone. It has been shared. This means that if the user decides to share a photo later using Facebook or Instagram, it is no longer novel for friends who had previously used Share Shot.	1	1	2			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	Photos shared using Share Shot are also only visible to those users in close proximity to the source phone. No other friends can see these photos unless they are re-shared on a more widely available network. Share Shot also doesn’t support commenting — and we all know how much people love to comment on photos — or re-sharing without the use of a third-party app.	1	1	1			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	In the end, Share Shot is a social feature that isn’t very social at all.	2	1	2			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	Share Shot is by no means a useless feature, though. It is an example of an area where Samsung is trying to add value and differentiation, and for some users, it may indeed be compelling. Samsung’s focus on the feature in recent ads is part of a bigger issue, however: Samsung is not always good at telling people why they should buy Samsung phones.	1	2	2			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	Samsung’s recent iPhone 5 attack ad is another perfect example of this. Going on the offensive and telling people why they should choose the Galaxy S III over the iPhone 5 is a fantastic idea. Listing trivial or unknown features like “Shake To Update” and “Palm Touch Mute Pause” as reasons people should buy the Galaxy S III over the iPhone 5, however, is not.	2	2	2			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	Samsung is doing a great job of building phones that carriers want and that consumers want. It sold more than 50 million smartphones into channels last quarter and it had a formula that was really working. But that formula seemed to involve saturating the market with models of all shapes more than it involved creating strong differentiated experiences.	2	4	1			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	In a recent interview, however, Samsung’s marketing boss pointed out that the company is hoping to change that. “Especially in U.S., people are obsessed with Apple,” Samsung’s Younghee Lee said earlier this year. “It’s time to change people’s attention.”	2	2	1			
82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	Samsung is moving in the right direction. Its latest flagship phones like the Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II indeed offer unique features that cannot be found elsewhere. Now, finding a way to communicate the right features to the right audience looks like it will be Samsung’s next big challenge if it hopes to see continued success once carriers’ attention begins to shift elsewhere.	1	2	1

84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The surreptitious video recording of a fundraiser held for Republican Mitt Romney in May provided a rare glimpse of how he views supporters of President Barack Obama - as government dependents.	3	1	3		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	It also provided an equally novel sight of a relaxed Romney doing an impression of Henry Kissinger, dishing about late-night television talk show host David Letterman, and receiving some pointed tips for his presidential campaign.	3	2	2		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	"I saw Dr. Kissinger," Romney says on the video, recounting a meeting in New York with the former U.S. secretary of state.	3	2	1		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	"I said to him, 'How are we perceived around the world?'	3	1	1		4

84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	The secretly filmed recording, released in its entirety by the liberal Mother Jones magazine on Tuesday, opened a window on how Romney acts during the kind of private meeting with donors that is helping to propel the most expensive presidential campaign in U.S. history.	2	2	2		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	In this case the former Massachusetts governor and private equity executive was speaking to donors who paid $50,000 each for the privilege of his company at a private dinner at the Boca Raton, Florida, home of financier Marc Leder.	1	1	1		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	Family and friends often say that Romney, who can be awkward while campaigning, is at ease and funny when the cameras are off— or believed to be.	2	3	1		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	"You're not eating," Romney scolded one attendee during his remarks at the fundraiser.	3	3	1		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	"I'm mesmerized," the donor said.	3	3	1		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	"He's bored to tears," Romney said to laughter.	3	2	1		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	At one point, Romney decided to give the donor a lesson in eating.	3	2	1		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	"You take this, your fork, and you put it in," Romney said.	3	3	1		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	When asked about Democrats' criticisms of his tenure as a wealthy executive at Bain Capital, Romney pretended to plead poverty.	3	2	2		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	"I'm poor as a church mouse," said Romney, who has an estimated fortune of $250 million.	3	2	2		4

84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	Romney also gossiped about CBS late-night talk show host David Letterman, a frequent critic of the Republican.	2	2	2		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	Romney said he preferred Jay Leno, host of NBC's "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno."	3	2	1		4

84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	By coincidence, a few hours after the video's release online, Obama arrived in New York City to tape an interview with Letterman.	2	2	1		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	Romney said he turned down an appearance on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" because visiting the show "has the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential."	3	2	2		4

84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	For most of the video, only the backs of donors' heads can be seen, with Romney in profile.	2	1	1		4	
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	The audio does, however, pick up donors' comments to Romney, including some good-natured ribbing about his image on the campaign trail.	2	2	1		4

85	behind-social-media-campaigns-obama-romney-104608266	As more potential voters turn to the Internet to stay connected -- and less are catching political TV spots -- the need to leverage social media to hit respective audiences has never been greater.	2	1	1		4

88	bernanke-makes-strong-defense-fed-rate-policies-163042949--finance	WASHINGTON (AP) — Chairman Ben Bernanke offered a sharp defense Monday of the Federal Reserve's bold policies to stimulate the weak economy, while cautioning Congress to respect its private discussions.	2	2	2		4	
88	bernanke-makes-strong-defense-fed-rate-policies-163042949--finance	The Fed needs to drive down borrowing rates low because the economy isn't growing fast enough to reduce high unemployment, Bernanke said in a speech to the Indiana Economics Club.	3	1	2		4	
88	bernanke-makes-strong-defense-fed-rate-policies-163042949--finance	The unemployment rate is 8.1 percent.	1	1	1		4	
88	bernanke-makes-strong-defense-fed-rate-policies-163042949--finance	Low rates could help lower the federal budget deficit by reducing the government's borrowing costs and generating more tax revenue through stronger growth, Bernanke said.	2	2	1		4	
88	bernanke-makes-strong-defense-fed-rate-policies-163042949--finance	Bernanke also cautioned Congress against changing the law so it could review the Fed's interest-rate policy discussions.	2	1	1		4	
88	bernanke-makes-strong-defense-fed-rate-policies-163042949--finance	Such a step would improperly inject political pressure into those talks and make Fed policymakers less likely to act, Bernanke warns.	2	1	2		4	
88	bernanke-makes-strong-defense-fed-rate-policies-163042949--finance	The speech comes just weeks after the Fed voted at its Sept. 12-13 meeting to purchase mortgage bonds to help boost the housing market.	1	2	1		4	
88	bernanke-makes-strong-defense-fed-rate-policies-163042949--finance	The Fed left the program open ended, saying that it would keep buying the bonds until the job market showed substantial improvement.	2	2	1		4	
88	bernanke-makes-strong-defense-fed-rate-policies-163042949--finance	The Fed also said at the September meeting it plans to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero through at least mid-2015.	1	1	1		4

89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	New research suggests that beta-blocker pills don't prevent heart attacks, strokes or cardiac deaths in patients with heart disease, but doctors are torn over whether there's enough in the study to make them want to stop prescribing the drugs.	3	1	4		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Beta blockers have been a standard heart medication for decades.	2	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	The study, published in the Journal of American Medical Association, looked at nearly 45,000 patients with prior heart attacks, coronary artery disease or risk factors for coronary artery disease, and found that those on beta blockers didn't show significantly lower rates of heart attack, stroke or cardiac death than those not on the medication.	2	1	3		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	"This is a very compelling study that has the potential to shake up the conventional wisdom that exists regarding the role of beta blockers in the management of patients with cardiovascular disease," said Dr. Randal Thomas, a cardiovascular specialist at the Mayo Clinic.	3	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	"At a minimum, it will lead to new studies that address this issue once again."	3	1	1		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Beta blockers work by blocking adrenalin receptors in the brain that become activated when the body is stressed.	1	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Beta blockers are used to treat heart disease, high blood pressure, anxiety and other conditions.	1	2	3		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Some doctors say they are glad beta blockers are being questioned because their use had been "written in stone" for so many years, but others say using a non-randomized data sample is not as reliable as a randomized drug trial.	3	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	While the authors attempted to account for differences between the patient groups that might have had an impact on their health, they did not have access to information on why some patients were prescribed these drugs and some were not, said Dr. Richard Besser, the chief heath and medical editor at ABC News.	3	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Dr. Melvin Rubenfire, who directs cardiovascular medicine at the University of Michigan, said he'd been hoping for a study like this, but it won't change his prescribing habits because he uses beta blockers only in specific cases.	3	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Rubenfire also weans patients off the pills 18 months after they have a heart attack if they experience adverse side effects, such as fatigue and erectile dysfunction.	2	2	3		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Rubenfire said the existing data wasn't enough to determine which patients would benefit from beta blockers, and what kinds of beta blockers are better than others.	3	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Beta blockers include at least six brand names, including Sectral, Tenormin and Zebeta.	1	1	1		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Even study coauthor Christopher Cannon, a professor at Harvard Medical School, said he will continue to prescribe beta blockers to his patients, adding "I would not make too much of this" because the study is only observational.	2	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	"All it can do is raise up an idea for us researchers to consider for further study," he said.	2	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Cannon said this research shows that it's unclear whether beta blockers add more benefit than the other therapies developed in the decades since beta blockers became a standard of practice for treating patients with heart disease.	3	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Since patients are often taking several drugs, it's hard to pinpoint how much one agent helps compared with another.	2	1	1		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Dr. Steven Nissen, who chairs the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, said the medicine might not be ideal for all of the patients it's prescribed to, but a new randomized, controlled trial will be necessary to change guidelines for prescribing beta blockers.	2	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	"Abandonment of this type of therapy for post-MI [post-heart attack] patients based upon an observational study is not warranted," he said.	3	2	2		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	For the time being, the study raises questions, said Dr. Harlan Kumhulz, a professor of medicine, epidemiology and public health at Yale University.	3	1	3		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	"The question it raises is about how long after having a heart attack should patients remain on beta blockers?"	3	1	3		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	Kumhulz said, noting that beta-blocker patients didn't have better outcomes than the other patients did after the first year.	3	1	3		4	
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	"The study cannot definitively answer that question -- but raises doubts about the need to continue to take them for the rest of a patient's life."	3	1	2		4

94	bodies-moved-kenya-mass-graves-police-suspect-102953458	MOMBASA (Reuters) - Bodies may have been moved from mass graves in Kenya to prevent an investigation into a suspected slaughter of villagers during inter-tribal unrest in the Tana River region, police said.	1	1	3		4	
94	bodies-moved-kenya-mass-graves-police-suspect-102953458	The suspected graves were found on Monday in Kilelengwani village, the focus of fighting in the coastal area that has killed more than 100 people in the past three weeks, including nine police officers.	1	1	4		4	
94	bodies-moved-kenya-mass-graves-police-suspect-102953458	The scale of the unrest has left many Kenyans convinced it was politically instigated and has raised fears of serious tribal fighting before elections due in March.	2	1	2		4

94	bodies-moved-kenya-mass-graves-police-suspect-102953458	Those who removed the bodies must have been striving to hide some evidence," he said by telephone late on Thursday.	3	1	2		4	
94	bodies-moved-kenya-mass-graves-police-suspect-102953458	"It is possible that the graves might have been tampered with and bodies removed before police arrived at the scene to seal it off," Adoli said.	2	1	2		4	
94	bodies-moved-kenya-mass-graves-police-suspect-102953458	Raiders shot, hacked and burnt to death 38 people last week in Kilelengwani and 20 people have been arrested and charged with murder over the killings.	1	1	4		4

95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	LONDON (Reuters) - A Bank of England scheme to give lenders cheap funding will boost credit supply to the recession-hit economy as the majority of Britain's big banks have signed up, central banker Paul Fisher said on Tuesday.	2	2	3		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	The rate-setter also sounded a note of cautious optimism about the European Central Bank's recent steps to calm the euro zone debt crisis, though he urged European governments to use the opportunity to find a lasting fix to the crisis, which the BoE sees as one of the main drags on the British economy.	2	2	4		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	Britain's government and central bank started the new scheme in August, hoping to remove one of the obstacles to economic recovery by offering cheap funds to lower banks' funding costs.	2	2	3		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	"I am confident that the FLS (Funding for Lending Scheme) will help the supply of credit," Fisher said in a speech.	2	2	2		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	"Before its introduction, it was more likely than not that the stock of credit would contract further over the next 18 months."	2	2	1		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	Fisher said that 13 lenders had signed up for the scheme, representing 73 percent of the stock of lending to households and companies, as of the end of June.	2	1	1		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	A significant number of other institutions were close to signing up too, he added.	2	1	1		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	Under the scheme, banks and building societies can borrow up to 5 percent of their stock of existing lending from the BoE, plus any expansion of its lending during the period between the end of June and the end of 2013.	1	1	1		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	With some 1.2 trillion pounds of lending to firms and households on their books, the banks currently participating could tap a total of around 60 billion pounds in cheap funds, compared to some 80 billion if all banks took part.	1	1	1		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	It may take banks a while to fully review their lending plans, and drawings on the scheme will likely be spread out over the full time frame to the end of 2013, Fisher said.	2	2	1		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	The BoE will provide details about banks' use of the scheme on December 3.	1	1	1		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	Fisher said five of Britain's six largest banks had signed up for the scheme.	2	1	1		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	HSBC said right at the start it did not want to participate as it preferred to fund lending through customer deposits.	2	1	1		4

95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	A lack of credit is one of the obstacles to recovery for the economy, which has been slowly moving out of recession over recent months.	2	1	2		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	Some BoE policymakers have indicated that they believe the funding for lending scheme could be a better way to get a recovery going than further purchases of government bonds with newly created money.	2	2	2		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	Most economists still expect another dose of quantitative easing asset buys once the current 50 billion-pound round is completed in November.	2	2	2		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	"Should the FLS succeed in boosting aggregate demand, then pressure on the MPC to relax policy will wane," Barclays analyst Chris Crowe said in a note.	2	2	2		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	However, Crowe was sceptical about the overall impact of the scheme.	2	1	3		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	"We do not think that banks will substantially relax lending standards to promote new lending," he said.	2	1	2		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	Previous schemes to spur lending since the financial crisis have failed to give a clear boost to the economy.	2	1	3		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	The government has also launched a state-backed business bank to provide more loans to smaller companies.	1	2	1		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	The British Bankers' Association (BBA) said that lending to consumers and businesses fell again on the year in August.	2	1	2		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	"Over time, the Funding for Lending Scheme will improve lending conditions, though it is too early to measure any impact yet," the BBA said, adding that the weakness in the economy may well be the reason why companies were reluctant to borrow.	2	1	2		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	The BoE has said the cost of loans and tighter credit conditions are a major reason for the lack of lending, blaming the euro zone debt crisis for a rise in banks' funding costs.	2	1	3		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	The ECB's recent decision to buy bonds from countries like Italy and Spain had improved market sentiment, Fisher said.	2	2	2		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	"I would caution, however, that we have been here before," he said.	3	1	3		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	"Along with every other market participant I hope that this time will be different."	3	1	2		4	
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	Politicians now had to use the time provided by the central bank's action to take the necessary steps such as improving the competitiveness of southern European countries, he said.	2	1	2		4

100	bradley-mickelson-become-ryder-cup-rock-stars-200326976--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - The Ryder Cup has seen many great partnerships but never one quite like Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley, who have turned a May-September bromance into golf's dynamic duo.	2	3	1		3	
100	bradley-mickelson-become-ryder-cup-rock-stars-200326976--golf	Bradley, a fiery rookie and Mickelson, the most experienced member of the American brigade making his ninth appearance at the biennial competition, have developed the type of chemistry rarely seen on a U.S. Ryder Cup team.	2	2	1		3	
100	bradley-mickelson-become-ryder-cup-rock-stars-200326976--golf	With three wins from three matches at stately Medinah Country Club, Mickelson and Bradley have become Ryder Cup rock stars whipping the massive galleries into a frenzy with every high-five and fist-pump.	2	2	1		3

100	bradley-mickelson-become-ryder-cup-rock-stars-200326976--golf	Britons Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood managed six victories out of nine matches and Scotsman Colin Montgomerie and German Bernhard Langer five wins from seven.	1	3	1		3	
100	bradley-mickelson-become-ryder-cup-rock-stars-200326976--golf	But the U.S. has never really come close to developing an iconic partnership, Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson were the most successful American pairing, manufacturing five wins from five matches while Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson were 4-0 together.	1	2	2		3	
100	bradley-mickelson-become-ryder-cup-rock-stars-200326976--golf	"Well, certainly not on the American side," Mickelson told reporters when asked if the Americans had ever had two players so invested in each other.	2	1	1		3

100	bradley-mickelson-become-ryder-cup-rock-stars-200326976--golf	Bradley and Mickelson then flexed their muscles in Saturday's foursomes with a record equaling 7&6 thrashing of Britons Lee Westwood and Donald to the thundering approval of the pro-American crowd.	2	3	1		3

100	bradley-mickelson-become-ryder-cup-rock-stars-200326976--golf	With 40 PGA Tour wins, including four majors, Mickelson has always been rated as one of the game's best but has never found anyone capable of bringing out his creativity in Ryder Cup competition, which was reflected in his 11-17-6 record coming into Medinah.					3

103	brent-crude-slips-below-112-global-worries-weigh-060409174--finance	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Brent crude fell below $112 per barrel on Monday, reflecting investor concerns a shaky global economy may hurt oil demand following fresh evidence of weakness in China and Japan as well as persistent worries about the debt-saddled euro zone.	2	1	2		4	
103	brent-crude-slips-below-112-global-worries-weigh-060409174--finance	The drop, also fueled by a stronger dollar, comes after the crude benchmark closed out the third quarter with its biggest three-month gain in 1-1/2 years, buoyed by supply risks in the Middle East and efforts among global central banks to stimulate flagging economies.	1	2	2		4

105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	The brightest exploding star ever seen with the naked eye in recorded history apparently experienced a quick and lonely death, a new study reveals.	3	2	2		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	The discovery, which centered on a star explosion witnessed in the year 1006, suggests that many similar outbursts leave no companion star to accompany their demise.	1	1	2		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	The most powerful exploding stars in the universeare supernovas, which are bright enough to momentarily outshine their entire galaxies.	1	2	1		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	One type of star explosion, known as a Type 1a supernova, occurs when one star pours enough fuel onto a dying companion star known as a white dwarf to trigger an extraordinary nuclear explosion.	1	2	1		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	The new study centered its sights on the supernova SN 1006, which was seen all over Earth in the spring of 1006 above the southern horizon of the night sky, in the constellation Lupus, just south of Scorpio.	1	1	1		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	At its peak, researchers say the supernova, which exploded about 7,100 light-years away, was about one-quarter the brightness of the moon, luminous enough that people could have read by its light at midnight.	1	2	1		3

105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	Our sun and more than 90 percent of all stars in our galaxy will one day end up as white dwarfs, which are made up of their dim, fading cores.	1	1	2		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	There are two ways Type 1a supernovas are born — the slow way, which involves a living star dumping gas onto a white dwarf, and the fast way, where two white dwarves merge catastrophically.	1	2	2		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	The slow route would leave the white dwarf's companion behind, while the fast one would effectively blast away discernible traces of either white dwarf.	1	1	1		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	Whether slow origins of Type 1a supernovas were more commonplace than fast ones or vice versa remained a puzzle.	1	1	2		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	Knowing more about the causes behind these explosions is essential because Type 1a supernovas are key to gauging the rate at which the universe is expanding, which in turn could shed light on why this expansion is apparently accelerating due to a mysterious force called dark energy.	2	1	2		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	Scientists have tried looking for companion stars of Type 1a supernovas before.	1	1	1		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	One possible instance was Tycho's supernova, SN 1572, one of the few supernovas visible to the naked eye in historical records, although that case remains questioned.	3	1	2		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	Now a fruitless search for a companion star to the brightest supernova ever seen with the naked eye on Earth suggests this explosion took the fast route.	3	1	2		3

105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	Using data from the Paranal Observatory in Chile, the researchers combed through the space 16.5 light-years in diameter around SN 1006 and "do not find any star in the surroundings of the supernova remnant to be the possible companion of the progenitor of SN 1006," lead study author Jonay González Hernández, an astrophysicist at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands in Spain, told SPACE.com.	1	1	2		3	
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	When combined with previous results, these findings suggest less than 20 percent of Type 1a supernovas apparently occur via the slow route.	1	1	1		3

107	bskyb-warner-bros-sign-uk-film-deal-160459202	LONDON (Reuters) - BSkyB has signed a deal for the right to screen new Warner Bros films on Sky Movies channels and video-on-demand services, tightening its grip on British pay-TV little more than a month after a regulator cleared it of unfairly dominating the British market.	2	1	2		5	
107	bskyb-warner-bros-sign-uk-film-deal-160459202	Under the deal, announced on Wednesday and spanning five years, subscribers to Sky Movies and customers of NOW TV, an internet service powered by Sky, will have access to Warner releases about six months after they end their cinema runs.	1	1	1		5	
107	bskyb-warner-bros-sign-uk-film-deal-160459202	The films, including blockbusters such as Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and Batman sequel The Dark Knight Rises, will then be available exclusively on Sky Movies for more than a year.	1	1	1		5	
107	bskyb-warner-bros-sign-uk-film-deal-160459202	Customers will also have access to older Warner Bros titles, such as The Matrix franchise and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.	1	1	1		5	
107	bskyb-warner-bros-sign-uk-film-deal-160459202	The deal means that Sky continues to enjoy exclusive UK rights to new releases from all six major Hollywood studios.	1	1	1		5	
107	bskyb-warner-bros-sign-uk-film-deal-160459202	Rivals complain that the satellite broadcaster's dominance of the British market restricts competition and leads to higher prices.	1	1	2		5	
107	bskyb-warner-bros-sign-uk-film-deal-160459202	Last month the Competition Commission ruled that BSkyB's position in movies did not adversely affect Britain's pay-TV retail market, saying that new arrivals Lovefilm and Netflix had increased customer choice.	1	2	1		5

108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	BERLIN (AP) — An ancient Buddhist statue that a Nazi expedition brought back from Tibet shortly before World War II was carved from a meteorite that crashed on Earth thousands of years ago.	1	1	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	What sounds like an Indiana Jones movie plot appears to have actually taken place, according to European researchers publishing in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science this month.	2	2	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	Elmar Buchner of the University of Stuttgart said Thursday the statue was brought to Germany by the Schaefer expedition.	1	1	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	The Nazi-backed venture set out for Tibet in 1938 in part to trace the origins of the Aryan race — a cornerstone of the Nazis' racist ideology.	1	1	2		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	The existence of the 10.6-kilogram (23.4-pound) statue, known as "iron man," was only revealed in 2007 when its owner died and it came up for auction, Buchner told The Associated Press.	2	1	2		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	German and Austrian scientists were able to get permission from its new owner, who wasn't disclosed, to conduct a chemical analysis that shows the statue came from the Chinga meteorite, which crashed in the area of what is now the Russian and Mongolian border around 15,000 years ago.	1	2	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	The meteorite was officially discovered in 1913, but Buchner said the statue could be 1,000 years old and represent a Buddhist god called Vaisravana.	1	1	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	The Nazis were probably attracted to it by a left-facing swastika symbol on its front.	1	1	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	The swastika has been used by various cultures throughout the ages, but the Nazis tried to appropriate it as the symbol of their ideology, going so far as to put a right-facing version of it on their red and white flag.	2	1	2		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	Scientists not involved in the study told the AP that the research linking the statue to the meteorite was credible.	1	2	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	"Looks like a solid piece of geochemical 'forensic' work," said Qing-Zhu Yin, a researcher in geology at the University of California, Davis.	2	2	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	"No terrestrial artifact would generally contain that much nickel content.	1	2	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	Chemical elements don't lie."	2	1	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	Rhian Jones, an associate professor at the University of New Mexico who specializes in meteorites, said the claim appeared conclusive.	2	2	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	"There is a clear and convincing argument that the meteorite the statue is made from is the Chinga iron meteorite," she said.	2	2	1		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	But Yin cast doubt on the claim that the statue represented a Buddhist deity.	2	1	2		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	"I am not a historian.	1	1	2		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	But the 'iron man' does not look like a Buddha to me from my cultural background," he said.	2	1	2		4	
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	"It looks more like a warrior with a sword ... (a) resemblance of Genghis Khan.	1	1	1		4

109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	(AP) — Dozens of people, some wearing red "Save Our Jobs" T-shirts, packed a public meeting on Thursday to testify that a key component of California's landmark greenhouse gas emissions law will impose enormous costs on them and consumers.	3	1	3		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	Manufacturers, oil refiners and others appeared before the California Air Resources Board to protest the state's pending cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions.	1	1	3		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	The program's fees amount to a $1 billion-a-year tax increase at a time when the state's economy is sputtering, they said.	3	1	3		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	"We are concerned that out-of-state refiners will have an unfair advantage because they are not being held responsible for their emissions," said Lisa Bowman, a Phillips 66 worker and member of United Steelworkers Local 675.	3	1	3		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	The California Chamber of Commerce and others wrote Gov. Jerry Brown urging him to halt the start of the program, which begins in earnest on Nov. 14 and is the central element of California's 2006 climate-change law, AB32.	3	1	3		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	A key issue for those opposed to the program is costs associated with the permits — called allowances — which the program will require businesses to buy, some at auction.	3	1	3		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	In general, cap-and-trade will place a limit, or cap, of the emissions of heat-trapping gases that are allowed from pollution producers like refineries and cement manufacturers.	2	2	1		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	The businesses will be required to buy these allowances from the state, with each permit allowing for a specified amount of greenhouse gases each year.	1	1	1		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	For the first two years of the program, businesses will receive 90 percent of their allowances for free, with the free amount and the cap declining over time.	1	1	1		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	The chamber and other businesses want the amount of free allowances increased to reduce the impact on their businesses in a struggling economy.	2	1	3		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	"The fact is that this auction represents a multi-billion dollar hidden tax that will harm California businesses and consumers by dramatically increasing energy costs at a time we can least afford it," the letter to the governor stated.	3	1	4		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	Business groups say the uncertainty about what costs associated with cap-and-trade will be in 2015 — when the number of free allowances are set to be reduced — are influencing investment decisions being made now.	3	1	3		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	They want assurance that those costs will be lowered by offering more free allowances.	3	2	3		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	"We need to send the message now ... that more allowances will be available to industry," said Dorothy Rothrock of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association.	3	2	2		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	"2015 is right around the corner and manufacturers are making plans this year for the next three-to-five years and capital investments may or may not happen in California based on the current regulations."	3	1	2		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	The board has designed the system to financially reward businesses that reduce emissions below their cap — meaning money could be made through cap and trade.	2	2	1		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	Companies that cut emissions and have extra allowances can then sell the permits in a marketplace; greenhouse gas emitters could purchase those allowances if they failed to cut emissions.	2	2	2		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	Polluters that reduce emissions could turn a profit if the market price for extra allowances rises above the initial cost of the permit.	2	2	2		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	"This system rewards those that are more efficient and allows those who can't or don't want to reduce their emissions too keep on operating and pass the cost of allowances on to their customers," Mary Nichols, the board's chairman, said.	3	3	1		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	A company can also meet up to 8 percent of its emissions reduction obligations by purchasing carbon "offsets," or investments in forestry or other projects that reduce greenhouse gases.	2	2	1		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	The program, the largest in the U.S., is modeled on similar programs in Europe, and designed to be able to link up with plans in other states and elsewhere to increase the size of its market for carbon allowance trading.	2	2	1		4	
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	"(The board) has gone a long way to make these regulations as simple and palatable as possible," Nichols said.	3	3	1		4

110	cabrera-homer-helps-tigers-close-white-sox-044904950--mlb	Ace pitcher Justin Verlander tossed six scoreless innings to make it an easy night at home for the Tigers (79-69) as they pulled within two games of first place Chicago (81-67), who lost 3-0 at Kansas City.	2	3	2			
110	cabrera-homer-helps-tigers-close-white-sox-044904950--mlb	Cabrera's bid to become the first man to lead the league in batting, home runs and RBIs since Boston's Carl Yastrzemski in 1967 is becoming a gripping subplot to the league-wide race for the playoffs.	2	2	1			
110	cabrera-homer-helps-tigers-close-white-sox-044904950--mlb	The Venezuelan infielder, already pacing the AL in hitting (.333) and RBIs (130), blasted his 41st home run to put him one behind leader Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers with just 14 games remaining.	2	2	1			
110	cabrera-homer-helps-tigers-close-white-sox-044904950--mlb	"It's amazing," Cabrera told reporters. "I feel very good right now, I'm trying to see my pitches and go out there and battle. (But) we have to focus on winning games right now."	3	4	1

111	calculate-2013-facebook-ad-spend-free-tool-090331761	Aiming to take some of the mystery out of calculating ad spending on Facebook, social media marketing firm Syncapse has introduced a free online tool that lets brand managers do the math.	2	2	1		4	
111	calculate-2013-facebook-ad-spend-free-tool-090331761	The tool, which went live Thursday morning, takes into account multiple variables that would affect such spending, including target market, market conditions and interests.	1	1	1		4

111	calculate-2013-facebook-ad-spend-free-tool-090331761	In a hypothetical example with a very broad target, Syncapse's calculator recommended that Kraft Foods' Oreo brand spend $27.6 million communicating with existing fans next year and $103 million going after friends of fans. Here's how it got to that number:	1	1	1		4	
111	calculate-2013-facebook-ad-spend-free-tool-090331761	First, the calculator asks for the size of your target market. You can also specify interests. Facebook has a database of 8 million or so such interests, which can range from celebrities (Martha Stewart) to sports (mountain biking) to TV shows (The Walking Dead.) In this case, no interest was specified:	1	1	1		4

111	calculate-2013-facebook-ad-spend-free-tool-090331761	Scissons acknowledges that the online tool provides a ballpark estimate of spending and that various factors, including Facebook's steady stream of new advertising products, can't be anticipated. However, Scissons says his firm created the tool to illustrate that Facebook is more a platform for CRM than traditional marketing. "There are a lot of agencies on the market that are trying to buy cheap fans," Scissons says. "We're trying to educate the market that they should be thinking of reach and frequency."	1	1	2		4	
111	calculate-2013-facebook-ad-spend-free-tool-090331761	In the near future, Scissons believes, marketers will begin to think of "frequency" as the new advertising and will bank more on exposure via social media than would-be viral campaigns as a driver of purchases. For example, a woman who is interested in Coach handbags may be a Facebook fan, but she may not be interested in "engaging" with the brand on Facebook very much. However, if she's exposed to the right amount of messaging at the right frequency, eventually the brand will reach her when she's in the market for a handbag.	1	2	1		4	
111	calculate-2013-facebook-ad-spend-free-tool-090331761	If Scissons is right and marketers begin thinking about social media marketing as CRM, we'll see fewer out-of-the-box creative campaigns, but marketers may be happier overall with the results.	1	2	1		4

112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	LOS ANGELES (AP) — The California man behind a crudely produced anti-Islamic video posted to YouTube that has inflamed parts of the Middle East was arrested for violating terms of his probation, authorities said Thursday.	1	1	2		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, 55, was convicted in 2010 for federal check and sentenced to 21 months in prison. Under terms of his probation, he was not allowed to use computers or the Internet for five years without approval from his probation officer.	1	1	2		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	Nakoula was arrested after federal probation officials determined he violated the terms of his supervised release, said Thomas Mrozek U.S. Attorney's spokesman in Los Angeles.	1	1	2		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	A U.S. District Court hearing was scheduled for Nakoula on Thursday afternoon. It was closed to media and the public.	1	1	1		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	Protests have erupted around the Middle East over a 14-minute trailer for "Innocence of Muslims," which depicts Muhammad as a womanizer, religious fraud and child molester. Though the trailer was posted to YouTube in July, the violence didn't break out until Sept. 11 and has spread since, killing dozens.	1	1	3		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	Nakoula, a Christian originally from Egypt, went into hiding after he was identified as the man behind the trailer.	1	1	2		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	The full story about Nakoula and the video still isn't known.	1	1	1		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	The movie was made last year by a man who called himself Sam Bacile. After the violence erupted, a man who identified himself as Bacile called media outlets including The Associated Press, took credit for the film and said it was meant to portray the truth about Muhammad and Islam, which he called a cancer.	1	1	2		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	The next day, the AP determined there was no Bacile and linked the identity to Nakoula, a former gas station owner with a drug conviction and a history of using aliases. Federal authorities later confirmed there was no Bacile and that Nakoula was behind the movie.	1	1	2		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	Before going into hiding, Nakoula acknowledged to the AP he was involved with the film, but said he only worked on logistics and management.	1	1	2		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	A film permit listed Media for Christ, a Los Angeles-area charity run by other Egyptian Christians, as the production company. Most of the film was made at the charity's headquarters. Steve Klein, an insurance agent in Hemet and outspoken Muslim critic, has said he was a consultant and promoter for the film.	1	2	1		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	The trailer still can be found on YouTube. The Obama administration asked Google, YouTube's parent, to take down the video but the company has refused, saying it did not violate its content standards.	1	1	2		4	
112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	Meantime, a number of actors and workers on the film have come forward to say they were duped. They say they were hired for a film titled "Desert Warrior" and there was no mention of Islam or Muhammad in the script. Those references were dubbed in after filming was completed.	1	1	2		4

113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's David Cameron backed a senior minister accused of ranting at policemen in public and calling them "plebs", an old-fashioned insult laden with snobbery that has undermined his party's attempts to shake off its privileged image.	1	2	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	The tirade outside the prime minister's Downing Street office by Andrew Mitchell has embarrassed a Conservative party that is trailing in the polls and struggling to shore up its support at a time of recession, tax increases and spending cuts.	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	While reports that Mitchell called the officers "morons" were embarrassing, more damaging was the report that he used the word "pleb", a term that is rarely used by a middle or working class person but is soaked in upper class condescension.	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	The row played into the hands of Conservative critics who think Cameron's centre-right party is run by a rich, lofty group whose policies do little for the majority of voters feeling the pressure of its austerity policies.	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	Many senior Conservatives are millionaires, educated at Britain's top fee-paying schools and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.	1	1	1		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	Rivals mock them as out-of-touch "toffs", the sort of derogatory term that is politically toxic in class-obsessed Britain. A Conservative politician described Cameron and chancellor George Osborne as "arrogant posh boys" in April.	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	Cameron's spokesman said on Monday it was time to draw a line under the affair after Mitchell apologised again to police, even while denying using the words attributed to him.	1	2	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	"He has acknowledged that that behaviour was unacceptable and the apology has been accepted," the spokesman said. He would not be drawn on Mitchell's choice of words or whether he was accusing the police of not telling the truth.	1	2	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	"Pleb" is derived from a Latin word denoting people outside the aristocratic class in ancient Rome, for example shopkeepers, skilled or unskilled workers and farmers.	1	1	1		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	"It is old-fashioned language, it is private language. In public it is pretty awful," Peter York, the author and social commentator, told Reuters. "You certainly wouldn't expect any politician to utter it in a remotely public place."	2	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	A leaked police report in the top selling Sun newspaper on Monday said Mitchell had lost his temper when police officers refused to open the main Downing Street gates to allow him to cycle through last Wednesday evening.	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	BADLY TIMED TIRADE	1	1	1		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	When they asked him to use a pedestrian gate, the report said Mitchell erupted: "Best you learn your fucking place. You don't run this fucking government. You're fucking plebs."	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	The timing could not have been worse, coming a day after two unarmed policewomen were killed in a gun and grenade attack in Manchester, northern England.	2	1	3		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	The Conservatives, who have run Britain in a coalition since 2010, are behind the opposition Labour Party before a 2015 election and the Mitchell row could cut further into their public support if it lingers, analysts said.	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	"They have been remarkably unsuccessful at killing this story," said John Curtice, politics professor at Strathclyde University in Scotland. "That's certainly a problem."	2	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	Mitchell, 56, was educated at the prestigious Rugby School, home of one of the most famous literary bullies, Flashman, in the 19th-century novel "Tom Brown's Schooldays" by Thomas Hughes, an Oxford graduate.	1	1	1		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	Labour leader Ed Miliband, who also went to Oxford, compared Cameron to Flashman last year for his behaviour in parliament.	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	Mitchell went on to Cambridge University and served in the British Army before joining the Lazard investment bank and working for a management consultancy. Cameron gave him the job of "chief whip", or party enforcer, earlier this month.	1	1	1		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	Mitchell said he "did not use the words that have been attributed to me", but repeatedly refused to confirm what he did say during an incident dubbed "Gate-gate" by wags on Twitter.	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	"It had been the end of a long and extremely frustrating day - not that that is any excuse at all for what happened," Mitchell told reporters in the rain outside his office near Downing Street. "I didn't show the police the amount of respect I should have done."	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	Labour and police groups called for an inquiry into the events at Downing Street.	1	1	1		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	Although still unconfirmed, the bad language has fed into a perceptions the Conservatives have not shed the "Nasty Party" tag that dogged them under Margaret Thatcher and John Major in the 1980s and 1990s. Cameron has attempted to soften their policies in areas like gay rights and support for the poor.	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	"There is this perception that ... they are posh, rich people who are out of touch with the lives of ordinary people," said Wyn Grant, politics professor at Warwick University.	1	1	2		4	
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	"But if the government stands firm on this, it may simply just go away."	1	1	2		4

114	canada-august-inflation-slows-slightly-1-2-percent-123201300--business	Statscan analysts said the more precise August figure was 1.24 percent and had been rounded down to 1.2 percent.	1	1	1		4

The visceral visuals, shot in 3-D by Oscar-winning "Slumdog Millionaire" cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, feature extreme close-ups and sequences of super-cool slow-motion photography, which wisely are spread sparingly throughout the course of the picture.	2	3	1		4

117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	(For the uninitiated, Dredd is actually much funnier than this description makes him sound; his terse, deadpan responses to the most absurd and depraved situations provoke the biggest laughs.)	3	2	2		4	
117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	Olivia Thirlby has a calm yet confident presence as the rookie Judge Anderson, who happens to have been assigned to Dredd for training upon one particularly bloody day.	3	2	2		4	
117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	Her psychic abilities make her an asset when things get especially chaotic, and her slightly ethereal nature provides a nice complement to Dredd's intense groundedness.	2	3	2		4	
117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	Dredd and Anderson respond to a triple homicide at the Peach Trees housing complex, a 200-story ghetto ruled by the ruthless prostitute-turned-drug-lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).	2	2	3		4	
117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	When they take one of her lieutenants (Wood Harris) into custody, Ma-Ma puts the whole place on lockdown and insists she'll keep it that way until the judges are killed.	2	2	3		4

117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	You've also seen the found-footage movie a million times before, beginning with the precedent-setting "Blair Witch Project" in 1999 and again in recent years following the success of the low-budget 2007 horror film "Paranormal Activity."	2	1	2		4	
117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	''End of Watch" combines these two approaches: It's a racially mismatched buddy cop movie in which the cops record their daily activities while on patrol, from mercilessly teasing each other in the squad car between calls to tracking bad guys through the dangerous streets and narrow alleyways of South Central Los Angeles.	3	1	4		4	
117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	But admittedly, the found-footage aesthetic infuses the film with both intimacy and vibrancy; it creates the illusion that what we're watching is unscripted, and so we feel like we don't know what's going to happen from one moment to the next.	3	3	1		4	
117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	And co-stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena have such tremendous chemistry with each other, they make you want to ride alongside them all day, despite the many perils in store.	3	3	1		4	
117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	As they insistently goof on each other in often hilarious fashion, their banter reveals not just an obvious and believable brotherly bond but also the kind of gallows humor necessary to make the horrors of their profession tolerable.	2	3	3		4	
117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	After responding to a series of seemingly random calls successfully, the partners find themselves the targets of a stereotypically vicious Mexican street gang, which may have even more dangerous ties south of the border.	3	2	3		4

117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	It's anchored by strong performances on two ends of the acting spectrum: from Logan Lerman as Charlie, the high-school freshman of the film's title whose reserved nature can't hide his obvious intelligence and sweetness, and from Ezra Miller in a showy turn as Patrick, the quick-witted and gay senior-class clown who takes Patrick under his wing.	2	3	1		4

118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Student athletes collapsing from cardiac arrest in the middle of a game may grab headlines, but when someone's heart gives up at a school, it's usually not a youngster's.	1	1	2		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	In a new five-year study, researchers from Michigan found that only two out of 47 cardiac arrests at K-12 schools occurred during sports events.	1	1	2		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	In fact, as many as a third of cases happened after 5 pm and mostly in adults.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	"Schools are community-gathering places, and two-thirds of our cases were adults," said Dr. Robert Swor, an emergency physician at Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	His findings, based on registries and interviews with bystanders and school officials across the country, show that fewer than two out of every 1,000 cardiac arrests overall happen at K-12 schools.	1	1	2		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	Sixteen of the 47 cardiac arrests at schools involved minors.	1	1	2		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	Still, Swor told Reuters Health, "these are high-profile events individually.	2	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	Every time something happens in a school like this it gets a lot of community awareness."	2	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	After looking at how often cardiac arrests happen in schools, and who are the most frequent victims, Swor and his colleagues conclude more attention to emergency response capabilities and preparedness in schools is needed.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	Several states require schools to have automated external defibrillators, or AEDs, on site to treat cardiac arrests.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	The briefcase-sized devices let non-experts check a person's heart rhythm via patches glued to the chest.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	If the heart is beating too fast - known as ventricular tachycardia - to pump out enough blood, or just quivering chaotically in so-called ventricular fibrillation, the AED can jolt it back to its normal rhythm.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	Just last week, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed legislation making AEDs and cardiac emergency plans a requirement at all schools in the state.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	Swor's team, whose results were published in the journal Resuscitation, was able to interview people at 30 of the 47 schools they located.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	It turned out that 19 had AEDs.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	When the AED had been used, four out of 11 people survived until they were discharged from the hospital.	1	2	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	When the device hadn't been used, the survival rate was two out of eight.	1	1	2		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	"It confirms that if you put the AED on you are in good shape, because we are talking about a 50-percent survival," said Dr. Myron Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University, who has studied AEDs but was not involved in the new work.	1	2	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	About 300,000 Americans suffer cardiac arrest every year and fewer than eight in 100 leave the hospital alive.	1	1	3		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	AEDs, which are placed in airports and many other public areas, may save nearly 500 lives every year, according to a study by Weisfeldt and colleagues from 2010.	1	2	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	The devices can be bought for less than $2,000 and are easy for laypeople to use.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	Swor said it appeared that when they weren't used, it was often because bystanders had trouble identifying the signs of a cardiac arrest - for instance because the victim was convulsing or still gasping.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	When in doubt, he added, the AED should always be used because it won't deliver any shocks unless it detects a specific heart rhythm disturbance.	1	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	Both Swor and Weisfeldt called for drills in schools to teach staff and students the signs of cardiac arrest, as well as how to give chest compressions and use an AED - and of course, call 911.	2	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	"We have fire drills, we have tornado drills," said Swor.	2	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	Cardiac arrests "are not common, but they are certainly more common than a school being hit by a tornado."	2	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	Weisfeldt added that seizing the chance to teach students CPR is not only helpful while they're in school, but might pay off down the road if they ever witness a cardiac arrest.	2	1	1		3	
118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	"It's a teachable moment," he said.	2	1	1		3

119	cardinals-beat-eagles-27-6-231846665--spt	Kolb was sharp, hitting 17 of 24 passes, and Arizona (3-0) sacked Vick five times for its best start since 1974, more than a dozen years before the team moved to the desert.	2	2	1		4	
119	cardinals-beat-eagles-27-6-231846665--spt	The Cardinals also have won seven straight home games, the second-longest streak in franchise history.	1	2	1		4	
119	cardinals-beat-eagles-27-6-231846665--spt	Larry Fitzgerald was the guest conductor for the fall opening of the Phoenix Symphony on Thursday and kept the high notes going against the Eagles, catching nine passes for 114 yards and a touchdown while becoming the youngest player to reach 700 receptions.				i	4

119	cardinals-beat-eagles-27-6-231846665--spt	The Eagles didn't give themselves a chance to rally for another victory, picked apart by the quarterback they cast away and hounded by Arizona's attacking defense.	3	1	1		4

119	cardinals-beat-eagles-27-6-231846665--spt	He completed all three of his throws on Arizona's opening drive to set up Jay Feely's 16th straight field goal, from 47 yards.	1	2	1		4	
119	cardinals-beat-eagles-27-6-231846665--spt	After the Cardinals recovered a fumble by Eagles punt returner Damaris Johnson, Kolb threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Michael Floyd, who made his first NFL catch a memorable one by juggling the ball through two Philadelphia defenders.	1	1	1		4

121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Presidential candidate Henrique Capriles is mobbed at rallies by ecstatic women who press close to touch him and leave scratches on his arms and neck.	1	1	3		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Some shout "Marry me!" to the single 40-year-old who's trying to unseat President Hugo Chavez in next month's hotly contested vote.	1	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	The 58-year-old Chavez campaigns as the living legend who for more than 13 years has remade this oil-rich country in his socialistic vision.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	But he's also adjusting his approach as he confronts for the first time a younger, charismatic rival.	1	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	The two are taking at times contrasting approaches ahead of Venezuela's Oct. 7 election but they're aiming for the same pool of swing voters made up of Venezuelans under 30 and women of all social classes.	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	While recent polls show everything from a tie to a double-digit lead for Chavez, they've also revealed between 10 and 20 percent of voters who are either undecided or won't say whom they support.	1	2	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Most of those — about 1.5 million of them — are working-class voters who will play a crucial role in the election, said Angel Alvarez, a professor of political science at Venezuela's Central University.	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	To try to persuade them, Chavez and his campaign have been using "the threat that Henrique Capriles has a package of secret economic measures that are going to seriously affect them," Alvarez said.	1	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"As for Capriles' side, I'd say the strategy is to show that Chavez's government has performed badly in a range of areas from crime to jobs," Alvarez said.	1	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"Who will win?	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	The one that manages to convince those voters... that his adversary is the more dangerous one."	1	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Capriles is also betting on his youthful appeal.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	He's campaigned vigorously in more than 200 towns nationwide, pumping hands and sweating among the crowds.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	The opposition-aligned organization Voto Joven, or Youth Vote, estimates that more than a third of registered voters are between the ages of 18 and 25, making them a key target for both camps.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	As the response at campaign events show, Capriles' appeal to women has become another asset, turning the lean, athletic candidate into a kind of opposition sex symbol.	3	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	On the stump, Capriles has argued that he would inject a fresh voice into politics and replace a bloated administration that's run out of ideas.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	He also tries to reassure Venezuelans that he won't take away the social programs started by Chavez and will manage a peaceful transition of power.	1	3	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"I ask each Venezuelan to reflect deeply, put your hand on your heart and think if it can be better, and think if after 14 years, whether the one who didn't come through is going to do it in the next six years," Capriles told supporters at a rally on Monday.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"Think about it, young people, women."	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Chavez, for his part, faces a challenge rare in electoral politics: trying to appear fresh while seeking a third presidential term that would extend his time in office to two decades.	2	2	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	First, Chavez has tried to erase doubts about his health after more than a year of cancer treatment.	1	2	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	He's shown up on television singing and dancing, even at times slinging an electric bass guitar over his shoulder and pretending to play to the beat.	2	3	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Nonetheless, he's appeared at fewer rallies and has at times looked noticeably bloated and aged.	3	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	He's also gone to great lengths to freshen up his image for younger voters.	3	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Instead of his military fatigues, he's been wearing casual blue jackets and occasionally a yellow scarf.	2	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"Who's the candidate of the future?" the president shouted to thousands of supporters during a speech outside Caracas.	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"Chavez!"	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Singing with a band, the president then belted out the lyrics to his campaign jingle: "Chavez, heart of the people!"	2	3	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	On the streets of Caracas, young supporters have painted cartoon-like murals depicting Chavez as a rapper with tattoos, a basketball player and a motorcycle-taxi driver — images apparently geared at making him seem cool to voters who've grown up during his presidency.	3	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Jacqueline Faria, a leading Chavez campaign official, said the murals simply reflect the love Chavez enjoys from Venezuela's youth.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"The president has youth, youth exuding from every pore," she said.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	The president has also wielded a tougher message, telling voters in speeches that he stands for stability while his opponent represents "chaos" and would do away with the government's popular social programs.	1	2	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"It would be a true fright, a civil war in Venezuela," Chavez said during a Sept. 11 news conference of a Capriles win.	1	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"With our great victory, we are going to continue leaving behind the horror."	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Capriles has said he wouldn't touch the government's programs and would improve what he said was their poorly administration.	1	2	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Chavez has also unleashed scathing rhetoric to paint Capriles as a protector of the wealthy "bourgeoisie," calling his ilk "fascists" and "neo-Nazis."	1	1	3		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Last week, Capriles was forced to boot a top aide from his campaign after the lawmaker was caught on video accepting a purported bribe.	2	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	The grainy video has been replayed for days on state television since the scandal erupted.	2	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Violence has also broken out at campaign events, including a rock-throwing clash before a Capriles rally last week in which police said at least 14 people were hurt.	2	1	3		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	In his speeches, Capriles has avoided name-calling, referring to his adversary as "the government's candidate" while chiding him for talking much and doing little.	1	1	3		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	However, he has accused Chavez of lying about the government's achievements and neglecting the country's oil industry, infrastructure and agriculture.	1	1	3		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"They're importing everything: rice, coffee, beef, milk," Capriles said in a speech this week.	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	He also pointed to dramatically higher murder rates and said that in this vote, "We're going to make a life-and-death decision."	1	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	With Capriles focusing on such concrete issues, Chavez "has no choice but to be doubly aggressive," said Alfredo Keller, a Venezuelan pollster and political consultant who says he isn't working for either side.	2	1	3		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Trying to hone their strategies, both candidates have reportedly turned to experienced campaign consultants for advice.	2	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Venezuelans newspapers have reported that Chavez hired Brazilian consultant Joao Santana, who ran the campaigns of Brazilian presidents Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Faria said she was unable to confirm the reports and that others in charge of the campaign "have sought out his advisers."	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Armando Briquet, Capriles' campaign manager, confirmed that Brazilian campaign consultants Renato Pereira and Francisco Chico Mendez, relative political newcomers, have advised the campaign on some issues.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Briquet said, however, that the opposition leader's strategy has been homegrown and focused largely on "opening up spaces for feelings, for people to feel free to express themselves."	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Judging from the frenzy at Capriles rallies, the approach is working, especially among his women fans.	2	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"I hugged him!	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	I hugged him!" shouted housewife Andreina Delgado, trembling with excitement after throwing herself at Capriles amid a crowd of supporters in the rural town of Mamporal.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"He's our president," Delgado said, on the verge of tears.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"Look at me.	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	I'm overcome with emotion."	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Chavez has responded by trying to tie Capriles to the past, recently asking at a campaign rally, "Who's the candidate of the coup plotters of April?" referring to the 2002 putsch that briefly ousted Chavez.	2	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	He followed with "Who's the candidate of the people?	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	Who's the candidate of the homeland?"	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	With a slower Chavez, however, Capriles' house-to-house campaigning can't help but conjure memories of another young, charismatic politician who crisscrossed the nation before he first won the presidency in 1998.	1	2	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	This year, the president has had to campaign against that very image of himself.	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"To win there has to be a deep emotional connection," Capriles said in an interview on his campaign bus.	1	1	1		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	"I think the government's candidate has worn out his.	1	1	2		3	
121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	He doesn't project that energy, that spark."	1	1	2		3

123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	LOS ANGELES (AP) — A chef who boiled his wife's body for four days to hide evidence of her death was convicted of second-degree murder Thursday.	1	1	4			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	In a recorded interrogation presented by prosecutors during the trial, David Viens, 49, can be heard saying he cooked the body of his 39-year-old wife, Dawn, in late 2009 until little was left but her skull.	2	1	5			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	The chef spoke to authorities from a hospital bed in March 2011 after leaping off an 80-foot cliff in Rancho Palos Verdes.	1	1	3			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	Authorities say he jumped after learning he was a suspect in her disappearance	1	1	3			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	The trial relied heavily on recorded interviews with authorities in which the chef acknowledged the crime in detail.	2	1	2			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	"I just slowly cooked it and I ended up cooking her for four days," Viens could be heard saying on the recording.	4	1	5			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	Viens, who attended his trial in a wheelchair, said in the interview that he stuffed his wife's body in a 55-gallon drum of boiling water and kept it submerged with weights.	1	1	5			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	He said he mixed what remained after four days with other waste, dumping some of it in a grease pit at his restaurant in Lomita, and putting the rest in the trash.	1	1	3			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	He said he stashed his wife's skull in his mother's attic in Torrance.	1	1	3			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	But a search of the house turned up nothing, nor did an excavation of the restaurant.	1	1	1			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	On the recording played in court, Viens was asked what happened on Oct. 18, 2009, the night his wife disappeared.	1	1	1			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	He said he had noticed money missing from his restaurant and suspected his wife.	1	1	2			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	They got into an argument, he said, and he forced her onto the floor where he wrapped her up and put a piece of duct tape over her mouth before going to bed.	1	1	4			
123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	He awoke to find her dead and panicked, he said.	2	1	4

124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Chemist in Mass. lab scandal could see new charges	2	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	BOSTON (AP) — A chemist accused of lying about drug samples she tested at a state lab could face additional charges as prosecutors and defense attorneys sift through thousands of criminal cases that could be upended by her actions.	1	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Annie Dookhan, 34, of Franklin, was arrested Friday in a burgeoning investigation that has already led to the shutdown of the lab, the resignation of the state's public health commissioner and the release of more than a dozen drug defendants.	1	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Many more defendants are expected to be released.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Authorities say more than 1,100 inmates are serving time in cases in which Dookhan was the primary or secondary chemist.	1	1				
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	"Annie Dookhan's alleged actions corrupted the integrity of the entire criminal justice system," state Attorney General Martha Coakley said during a news conference after Dookhan's arrest.	2	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	"There are many victims as a result of this."	2	1	3			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Dookhan faces more than 20 years in prison on charges of obstruction of justice and falsely pretending to hold a degree from a college or university.	1	1	3			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	She testified under oath that she holds a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts, but school officials say they have no record of her receiving an advanced degree or taking graduate courses there.	1	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	State police say Dookhan tested more than 60,000 drug samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the Hinton State Laboratory Institute in Boston.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Defense lawyers and prosecutors are scrambling to figure out how to deal with the fallout.	2	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Assistant Attorney General John Verner called the charges against Dookhan "preliminary" and said a "much broader" investigation is being conducted.	2	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Verner said state police learned of Dookhan's alleged actions in July after they interviewed a chemist at the lab who said he had observed "many irregularities" in Dookhan's work.	2	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Verner said Dookhan later acknowledged to state police that she sometimes would take 15 to 25 samples and instead of testing them all, she would test only five of them, then list them all as positive.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	She said that sometimes, if a sample tested negative, she would take known cocaine from another sample and add it to the negative sample to make it test positive for cocaine, Verner said.	2	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Dookhan pleaded not guilty and was later released on $10,000 bail.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	She was ordered to turn over her passport, submit to GPS monitoring, and not have contact with any former or current employees of the lab.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Dookhan's relatives and attorney declined to comment after the brief hearing in Boston Municipal Court.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Her next court date is Dec. 3.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	The obstruction charges accuse Dookhan of lying about drug samples she analyzed at the lab in March 2011 for a Suffolk County case, and for testifying under oath in August 2010 that she had an advanced degree from the University of Massachusetts, Attorney General Martha Coakley said at a news conference.	1	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	In one of the cases, Boston police had tested a substance as negative for cocaine, but when Dookhan tested it, she reported it as positive.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Investigators later retested the cample and it came back negative, Verner said.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	The only motive authorities have found so far is that Dookhan wanted to be seen as a good worker, Coakley said.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	According to a state police report in August, Dookhan said she just wanted to get the work done and never meant to hurt anyone.	1	2	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	"I screwed up big-time," she is quoted as saying.	3	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	"I messed up bad; it's my fault.	3	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	I don't want the lab to get in trouble."	3	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Dookhan's supervisors have faced harsh criticism for not removing her from lab duties after suspicions about her were first raised by her co-workers and for not alerting prosecutors and police.	1	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	However, Coakley said, there is no indication so far of criminal activity by anyone else at the lab.	2	2	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Co-workers began expressing concern about Dookhan's work habits several years ago, but her supervisors allowed her to continue working.	1	2	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Dookhan was the most productive chemist in the lab, routinely testing more than 500 samples a month, while others tested 50 to 150.	1	2	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	One co-worker told state police he never saw Dookhan in front of a microscope.	2	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	A lab employee saw Dookhan weighing drug samples without doing a balance check on her scale.	2	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	In an interview with state police late last month, Dookhan acknowledged faking test results for two to three years.	1	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	She told police she identified some drug samples as narcotics simply by looking at them instead of testing them, a process known as dry labbing.	2	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	She also said she forged the initials of colleagues and deliberately turned a negative sample into a positive for narcotics a few times.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	"I hope the system isn't treating the evidence against her the way she treated the evidence against several thousand defendants," said defense attorney John T. Martin, who has a client who was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea based on concerns over Dookhan's work.	2	2	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	Dookhan was suspended from lab duties after getting caught forging a colleague's initials on paperwork in June 2011.	1	1	2			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	She resigned in March as the Department of Public Health investigated.	1	1	1			
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	The lab was run by the department until July 1, when state police took over as part of a state budget directive.	1	1	1

125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	RICHMOND, California (Reuters) - Chevron Corp needs a few more weeks to assess damage at its plant in Richmond, California, and does not yet know how long it will need to repair its crude unit after an early August fire damaged the state's second-biggest refinery, its general manager said on Monday.				i	3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	The 245,000 barrels-per-day plant, which accounts for one-eighth of California's refining capacity, has run at a "reduced" rate since the fire, and this has risen only marginally since then, General Manager Nigel Hearne said in an interview.	2	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	The lower throughput caused a jump in gasoline prices in California as traders scrambled to find alternative supplies.	2	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	The crude unit shutdown has left California, which consumes more gasoline than any other U.S. state, vulnerable to price spikes when any of the state's 15 refineries have problems.	1	1	2		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	The cause of the fire is also of great concern for the people living near the refinery.	2	1	3		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	While investigations are still under way, the focus has centered on a failed pipe component less than 5 feet long.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	More than 200 residents gathered in a Richmond auditorium on Monday night to ask questions of the various regulatory bodies investigating the fire.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	Chemical Safety Board investigator Steve Cutchen said sections of the wall of the pipe had thinned to 20 percent of its design, and called the accident a "close call" that "could have been far worse."	3	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	Chevron said this pipe had a low-silicon content, making it more susceptible to corrosion, which was understood by its technical staff but not acted upon.	2	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	"Clearly it wasn't, so the question is why wasn't it," Hearne said in the interview.	3	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	PLANT STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION				i	3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	Chevron found that, in a scheduled maintenance in November 2011, the 200 feet of piping in question had been inspected in 19 different locations, but not the component that failed.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	Asked how long the plant would be down, Hearne said assessments of the damage would need to be completed in the "next few weeks" to establish the timeline for repairs.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	"We're still in the process of fully inspecting the plant," he said, including every individual component in carbon steel systems exposed to the same "high-temperature sulfidation corrosion" that it believes affected the pipe.	2	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	Full access to the refinery had just been opened up by investigators.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	Analysts had expected repairs to the refinery's crude distillation unit, known as Crude Unit No. 4, to take between 3 months and 6 months.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	The hydrocarbons being processed at the plant were being provided by both the market and Chevron's other U.S. refineries, he added.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	The Richmond refinery, Chevron's oldest, opened 110 years ago.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	On Sunday, the San Francisco Chronicle reported the plant was being investigated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over a 3-inch (7.6-centimeter) pipe that let emissions bypass pollution control equipment.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	An EPA representative told the meeting on Monday that he could not give any timeline on that investigation, which is not related to the fire.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	Hearne said the pipe was not a deliberate design, and had been in place before the implementation of monitoring of flaring at the refinery.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	Chevron advised air quality regulators of the pipe three years ago, and had reviewed the rest of the refinery to make sure there were no similar lines elsewhere.	1	1	1		3	
125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	But Loni Hancock, the California state senator for the local area, summed up the exasperation of many residents about the 3-inch pipe when she told the meeting on Monday night: "Whether inadvertent or deliberate, there's got to be a way to ensure that never happens again."				i	3

127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	BEIJING (Reuters) - China's ruling Communist Party accused disgraced politician Bo Xilai of abusing power, taking huge bribes and other crimes on Friday, sealing the fate of a controversial leader whose fall shook a leadership handover due at a congress from November 8.	2	2	3			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	The once high-flying Bo now faces a criminal investigation that stemmed from a murder scandal, and will almost certainly be jailed.	3	1	3			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	With the Communist Party congress about six weeks away, further steps in the case could come before then, helping pave the way for a transition of power, experts said.	2	2	1			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	"Bo Xilai's actions created grave repercussions and did massive harm to the reputation of the party and state, producing an extremely malign effect at home and abroad," the official statement from a party leaders' meeting said, according to a report by the official Xinhua news agency.	2	1	3			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	Bo's wife Gu Kailai and his former police chief Wang Lijun have already been jailed over the scandal stemming from the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood in the southwestern municipality of Chongqing, where Bo was Communist Party chief.	1	1	3			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	The official statement carried by Xinhua said that in the murder scandal, Bo "abused his powers of office, committed serious errors and bears a major responsibility".	2	1	3			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	That charge appears to reflect accusations from Wang's trial that suggested Bo tried to stymie the murder investigation.	3	1	3			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	Reports that Bo, the "princeling" son of a revolutionary leader, could escape with a light punishment have now been dealt a fatal blow, and accusations of womanizing could further tarnish his reputation in the eyes of Chinese people.	2	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	But the few weeks left before the congress will probably not allow time for a trial, said He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University who has closely followed Bo's downfall.	2	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	"I think it's quite certain that he won't be able to escape punishment under the criminal law, but the timing makes it unlikely that will happen before the congress," said He.	3	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	"I'd guess that he'll get a jail sentence of 20 years or longer.	3	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	The death penalty is unlikely, although the bribery charges could in theory allow it, if the amount is as huge as they say."	2	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	At the congress, Chinese President Hu Jintao will step down as party chief, almost certainly making way for Vice President Xi Jinping to emerge as top leader.	3	1	1			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	Xi is then almost sure to be appointed state president at the annual parliament session, likely in March next year.	3	1	1

127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	Bogu is his wife's official but rarely used surname.	1	1	1			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	Bo's "grave violations of party discipline" extended back to his time as an official in Dalian city and Liaoning province in northeast China, and as minister of commerce, said the statement from the Politburo.	2	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	"Party organizations at all levels must use the case of Bo Xilai's grave disciplinary violations as a negative example," it said.	2	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	Bo's son, Bo Guagua, who was a friend of the murdered Heywood, has remained largely silent throughout the fall of his parents.	2	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	He appears to be still in the United States, after finishing graduate studies at Harvard University.	3	1	1			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	Since Bo Xilai was ousted in March, he has not been seen in public and has not been allowed to answer the accusations against him.	1	1	1			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	At a news conference days before his removal, Bo rejected as "filth" and "nonsense" the then unspecified allegations against him and his family.	2	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	At the same time as announcing the slate of accusations against Bo, the party set the November 8 date for the congress that will unveil the country's new central leadership line-up.	1	1	1

127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	Bo, 63, was widely seen as pursuing a powerful spot in the new political line-up before his career unraveled after his former police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to a U.S. consulate for more than 24 hours in February and alleged that Bo's wife Gu had poisoned Heywood to death.	2	1	3			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	After his appointment as party chief of Chongqing in 2007, Bo, a former commerce minister, turned it into a showcase of revolution-inspired "red" culture and his policies for egalitarian, state-led growth.	1	1	1			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	He also won national attention with a crackdown on organized crime.	1	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	His brash self-promotion irked some leaders.	2	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	But his populist ways and crime clean-up were welcomed by many of Chongqing's 30 million residents, as well as others who hoped that Bo could take his leftist-shaded policies nationwide.	2	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	His likely trial could still stir that ideological contention.	2	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	China's party-run courts rarely find in favor of defendants, especially in politically-sensitive cases.	2	1	2			
127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	After state television announced the charges against Bo, some leftist sympathizers insisted that he was the innocent victim of a political plot.	2	1	2

128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese government pressed ahead on Saturday with an effort to discredit fallen politician Bo Xilai, drawing an outcry from leftist supporters of the former leadership contender in a sign of the rifts that his prosecution could inflame.	3	1	3		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	Once a charismatic yet divisive star who stood out on China's stolid political stage, Bo is almost sure to face trial and jail eventually after the ruling Communist Party announced his expulsion on Friday and issued a list of sordid allegations: bending the law to hush up a murder, taking huge bribes, and engaging in "improper sexual relations with multiple women."	3	2	4		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	The party issued the damning accusations at the same time that it announced a November 8 for a congress that will anoint a new generation of top leaders - a lineup that Bo held barely disguised ambitions to join.	2	1	3		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	Bo's downfall has unsteadied preparations for that leadership succession, and exposed revelations of high-level abuse of power after his former police chief briefly took refuge in a United States consulate and exposed allegations that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, murdered a British businessman.	3	1	4		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	State media tried to draw a clear line between Bo and the party elite he once belonged to, casting his fall as a victory for the party's determination to fight corruption.	2	2	2		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	"No matter how high a position, no matter how influential, anyone who violates party discipline and state law will be sternly pursued and punished," said a commentary on the case issued by the official Xinhua news agency.	3	2	2		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	"As a senior party official, Bo Xilai should have been a model of obedience to party discipline," it said.	3	2	2		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	"But instead he monopolized power and behaved recklessly, doing as he pleased and gravely violating discipline," added the commentary, which was widely distributed by state media websites.	3	1	3		4

128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	The party could face trouble, however, convincing skeptics that it has only recently awoken to Bo's crimes, which it traced way back to his years as a city official in northeast China.	3	1	3		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	Bo's leftist supporters have already revived charges that Bo is the victim of a plot to eradicate him and his populist policies.	2	2	2		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	"Last night, one of the core members of the ruling party's leadership was suddenly turned into a demon," said one commentary on "Red China", a far-left Chinese-language website that has issued a torrent of commentary defending Bo.	3	2	2		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	"Unlike other ousted senior officials, Bo Xilai's downfall has triggered two diametrically opposed reactions in society - one of elation and relief, and the other of outrage and regret."	3	3	3		4

128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	But China's version of Twitter, "Weibo", has also echoed with debate about Bo's dramatic downfall.	2	1	2		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	Public support for Bo is unlikely to creep into the heavily regimented party congress, but the effort to disgrace him could foster deeper public disillusionment with the party by showing that one of its formerly favored officials was steeped in corruption.	3	1	3		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	Bo, 63, is the "princeling" son of a Communist Party official who served alongside Mao Zedong.	2	1	1		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	"He won support from the underdogs of society and the radical intellectuals, and maybe even some within the party and the military," said Lai Hongyi, who teaches about contemporary China at the University of Nottingham in Britain.	3	3	2		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	"That's probably quite polarizing because you are not talking about just a few people but a segment of the whole of Chinese society and the establishment."	3	2	2		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	After arriving in Chongqing in 2007, Bo turned it into a showcase for pro-growth economics, and ran a campaign against organized crime, policies welcomed by many of the city's 30 million residents, though his brash self-promotion irked some leaders in Beijing.	2	3	2		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	Bo's wife Gu Kailai and his former police chief Wang Lijun have already been jailed over the scandal stemming from the murder in November of British businessman Neil Heywood.	2	1	4		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	The official statement carried by Xinhua said that in the murder scandal, Bo "abused his powers of office, committed serious errors and bears a major responsibility."	3	1	4		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	That charge appears to reflect accusations from Wang's trial that suggested Bo tried to stymie the murder investigation.	2	1	3		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	The government also accused Bo of taking huge bribes and other unspecified crimes.	3	1	4		4	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	Before Bo is charged and tried, investigators must first complete an inquiry and indict him, but China's prosecutors and courts come under party control and are most unlikely to challenge the accusations.	3	1	3		4

129	china-trade-minister-visit-canada-could-mention-cnooc-182419431--finance	OTTAWA (Reuters) - Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming will visit Canada next week as Ottawa deliberates whether to approve a landmark $15.1 billion takeover of oil producer Nexen Inc by state-owned Chinese oil company CNOOC Ltd.	2	1	1		4	
129	china-trade-minister-visit-canada-could-mention-cnooc-182419431--finance	CNOOC said it did not expect Chen to raise the sensitive takeover bid during talks with the Canadian government.	2	1	1		4	
129	china-trade-minister-visit-canada-could-mention-cnooc-182419431--finance	Canada China Business Council president Peter Harder, however, said he would not be surprised if Chen mentioned it in a speech to his group next Tuesday.	2	1	1		4	
129	china-trade-minister-visit-canada-could-mention-cnooc-182419431--finance	Although Canada is seeking substantial foreign investment in its oil and gas industry, the CNOOC move is raising concern inside cabinet, where some members are wary of letting a Chinese state-owned enterprise buy up domestic assets.	2	1	2		4	
129	china-trade-minister-visit-canada-could-mention-cnooc-182419431--finance	Industry ministry officials are looking closely at the bid to determine whether it is of net benefit to Canada.	1	1	1		4	
129	china-trade-minister-visit-canada-could-mention-cnooc-182419431--finance	Separately, Canada's spy service said some foreign state-owned enterprises could pose a threat to national security.	1	1	2		4

129	china-trade-minister-visit-canada-could-mention-cnooc-182419431--finance	Nexen - whose shareholders voted to accept the CNOOC deal on Thursday - said it was unaware of Chen's visit.	1	1	1		4	
129	china-trade-minister-visit-canada-could-mention-cnooc-182419431--finance	A spokesman for CNOOC said it did not expect Chen and Fast to discuss the bid "because this is transaction between two commercial companies, not a government to government affair".	1	1	1		4

129	china-trade-minister-visit-canada-could-mention-cnooc-182419431--finance	"I think he would express the view that the transaction should be looked at as a business transaction and be seen on its merits and that China would hope that that would be the case," he told Reuters in a phone interview.	2	1	1		4	
129	china-trade-minister-visit-canada-could-mention-cnooc-182419431--finance	Harder said that in Chen's Beijing speech last week, he had mentioned a foreign investment promotion and protection agreement signed by Canada and China this month as well as China's willingness to broaden economic relations between the two countries.	1	2	1		4

130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	"The only constant in life is change."	2	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	That may be true, in general, but it is not always so when it comes to working out.	2	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	Most of us stick to what we know when it comes to exercise.	2	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	You know, our comfort zone, the standard 45 minutes of machine cardio, the three-day splits for weights.	2	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	We like it because we know what to do, how long it will take, and we assume that the repetition will yield gains (or reductions, depending on goals).	3	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	Alas, we are wrong.	2	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	Science now shows the body is much more adaptable to routines.	1	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	That means that the body starts working less hard asap because it is designed to conserve energy.	1	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	When that happens, it stops tearing muscle fibers and burning calories, results diminish, and we start having diminishing returns on our efforts.	1	1	2		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	But, there is good news!	2	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	The way to defeat this is often not by doing more, but by doing less - in terms of duration, anyway.	1	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	Turns out, when the body tries something new, the learning curve makes it fire and burn more, yielding quicker results.	1	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	We also know that using whole body moves and routines, increase yield even more so.	1	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	Add to that, the data suggesting that interval work (alternating spikes and rest periods during cardio or lifting) actually send the body on a fat-burning-frenzy lasting hours after the workout ends.	1	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	So, you can get more out of a workout in less time, and the benefits will last much longer than your typical workout.	1	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	Sounds too good to be true.	2	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	I thought so too, until I tried it out.	4	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	For Men's Health Magazine, I started trying new routines every month or so to see if I could accelerate gains, while also cutting down in the length and frequency of workouts.	3	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	And it worked!	1	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	As long as you keep your body guessing (read: try new stuff every so often) you will out gain the person who is plodding through the same old cardio and weight slog.	2	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	Out of the box I tried a Thai-boxing workout, not because I wanted to get my ass beat, but because I wanted to whup my ass into shape.	4	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	The mix of dynamic cardio, striking, and sparring was new and challenging and it worked.	1	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	As a guy who already had a solid base of muscle and fitness, I saw my body change from the new routine.	3	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	Stronger core, less fat.	1	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	Here is the story.	1	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	The theory worked so well that we started shooting video of my often painful introductions to "what's next."	2	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	The first clip was really outside the box for me.	3	1	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	I went a benefit and there was a dance recital, and I was ready for a good nap, when these big, ripped guys, who resembled NFL defensive backs in leotards came bounding on stage.	4	1	1		4

130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	Upper-body power comes from traditional weight work, but those springs and abs got some extra work: the Horton Technique, their daily 45-minute "length is strength" routine that emphasizes all the assistive muscles in the legs.	1	1	1		4

130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	The best proof: Sims has not suffered an injury in 15 years of performances.	1	2	1		4	
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	Guys out there probably wince at the idea of doing stretching as a repetitive part of a workout, but in four weeks, I had more definition in my legs, a "stronger for longer" core, more lunge power and spring on the court - not to mention I could get all my fingers on the floor when stretching hammys.				i	4

131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	LONDON (Reuters) - Christie's will offer 50 items of James Bond memorabilia over the coming week in a charity sale that culminates in a live auction next Friday, the 50th anniversary of the release of the first 007 movie "Dr. No".	1	2	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	The auction, which will raise funds for a range of charities including UNICEF, is one of a series of events being held around the world to mark the anniversary of one of the world's longest-running and most successful film franchises.	3	3	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	Fifty lots will be up for sale, many of them coming from EON Productions, the company behind the movie series.	1	1	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	Of the total, 40 will be sold online between September 28 and October 8 and 10 of the star items have been reserved for the live auction on October 5, "Global James Bond Day", at Christie's offices in South Kensington in London.	1	1	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	All lots will go on public display there from Saturday until October 4. Admittance is free.	1	2	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	"I think what we wanted to do was to celebrate the 50th anniversary in a meaningful way and let people have the opportunity to buy some of the things in our archive that we could raise money for charity from," said Michael G. Wilson, who along with Barbara Broccoli is guardian of the Bond films.	1	2	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	"There's a lot of things ... from 1,000 pounds ($1,600) on up, really," he told Reuters. "There's plenty of things for a whole range of collectors."	2	1	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	Among the highlights for him was a one-third scale model of an Aston Martin DB5 used in the filming of "Skyfall", the next Bond adventure which hits the screens in October.	1	1	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	The car was used in earlier Bonds and has become closely associated with the fictional double agent.	1	1	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	"In Skyfall we go back to the old Aston Martin, the DB5, we bring that out of mothball," Wilson said.	1	1	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	"We used it in the film but we had to make a model of it. We made an extra model, one third scale ... that was made for the film and I think that's a pretty unique thing to get."	2	1	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	The model is expected to fetch 30-40,000 pounds, while another Aston Martin built in 2008 and used in the opening sequence of the last Bond movie "Quantum of Solace" has a price tag of 100-150,000 pounds.	2	1	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	There is also a special edition of Bollinger champagne on offer for 10-15,000 pounds.	1	1	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	"Can you imagine, a champagne that comes out in an edition of 12 only?" Wilson said.	2	1	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	He added that Bond producers had been working with a number of charities for some time, although their ties to UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, were particularly close through the involvement of former Bond actor Roger Moore.	2	2	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	Among the smaller items being sold are 10 tarot cards used by Jane Seymour playing the character Solitaire in "Live and Let Die" and a belt with a golden bullet buckle worn by Christopher Lee as Scaramanga in "The Man With the Golden Gun".	1	1	1			
131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	"With memorabilia offered from every official Bond film ever made, the auction is sure to appeal to new and established fans of the famous British spy," said Nicolette Tomkinson, a director at Christie's.	3	2	1

132	chuck-norris-ambushed-slovak-bridge-freedom-153045040	Despite 12,599 votes for the Norris name in a two-month online poll, Bratislava regional assembly decided to call the bridge spanning the Morava river and Slovakia's border with Austria the "Freedom Cycling-Bridge" in memory of people killed attempting to escape communist eastern Europe.	3	2	2		4	
132	chuck-norris-ambushed-slovak-bridge-freedom-153045040	The assembly's choice earned only 457 votes in the online poll, where it was easily outshone by other proposed names, including "Maria Theresa" after an Austro-Hungarian empress and "the Devinska cycling bridge" in honour of a nearby village.	3	2	2		4	
132	chuck-norris-ambushed-slovak-bridge-freedom-153045040	"We have unanimously voted for the Freedom Cycling-Bridge," Bratislava region chairman Pavol Freso told reporters.	4	2	1		4	
132	chuck-norris-ambushed-slovak-bridge-freedom-153045040	"It truly is a place where people were running for freedom through barbed wire, it is a place where many have died, so this is a dignified way how to honour these people."	3	3	2		4	
132	chuck-norris-ambushed-slovak-bridge-freedom-153045040	Slovakia, once part of the former Czechoslovakia, has a 107 km border with Austria and many people died trying to flee the communist regime before its collapse in 1989.	1	1	3		4	
132	chuck-norris-ambushed-slovak-bridge-freedom-153045040	Norris, a martial arts expert-turned film star, is known for playing tough guy characters in such classic movies as "Lone Wolf McQuade", "Missing in Action" and "The Delta Force".	2	2	1		4	
132	chuck-norris-ambushed-slovak-bridge-freedom-153045040	The actor's work has become a popular source of kitschy fun among Slovaks and a mainstay for local jokes about macho strength and invincibility.	2	3	1		4

134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	Colorado 'Frozen Dead Guy' festival to go on with or without corpse	1	2	2		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	DENVER (Reuters) - The frozen corpse that has inspired a Colorado town's whimsical "Frozen Dead Guy Days" celebration may soon be put on ice somewhere else, but festival organizers said the body's removal will not have a chilling effect on the annual event.	2	2	2		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	"We will continue on whether or not Bredo Morstoel is here," festival owner Amanda MacDonald said Wednesday of the man whose body has been packed in dry ice outside Nederland, Colorado, since 1993.	1	2	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	A financial dispute between Morstoel's grandson, Tryve Bauge, and the man hired to replenish the dry ice on a monthly basis, Bo Shaffer, has led to Bauge threatening to move his grandfather's body out of Colorado.	2	1	2		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	Each month for 18 years, Shaffer has hauled 1,700 pounds (770 kg) of dry ice - carbon dioxide in solid form - to a remote shed above Nederland to keep the corpse of Morstoel at minus-24 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-31 degrees Celsius) and in a state of cryonic suspension.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	But Shaffer said he quit after Bauge refused to pay for the rising costs of fuel and ice, which has made the endeavour unprofitable.	1	1	2		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	"It takes two of us to make the four-hour roundtrip," Shaffer told Reuters.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	"My quitting is the only way to get his (Bauge's) attention."	3	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	Bauge, who lives in Norway, did not immediately return an email message seeking comment about the dispute.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	But he told the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper that he is exploring the possibility of moving his grandfather to the Cryonics Institute in Michigan.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	Cryonics is the process of freezing and storing a corpse to prevent decomposition in anticipation of medical technology that could bring the dead back to life.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	Liquid nitrogen, which is far colder than dry ice, is typically used for cryonic preservation.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	Morstoel died of heart failure in his native Norway in 1989, and Bauge had his grandfather's body frozen and transported to a cryonics facility in California.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	Ultimately he had the corpse moved to Nederland, where Bauge lived at the time.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	When Bauge was deported because of an expired visa, he hired Shaffer to act as an unofficial caretaker.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	COFFIN RACES, HEARSE PARADE				I 	4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	At first, townspeople in the mountain village 17 miles (27 km) southwest of Boulder, Colorado, were aghast at the thought of a frozen body being stored in their midst.	2	1	2		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	But they ultimately embraced the idea of an annual festival surrounding its most famous, albeit deceased, resident.	2	2	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	The late-winter celebration features activities such as coffin races, a hearse parade, a frozen salmon toss and snow beach volleyball.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	There are even tours to the site of Morstoel's sarcophagus, although his remains are not open for viewing.	2	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	MacDonald said the festival attracts about 10,000 people over its three-day run, which is held in early March, and has taken on a life of its own, with or without its namesake dead guy.	2	2	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	The nonprofit Cryonics Institute in Clinton Township, Michigan, was founded by the late physicist Robert Ettinger, who was known as a pioneer in cryonics.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	His son, David Ettinger, said by telephone that privacy concerns prevent him from discussing any potential patients.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	However, he did say ideal candidates for suspension are people who have recently died.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	Such was the case with his father, he said, who was prepared for the procedure in the days before his death in 2011 at the age of 92.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	"We've never had a patient presented to us under those circumstances," he said of a corpse that has been packed in dry ice for nearly two decades.	1	1	1		4	
134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	The institute has about 100 suspended corpses, and charges a one-time $35,000 fee and $120 annually for "human cryopreservation."	1	1	1		4

135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	(AP) — There are, apparently, spies lurking on the golf course, which is why the Americans have been so careful in practice this week to avoid putting toward anything that looks as if it might be a possible hole location in the Ryder Cup.	3	1	2		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	It seems a bit silly, but for the people involved in this biennial golf match between a country and a continent, this is serious stuff.	3	2	3		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	That double breaker the Europeans might not see could cost one of them a hole.	2	1	2		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	Cutting the rough down could determine another match.	2	1	1		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	That could be the difference between Europe retaining the Ryder Cup, or the U.S. winning the little trophy that no one ever cared much about before the Euros started taking it away.	2	2	2		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	And that might be the difference between a golf world dominated by people whose ancestors invented the game or those who helped perfect it.	2	2	2		4

135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	For the most part they've all shown they can play under pressure, even if Michael Jordan is following them in his golf cart with a menacing look on his face.	3	2	2		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	But figuring out a way to win a team match in an individual game has perplexed team captains for years.	2	2	2		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	There's no logic to it, as evidenced by Tiger Woods being on only one winning team in his career.	2	1	2		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	When the U.S. did pull out a win at Valhalla four years ago, captain Paul Azinger wrote a book about it.	2	2	1		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	Something about pods and personalities and how that gets the ball in the hole in less strokes than your opponent, it has yet to be made into a movie.	2	2	1		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	Davis Love III might not have a book in him, even if the U.S. captain manages to lead his charges to a win in this one.	2	2	1		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	That's a good thing, because there's been so much analysis in the golf community— including 50 hours of Golf Channel alone this week — about what the two teams have to do to win that watching Justin Timberlake recite a golf poem set to music at the opening ceremony Thursday was as much a relief as it was a giggle.	2	2	1		4	
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	"It's my first Ryder Cup, you guys!" Timberlake exclaimed.	3	2	1		4

136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	Common heart drugs may be less helpful than thought	1	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The cheap and popular heart drugs known as beta-blockers may be overused in many patients, exposing them needlessly to bothersome side effects, a new study suggests.	2	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	Researchers found that people with stable heart disease who took beta-blockers were no less likely to die from their condition, or to suffer a heart attack or stroke, than were those not on the medications.	1	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	Although the study is not conclusive, it "is definitely going to make some waves," said Dr. Lydia Bazzano of Tulane University in New Orleans, who studies heart disease prevention, but wasn't part of the new work.	2	2	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	"I think there are probably plenty of people out there who are getting (beta-blockers), but don't need them," Bazzano told Reuters Health.	2	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	Beta-blockers such as atenolol and metoprolol slow the heartbeat and lower blood pressure.	1	1	1		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	They are known to shield against future heart attacks in people who just had one and can be helpful in certain types of heart failure. Older studies have suggested staying on beta-blockers in the long run may be beneficial, so many doctors have their patients take the drugs indefinitely.	1	2	1		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	But those results predate modern treatment, researchers say. And whether or not beta-blockers can ward off heart attacks in the first place is still up in the air.	1	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	Because beta-blockers are now off patent, drug companies have little incentive to study their effects in expensive clinical trials - the gold-standard in medical science for demonstrating what a treatment does and does not do.	1	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	So Dr. Sripal Bangalore of the NYU Langone Medical Center in New York and colleagues did the next-best thing. They used data from a registry of nearly 45,000 people with established coronary artery disease or risk factors for heart disease to get a sense of the drugs' efficacy.	1	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	In coronary artery disease, or CAD, the blood vessels supplying the heart are partially clogged by cholesterol buildups, which can lead to heart attacks.	1	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	The researchers sliced the registry according to whether people had suffered a heart attack, had CAD but no past heart attack, or just had risk factors such as diabetes and high blood pressure.	1	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	During an average follow-up period of 44 months, people on beta-blockers fared no better than others in any of the three groups.	1	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	In people with CAD, for instance, 12.9 percent of those on beta-blockers either died from heart disease or had a heart attack or a stroke. That compared to 13.6 percent of those not on the drugs - a difference that could easily be due to chance.	2	1	3		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	Among people with risk factors alone, 14.2 percent of those on beta-blockers had a bad outcome versus 12 percent of non-users.	1	1	1		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	There was no difference in outcomes overall among people with prior heart attacks who did or did not use beta-blockers. However, those who'd suffered a heart attack within the past year and took beta-blockers seemed to be slightly less likely to fare ill or land in the hospital due to their condition.	2	2	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	"A lot of physicians still prescribe beta-blockers, especially in patients who have known CAD," said Bangalore, whose findings are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "We need clinical trials to say which are the patients who would benefit from beta-blockers."	1	1	1		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol levels through exercise, diet changes and drugs are common ways to treat heart disease. After a heart attack, patients are also typically put on clot-busters and blood thinners such as aspirin.	1	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	Beta-blockers are cheap - a month's supply of the generic versions can be bought for less than $10 - but often cause side effects, including fatigue, depression and nightmares.	1	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	"I think there has been a movement away from beta-blockers," said Bazzano, including as a blood pressure medication. "A lot of people don't like to be on them."	2	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist who was not involved in the new study, said it is consistent with recent guidelines from the American Heart Association.	1	1	1		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	The group says beta-blockers are most effective in the first three years after a heart attack and in patients with certain types of heart failure. In other cases, their use is "optional," according to 2011 guidelines.	1	1	2		4	
136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	Krumholz, of Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, said he often leaves patients on beta-blocker therapy "forever" after a heart attack.	1	1	2		4

137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	KINSHASA (Reuters) - Any Tintin fan would feel at home in the small wooden shed in a back street of Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa, where the shelves are crammed with brightly painted statues from the famous Belgian cartoon character's adventures.	2	2	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Friendly faces are everywhere - the tufted-haired Tintin, the bearded Captain Haddock and the bumbling policemen Thomson & Thompson - lovingly carved from wood and carefully painted in bold colours.	2	3	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	But with Kinshasa preparing to receive a flood of visitors for an international summit of French-speaking countries next month, some are questioning whether Congo should turn its back on the boy journalist, whose fictional adventures in the then-Belgian colony depicts Africans as dull-witted and childish.	3	2	2		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Tintin's relationship with Congo dates back to 1930 when his creator Georges Remi - better-known by his pen name Herge - first wrote "Tintin in the Congo", in which the intrepid reporter and his little white dog Snowy tackle wild animals, hunters, diamond smugglers and warlike local chieftains.	2	1	2		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Tintin statues - which can sell for anything from $15 to $1500 - are part of Congo's roaring trade in the comic's memorabilia, business that could receive a boost next month as delegates from 56 countries across the French-speaking world gather in Kinshasa for the Francophonie summit.	2	2	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Tourists can find stalls and street vendors across the riverside capital selling the figures, and can even buy personalised paintings of the book's front cover, with their names expertly added by the artist.	1	1	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	But it is Herge's heavily stereotyped depiction of Africans as fat-lipped, childlike savages that makes Tintin a controversial cultural figure for a country trying to turn its back on a brutal colonial past followed by decades of dictatorship and conflict, according to professor Joseph Ibongo Gilungule, the director of Congo's national museum.	2	1	3		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	"Tintin is an image created by westerners, and it proves the ignorance of these people, a lack of understanding for our values," Ibongo told Reuters.	3	1	2		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Ibongo wants more people to celebrate the rich cultures of the country's estimated 250 ethnic groups.	3	2	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	His museum is a celebration of the masks, headdresses and clothing that have played an integral part in Congo's traditional values, but few of the country's 70 million inhabitants come to visit the museum.	2	2	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	BANISHED TO THE TOP SHELVES	1	1	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Ibongo is not against preserving relics of Congo's colonial past - he is trying to find money to rehabilitate the statue of controversial British colonial explorer Henry Morton Stanley, which lies forlornly toppled behind a shed at the museum.	2	1	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Nonetheless, with so many people due to visit the country for the Francophonie summit in October, he believes Congo should find a better poster boy than Tintin.	3	1	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	"There are other strong images which speak positively of this country, its peoples...	3	2	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	It would be more respectful to Congo and the whole of Africa if we spoke of images that value the Congo, and not Tintin," Ibongo added.	3	2	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Earlier this year a Congolese man studying in Belgium tried and failed to have the book banned on the grounds of racism.	1	1	2		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Some stores in Britain have banished it to the top shelves, where only adults can see it.	1	1	2		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Even Tintin's creator Herge later re-wrote parts of the story, toning down the more extreme stereotypes which sprang from Belgium's colonisation of Congo, which was brutal even by the standards of the day.	2	1	2		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Auguy Kakese, an artisan who specialises in Tintin statuettes, acknowledges that it was Europeans who first suggested he carve the figures and most of his clients remain westerners.	2	1	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	But he sees no harm in it.	2	1	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	"It's humour, it's not racist... for those who say it's racist I say that in the comic strip, you never see images which show him trying to kill the Congolese," Kakese said in his workshop, which employs 10 people and produces thousands of Tintin statues.	3	1	2		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Although most of the statues Kakese sells are of the comic's European characters, he does not shy away from depicting the Africans as well, despite them seeming uncomfortably stereotyped for modern tastes.	2	1	2		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	"We were a Belgian colony, if we work with Tintin now it's to say that the Belgians are still our brothers," he added.	3	2	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	A recent showing in Kinshasa of the Steven Spielberg-directed Tintin movie attracted a small but varied audience, everyone from Congolese to Koreans.	2	1	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Although the audience were aware of the cartoon's sometimes complex relations with Congo, none saw it as a huge problem.	2	1	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	"I really don't think it is racist, it was just the whites wanting to interpret what they saw in Congo at the time," Congolese Tito Biteketa said.	3	1	1		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	Christiana Finotti, an Italian expatriate, said she had bought a Tintin picture for her friend but acknowledged that not all her Congolese colleagues were comfortable with the association.	2	1	2		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	"Tintin in the Congo is still a little difficult, due to the style of Belgian colonialism, and due to the history...	3	1	2		4	
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	I think there's been a reconciliation, but the reconciliation hasn't been easy," she said.	3	2	2		4

138	connecticut-man-shoots-burglar-dead-turns-own-son-181159828	(Reuters) - A Connecticut man responding to his sister's call for help during an apparent burglary at her home next door, shot and killed a masked intruder who turned out to be his own teenage son, state police said on Friday.	1	1	3		4	
138	connecticut-man-shoots-burglar-dead-turns-own-son-181159828	Tyler Giuliano, 15, was wearing a ski mask and appeared to be armed when he was shot on Thursday by his father, who authorities declined to identify, said Lieutenant J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police.	1	1	3		4	
138	connecticut-man-shoots-burglar-dead-turns-own-son-181159828	The father's sister, who lives next door, was home alone before 1 a.m. when she called him to report someone trying to break into her home.	1	1	1		4	
138	connecticut-man-shoots-burglar-dead-turns-own-son-181159828	The father went over to investigate and was approached by a masked person dressed entirely in black and holding a shiny object, police said in a statement.	1	1	1		4	
138	connecticut-man-shoots-burglar-dead-turns-own-son-181159828	"Believing the suspect was armed with a weapon and about to attack him, the (father) discharged his personal handgun at the suspect," police said in the statement.	1	1	2		4	
138	connecticut-man-shoots-burglar-dead-turns-own-son-181159828	Giuliano was pronounced dead at the scene.	1	1	3		4	
138	connecticut-man-shoots-burglar-dead-turns-own-son-181159828	"(He) was lying on the ground in the driveway with obvious gunshot injuries, holding a weapon," the statement said.	2	1	2		4	
138	connecticut-man-shoots-burglar-dead-turns-own-son-181159828	Vance declined to further describe the weapon.	1	1	1		4	
138	connecticut-man-shoots-burglar-dead-turns-own-son-181159828	Authorities seized the father's gun, were investigating whether it is registered and will consult with the state's attorney to determine if any charges will be filed, Vance said.	1	1	1		4	
138	connecticut-man-shoots-burglar-dead-turns-own-son-181159828	Police also were investigating why the teen, who has no criminal history, was outside his aunt's home.	1	1	1		4

139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	ASTANA (Reuters) - U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips is ready to exit the consortium developing Kazakhstan's Kashagan oil field, Kazakh officials said, giving the state first option on increasing ownership of the biggest oil find since the 1960s.	3	1	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	A more assertive Kazakhstan, seeking greater returns on the large energy projects that will drive central Asia's biggest economy over the next decade, has sought to revise deals struck with foreign energy companies in the lean post-Soviet years.	3	3	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	Asked on Tuesday whether ConocoPhillips would sell its stake in the consortium, Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev told reporters: "They have informed that they have the intention of selling."	3	2	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	ConocoPhillips would not confirm its plans for the Kashagan stake.	1	1	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	"Unless formally announced by our company, ConocoPhillips does not comment on ongoing business development or commercial activities," spokesman Daren Beaudo said in an email.	3	1	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	The Houston-based company, however, has been conducting a disposal program to reduce its non-core overseas assets.	1	1	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	It has already exceeded its target of asset sales worth $20 billion by the end of 2012, including the sale of its stake in LUKOIL , Russia's second-biggest oil producer.	2	1	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	Proceeds from the disposals are to be used for debt reduction, dividend payments and exploration.	1	3	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	Kazakhstan, home to 3 percent of the world's recoverable oil reserves, has moved to exert greater management control and secure bigger revenues from foreign-owned oil and gas developments.	2	2	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	Previous reshuffles of North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), the consortium developing Kashagan, have seen state company KazMunaiGas muscle in, prompting Western partners to seek assurances that they will be able to develop the offshore field's more lucrative second phase.	2	2	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	KazMunaiGas first entered the Kashagan consortium as a shareholder in 2005 and later doubled its stake to 16.81 percent.	1	1	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	Identical stakes are held by Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Italy's Eni and French company Total .	1	1	1		4

139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	Mynbayev said that Kazakhstan planned to raise output to 130 million metric tonnes (143.3 million tons) by 2020, from 81 million tonnes this year, through expansion at Kashagan, the Chevron-led Tengiz field and the Karachaganak oil and gas condensate field	3	1	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	Kashagan's first phase, which has been delayed by rising costs and technical complications, is likely to pump its first oil by the end of March 2013, the minister said.	3	2	2		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	The first phase of production is expected to yield between 370,000 and 450,000 barrels per day (bpd).	2	1	1		4	
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	A second phase, yet to be agreed with the government, could raise output to 1 million bpd.	2	1	1		4

143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	Used by fire departments, the military, college sports teams and in gyms, Crossfitters tackle an array of physical challenges and follow daily workouts posted on a website.	1	1	2		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"I really do like them in terms of the strength and the challenge," said Liz Neporent, the author of "Fitness for Dummies, said about the exercises."	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"Why not maximize your time?	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	If you're going to do it, do it.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	Don't fool around."	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	Crossfit training is the invention of Greg Glassman, a gymnastics coach who opened the first Crossfit facility in Santa Cruz, California in 1995.	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"Crossfit is more of a movement than an organization," Neporent said.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"There's a website but it's basically individuals, gyms, and groups doing it."	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	Crossfitters don't say they visit the gym; instead they head into "the box," which is a Crossfit training center for the WOD or workout of the day, which is posted daily.	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"Today I'm doing 100 squats, 100 push-ups, 100 crunches," said Neporent, "which is about half a WOD."	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	A lot of people, she said, would not be able to walk afterwards.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"That's what you have to understand about Crossfit.	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	For some people it's aspirational."	1	1	2		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	Casey Kirch, an instructor at Crossfit East Village in San Diego, California, believes the timed intensity of Crossfit shows results quicker than traditional strength training.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"When you're working against the clock you'll work harder," he said.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	For Kirch, one exercise, called the burpee, illustrates the love-hate relationship Crossfitters have to their WOD.	1	2	2		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	He said from a standing position you squat down, put your hands on the floor, kick your feet behind you.	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	Then you lower yourself to the floor, push up, jump to your feet, stand up and jump in the air.	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	Then you do it as many times as you can.	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"It's a move everyone dreads," he said.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"But no matter what someone's fitness level, if they do just a few they'll quickly build up to more.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	It's immediate satisfaction."	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	A personal trainer for seven years, Kirch has seen too many people give up when they don't see changes soon enough.	1	1	2		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	At his center the sessions last an hour although the WOD might be just 20 or 30 minutes of often grueling intensity.	1	1	2		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	The rest of the time is spent on stretching, warming up and on technique.	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"We don't have machines," Kirch said.	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"We don't have treadmills or cardio equipment or strength training machines."	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	Rather the so-called box holds squat racks, Olympic barbells, kettle bells, medicine balls, jump ropes, tires and climbing ropes.	2	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"Most things are based around body weight and barbells," he explained.	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	Proper technique is crucial to safely execute the moves, Kirch said, and most, if not all, centers have a mandatory foundation course.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"If someone says they've been doing Crossfit at another gym, we'll do a test to make sure they know the movements," he said.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	American Council on Exercise spokesperson Jessica Matthews said her maiden Crossfit session left her with a major sweat and a pretty strong feeling of empowerment.	1	2	2		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"I like the style," said Matthews, an exercise physiologist.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"They focus on foundational, functional movements.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	They do a lot of total body movements and integrated exercises, such as squats, kettlebell swings and presses.	1	3	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	It's an approach I totally agree with."	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	Matthews's session also included a two-lap warm-up run around the block and a few rounds on a rowing machine.	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	Trickier for her is what she calls the "scalability portion" of the Crossfit philosophy: the notion that it works for everyone from the elite athlete to the overweight grandmother.	1	2	2		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"You go for time," she said of the WODs.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"We know that when we manipulate intensity by adding variables like speed, people not as seasoned may sacrifice initial base form."	1	2	2		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	She was nonetheless delighted that instead of the tough talk so characteristic of Crossfit websites, which usually promise that butts will be kicked and specialists punished, camaraderie and encouragement ruled the WOD.	1	3	2		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"The environment was intense but not intimidating," she said.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	"They (her 10 session mates) looked like average people doing the workouts.	1	1	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	It's a community.	1	2	1		4	
143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	We're all in the box."	1	1	1		4

144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	SEATTLE (Reuters) - One of Boeing's chief labor unions staged rallies in and around Seattle this week, calling attention to a vote set for Monday that will show whether workers are willing to accept a less generous contract offered by Boeing Co or move closer to a strike.				i	2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Hundreds of engineers and technicians marched at the company's two plants, its downtown Seattle office and other facilities with signs saying "Boeing: Hands Off My Healthcare" and "We Delivered.	1	1	1	s	2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Will Boeing?"	1	1	1	s	2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	It was the most visible sign of rising tension over contracts covering 23,000 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	The contracts, which affect two bargaining units, expire on October 6, and a separate vote would be needed to authorize a strike.	1	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Though the union is widely expected to vote down the current offer, local officials and analysts consider a strike unlikely, because both sides have so much to lose and workers can keep using the current contract even after it expires.	3	2	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Stan Sorscher, a Speea labor representative and former engineer, estimated the chance of a strike at 35 percent.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Scott Hamilton, managing director at consulting firm Leeham Co., said Boeing likely will make a second contract offer and that will restart negotiations.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"We believe we can get to an agreement," said Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman.	3	2	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"Nobody here is talking about" a strike.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"Nobody wants that."	3	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Still officials and analysts say it is worrying that Boeing's first offer is going to a vote amid worker rallies.	1	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	REASONS TO AGREE				i	2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Boeing has a backlog of 4,057 orders, and is racing to speed up its factories to make more jets, especially 787 Dreamliners, whose customers have been waiting through years of delays.	1	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Boeing also is deciding on specifications for a new derivative of its popular 777.	2	2	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	And it needs engineers to help repair a number of 787s that rolled off the line with flaws and must be fixed before they can be delivered.	1	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	While in limbo, the jets weigh on Boeing's financial performance, analysts said.	1	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"A strike by Speea would cripple Boeing," said Ray Goforth, Speea's executive director.	3	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"They cannot deliver airplanes without our members" who are involved in certifying jets before they go to customers.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	For the union, a strike could reduce its relevance and its ranks, which already are under pressure from retirement of senior workers and outsourcing.	2	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Boeing has moved large amounts of engineering work to its suppliers and aims to move more despite the technical problems and cost overruns that resulted from using foreign engineers for the 787.	1	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Various engineering groups did not coordinate well, and key pieces, such as wings, did not work well and needed to be re-engineered.	1	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Boeing attributes those problems at least in part to flawed execution of the distributed engineering model, not the model itself, and says it will continue to tap engineers from anywhere, even if not from Speea's mostly Puget Sound workforce.	1	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Goforth, the Speea leader, said the union could do damage without a strike, by having engineers "work-to-rule" - refusing overtime and following all procedures.	2	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"Boeing has more rules, regulations and guidelines than any company I've ever seen," he said.	4	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"If the employees start strictly complying with all of them, you'd see productions problems immediately and the employees would still be collecting paychecks."	3	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Investors and customers could lose in either scenario.	2	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Boeing's stock price, which closed at $69.60 on Friday, up 12 percent in the last year, likely would fall, and plane deliveries would be delayed.	2	1	3		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"I hope they resolve it," Tim Clark, president of Emirates airline, Boeing's biggest 777 customer with 75 unfilled orders, said of the labor trouble while in Seattle on Thursday.	2	2	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"I hope our orders and those of others help give them a way through."	2	2	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	RETIREMENT EFFECT				i	2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	The two sides face another issue: Age.	1	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	More than 40 percent of Boeing's engineers will be eligible to retire in five years.	1	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	These experienced problem-solvers are referred to as the "bow wave," because once they depart, Boeing has relatively few experienced engineers behind them to take over.	2	2	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Boeing actively recruits engineers at all levels.	1	2	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"Our goal is to always retain the best talent and to hire the best talent," Alder said.	2	3	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Yet engineers with experience working on several different jet programs will be harder to find once older workers retire.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Engineering skill is "fast dwindling" across the aerospace and defense industries, says Tom Captain, an analyst at Deloitte.	3	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"If you go to the website of any aerospace company, you'll see tons of openings for engineers.	3	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	We can't fill the jobs that we need to fill right now."	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Using figures from Boeing, Speea calculates that 42 percent of its engineers are age 50 or older, and could retire starting at 55.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Among the lower-paid technicians, 56 percent are 50 or older.	1	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	The recession kept older engineers working - a few are in their 70s and 80s.	1	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Now, as the economy improves, older workers will retire, Captain predicts.	3	2	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"The people who are most valuable and able to mentor and teach the younger ones are retiring because of age," he says.	2	2	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Retirees also will push down the average wage of the remaining workers.	1	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	The union says the average annual engineer income is $110,000.	1	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	That should fall in coming years, since the average salary of new and re-hired engineers is $81,000, according to Speea's calculations using records from Boeing.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"Each retiree-replacement is hired at a lower salary than the retiree they are replacing, which drops the average salary of the entire unit slightly," said Matt Kempf, Speea's benefits director.	1	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	MORE BARGAINING				i	2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Local officials say they are puzzled at how the situation has unfolded.	3	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Some compare the current tension to 2008, when they say Boeing's Chicago leaders thought the offer to the machinists union would be accepted by members.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	The members soundly rejected it, and later voted to go on a costly, bitter, 57-day strike.	2	1	3		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"I think Chicago is making the same mistake with Speea," said Hamilton, at Leeham, referring to the company's Midwestern headquarters.	3	1	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	He thinks members will strongly reject the contract.	3	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Similarly, the union's moves are seen as unusually strident.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Boeing's contract offers raises of 3.5 percent every year for engineers for four years.	1	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	The offer also asks employees to pay more of the cost for healthcare - a concession many workers are making in an economy with unemployment above 8 percent.	1	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"We would ask them to pay more and the company would also be paying more," Alder said.	2	2	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"Our goal is to maintain the current plan.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Any increase in medical costs would be offset by the increase in salary."	2	2	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	The union says the contract also would allow Boeing to eliminate medical benefits for retired employees, a charge Boeing denies.	2	2	2		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"Boeing has no plans to eliminate retiree medical benefits for current retirees," the company said.	2	2	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Alder said that questions about wording would have been discussed had the sides stayed at the bargaining table.	3	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	The union says the tone of the talks changed after commercial airplanes chief Jim Albaugh, a former engineer, stepped down abruptly in June, and was succeeded by Ray Conner, a sales and support vice president.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	The union says it is now dealing mostly with negotiators from Chicago, rather than local officials that they know.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	Boeing says the negotiating team is unchanged and the company is eager to resume talks, right after Monday's vote, to agree on a new contract.	2	2	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"We'll be waiting on the vote," Alder said.	2	1	1		2	
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	"If it's 'No,' our number one goal is to get back to the table on Tuesday."	2	2	2		2

146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - Fans can expect a high-octane contest between two star-studded teams in this week's Ryder Cup at Medinah where the United States host holders Europe for the 39th edition of the biennial competition.	2	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	Never before has the trans-Atlantic showdown featured two line-ups bristling with so much firepower and strength in depth, with big-hitting world number 35 Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium the lowest-ranked of the 24 golfers in action.	2	1	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	For the first time in two decades, a European team can boast the game's leading player and in Rory McIlroy they possess a man who has already been targeted by the United States.	1	1	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	"Obviously, he's a marked man," U.S. Ryder Cup veteran Jim Furyk said at last week's Tour Championship in Atlanta. "He's the number one player in the world. He's going to garner all the attention, as well he should. He's played phenomenal this year.	2	3	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	"(He) won the PGA (Championship) by a ton of shots ... he's right now the present-day Tiger Woods where everyone's eyes are on him."	2	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	While double major winner McIlroy heads the world rankings, Europe also have third-ranked Luke Donald, Lee Westwood (four), Justin Rose (five), Graeme McDowell (18) and Sergio Garcia (19) among a total of nine players in the top 30.	1	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	The U.S. counter with 11 in the top 20 - Woods (two), Bubba Watson (seven), Webb Simpson (eight), Jason Dufner (nine), Steve Stricker (12), Dustin Johnson (13), Keegan Bradley (14), Matt Kuchar (15), Phil Mickelson (16) and Zach Johnson (17).	1	1	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	"It's pretty phenomenal, really," said Furyk, who this week will be playing on his eighth U.S. Ryder Cup team. "To have 24 players of the top 35 is mind-boggling.	2	3	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	"We are really happy with our team, it's really strong, but we have our hands full. There's a strong team on the other side and we'll have to play them real tough."	1	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	Europe have triumphed eight times in the last 13 Ryder Cups but they face a challenging task on American soil where the U.S. have lost only three times since the matches began in 1927.	2	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	"We are playing away and they are going to have the crowd advantage," said European captain Jose Maria Olazabal. "They are going to set up the course to their liking.	1	1	2		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	"At the end of the day, we are going to have to play really very, very well and hard if we want to have a chance to win."	1	1	2		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	CLOSELY MATCHED	1	1	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	However, Spaniard Olazabal also felt the two teams would be very closely matched.	1	1	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	"I've always said that I don't see any favourites in this Ryder Cup," he said. "Both teams are playing very strong. The U.S. team is always strong. They have played great.	1	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	"They won the Masters (through Watson) this year. They won the U.S. Open (Simpson). They won a bunch of tournaments. I don't see any favourites at all."	1	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	Since 1981, there has been very little to choose between the two teams in terms of matchplay grit and ability. The knack of holing putts at the right time under intense pressure has been the decisive factor.	1	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	The Americans last won the Ryder Cup at Valhalla in 2008 when their captain Paul Azinger shrewdly inspired team cohesion with a four-man 'pod' system and prepared the venue with very little rough and fast greens to suit his power hitters.	1	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	This week, U.S. captain Davis Love III has set up Medinah Country Club's No. 3 Course in similar fashion.	1	1	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	"You don't want to see players chipping out (from rough) and putting for par at the Ryder Cup," said Love, who competed in six Ryder Cups. "You want to see birdies. You want to see excitement.	2	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	"We've set it up the way we think fans will like it. We're a long-hitting, free-wheeling, fun-to-watch team. And I think it's going to be fun to watch."	1	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	Woods, the greatest player of his generation and arguably of all time, missed out on the U.S. Ryder Cup victory in 2008 while recovering from knee surgery. No surprise, then, that he is eager to taste team success this week at Medinah.	2	2	1		4	
146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	"I've only been part of one winning Ryder Cup team since my (debut) time in '97," he said. "We didn't play well at the right time, and that's just the way it goes. Hopefully this year we'll play well at the right time."	1	2	1		4

148	czechs-set-first-presidential-election-jan-11-12-092443089	PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs will hold their first presidential election on January 11 and 12 to replace outgoing euroskeptic leader Vaclav Klaus, the speaker of the upper house of parliament said on Monday.	2	1	1		4	
148	czechs-set-first-presidential-election-jan-11-12-092443089	Up to now, the country's parliament has chosen the president.	1	1	1		4	
148	czechs-set-first-presidential-election-jan-11-12-092443089	But the assembly agreed to hand that power over to the electorate amid calls for more open democracy, fuelled by a growing public perception of cronyism and corruption in the country's political parties.	2	2	3		4	
148	czechs-set-first-presidential-election-jan-11-12-092443089	Opinion polls suggest the leading candidates to replace Klaus are former prime ministers Milos Zeman and Jan Fischer, in office from 1998-2002 and 2009-2010, respectively.	1	1	1		4	
148	czechs-set-first-presidential-election-jan-11-12-092443089	Both men are much more in favor of closer cooperation with the European Union than Klaus.	2	2	1		4

148	czechs-set-first-presidential-election-jan-11-12-092443089	Fischer is running as an independent candidate while Zeman has the support of a leftist SPOZ party, a small splinter group from the center-left Social Democratic party he used to lead.	1	1	1		4	
148	czechs-set-first-presidential-election-jan-11-12-092443089	Political analysts say their popularity is another reminder of the public's exasperation with the country's larger, mainstream parties, following a round of harsh austerity measures and sleaze scandals.	3	2	3		4	
148	czechs-set-first-presidential-election-jan-11-12-092443089	Czech presidents do not have the executive powers held by the leaders of France or the United States.	1	1	2		4

149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	Dairy products won't make you skinny, evidence says	1	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Adding a couple of servings of milk or yogurt to your daily diet probably won't help you drop any pants sizes, according to a new analysis of past studies.	2	1	2		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	Some research has suggested dairy products may help people feel full for longer, or that the calcium in milk and yogurt can prevent the build-up of fat tissue.	1	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	But those remain unproven theories.	1	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	"The results are not very consistent," said Dr. Frank Hu, a nutrition researcher from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston who worked on the new review.	2	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	"Overall, I think the evidence doesn't support the claim that dairy products are beneficial for weight loss," he said.	3	1	2		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	Hu and his colleagues analyzed the results of 29 studies including a total of 2,101 participants, some of whom were randomly assigned to add extra dairy to their diets.	1	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	The set-ups of those studies varied widely, with dairy intakes ranging from one to more than six servings per day and diet interventions lasting between one month and two years.	1	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	Some studies put participants on a reduced-calorie diet to promote weight loss, while others did not.	1	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	On average, people assigned to the extra-dairy groups lost 0.3 more pounds - about 0.14 kilograms - than the comparison group, a difference that could have been due to chance.	1	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	They did lose slightly more body fat - about one extra pound worth.	1	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	When the researchers broke down the results further, they found dairy products seemed to confer some benefit over the short term when they were part of a weight-loss diet.	1	2	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	But otherwise, adding more milk, yogurt and cheese didn't help people lose weight or keep it off, Hu and his colleagues reported in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.	1	1	2		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	Angelo Tremblay, an obesity researcher at Laval University in Quebec, Canada, said dairy products may still aid the weight-loss goals of people who aren't getting much milk or yogurt in their current diet.	2	2	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	"Many studies which are used to discuss the issue were performed in normal calcium consumers… and then it is not so much a surprise to see that there is no effect, or only a trivial effect," Tremblay, who wasn't involved in the new analysis, told Reuters Health.				i	3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	"It is always the same story," he said.	2	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	"If you wish to measure the effect of physical activity, in an already very active individual or active individuals you have more chance not to see any effect."	2	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	Still, even in dairy-deficient people, adding a couple of extra milk or yogurt servings would only be expected to have a small impact on weight, Tremblay said.	2	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends teens and adults get three cups of low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt per day.	2	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	According to guidelines, one cup of milk is also equivalent to one and a half ounces of natural cheese or two ounces of processed cheese.	1	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	But that has to be incorporated into a generally healthy and balanced diet, researchers said.	1	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	"The bottom line is still energy balance," Hu told Reuters Health.	2	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	For people hoping to control their weight, "I don't think it's a good idea to add dairy on top of their diet," he said.	3	1	2		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	"If their baseline dairy is low, if they want to increase their dairy consumption, they have to reduce something else," such as sugar-sweetened drinks or less-healthy protein sources like processed meat.	3	1	1		3	
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	Making those healthier substitutions, Hu added, "may not have a direct benefit on body weight, but it certainly may have other health benefits."	3	2	1		3

151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	WASHINGTON (AP) — A spate of data Thursday painted a mixed picture of the U.S. economy: Demand for long-lasting manufactured goods fell and slightly fewer people signed contracts to buy homes.	2	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	At the same time, the job market looked a little better.	1	2	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	Taken together, the reports suggest the economy is growing only modestly and not quickly enough to spur much hiring.	1	1	2		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	"The economy overall has only weak forward momentum," Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a note to clients.	1	1	2		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	"The news from housing may be improving, but manufacturing is struggling now."	2	1	2		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	Most of the data seemed discouraging on the surface.	2	1	2		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	But a closer inspection of the details offered some promise.	1	2	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	— Companies cut orders for long-lasting goods by 13.2 percent in August, the Commerce Department said.	1	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	That was the biggest drop in more than three years but it was largely influenced by a 102 percent decline in volatile aircraft orders.	2	1	2		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	Excluding transportation equipment, orders fell only 1.6 percent.	1	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	And in a positive sign, orders in a category that reflect business investment plans rose 1.1 percent, the first increase since May.	1	2	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	— The overall economy grew at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, much lower than the 1.7 percent the government previously estimated.	1	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	About half of the downward revision stemmed from the severe drought in the Midwest, which cut overall farm output.	1	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	But growth also fell because exports and consumer spending expanded at a slower pace.	1	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	— The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy previously occupied homes fell in August from a two-year high in July.	1	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	The National Association of Realtors said its index of sales agreements declined 2.6 percent to 99.2.	1	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	That's just below the reading of 100 that is considered healthy.	2	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	Still, the index is 10.7 percent higher than a year ago.	1	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	Economists expect growth to hover near or below 2 percent for the rest of the year.	1	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	That's typically too weak to create enough jobs to lower the unemployment rate.	1	1	2		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	One report appeared to offer some hope that the job market will improve.	2	2	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	Weekly applications for unemployment benefits plunged 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 359,000, the lowest level in two months, the Labor Department said.	1	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	The four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell to 374,000.	1	1	1		4	
151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	Applications are a measure of the pace of layoffs.	1	1	1		4

153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	Death penalty recommended for California man who set deadly wildfire	1	1	4		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	(Reuters) - A California jury on Friday recommended a death sentence for a man found guilty of starting a 2003 wildfire that burned nearly 100,000 acres, damaged more than 1,000 homes and led to the deaths of five people, prosecutors said.	1	1	4		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	Rickie Lee Fowler, 31, had already been convicted of arson and five counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of people prosecutors said lived in the fire's path and died from heart attacks caused by the stress of evacuation and threats to their homes.	1	1	5		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	"We take capital punishment seriously.	3	1	2		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	We don't seek capital punishment on every murder," San Bernardino District Attorney Michael Ramos said.	2	2	2		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	"It's for those people who are most horrendous murderers, rapists - people like Rickie Fowler."	4	1	5		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	The death sentence recommendation, on which the judge will make a final ruling at a later hearing, comes just over a month before California voters will decide on a November ballot measure whether to repeal the death penalty in a state that is home to nearly a quarter of the nation's death-row inmates.	1	1	2		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	The October 2003 blaze that Fowler was convicted of starting, called the Old Fire, burned in the San Bernardino Mountains of Southern California, eventually scorching 91,281 acres.	1	1	3		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	A 2009 grand jury indictment in the case determined that Fowler, while not the actual killer of the five people, started the fire with "reckless indifference to human life."	2	2	3		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	Prosecutors note that individuals who commit a serious violent felony - like robbery, kidnapping, or arson - that results in death are eligible for capital punishment.	1	1	4		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	Jurors deliberated for 11 days during the trial's penalty phase before returning a death sentence recommendation, prosecutors said.	1	1	3		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	While the death penalty remains on the books in California, the state has executed just 13 people since reinstating capital punishment in 1978.	1	2	3		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	More than 720 inmates sit on death row in California, pending long, expensive appeals.	2	1	3		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	A federal judge halted all California executions in 2006 after ruling that a three-drug protocol used for lethal injections carried the risk of causing inmates too much pain and suffering before death.	1	2	4		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	California has since revised its protocol, but an appeals court has blocked a resumption of executions.	1	2	2		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	Fowler had already been sentenced under California's three-strikes law to 75 years to life in prison for committing sodomy against another inmate while behind bars, prosecutors said.	1	1	4		4	
153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	They added that he had prior convictions for rape and drug offenses.	1	1	4		4

154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	Debate on bringing wolves to Colo goes to US court	1	1	1		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	DENVER (AP) — An argument over whether wolves should be returned to Rocky Mountain National Park to reduce an overabundance of elk is moving to a federal appeals court.	1	2	2		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado will hear the case Thursday.	1	1	1		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	The park often has so many elk that they overgraze on trees, shrubs and grass, leaving other animals without enough food and habitat.	2	1	2		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	Few natural predators are left there, and hunting is prohibited in all national parks, so little remains to keep the elk population in check.	1	1	2		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	The park uses National Park Service personnel and trained volunteers to periodically shoot and kill a specified number of elk.	1	1	3		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	Officials rejected the idea of reintroducing wolves to prey on the elk and control their numbers, saying it was infeasible.	1	1	2		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	They cited a lack of support from other agencies, safety concerns of people who live nearby, expected conflicts between wolves and humans and the amount of attention that a wolf population would require of park officials.	1	1	3		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	The wildlife advocacy group WildEarth Guardians sued the Park Service in 2008, asking a Denver federal court judge to overturn the policy.	1	2	1		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	The group said the Park Service didn't fully consider reintroducing wolves, and that using volunteers to kill elk amounts to hunting in the park, which would violate federal law.	1	1	3		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	The judge disagreed, upholding the policy in 2011, and WildEarth Guardians appealed to the 10th Circuit.	1	1	2		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	Rocky Mountain National Park launched a 20-year program in 2008 to thin the elk herd by shooting a number that varies from year to year, depending on the size of the park's overall herd.	1	1	2		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	The program also includes fencing elk out of some areas to protect vegetation and redistributing some of the animals.	1	2	2		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	Park spokeswoman Kyle Patterson said 131 elk have been killed in the culling program during the winters starting in 2008, 2009 and 2010.	1	1	2		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	The current size of the elk herd in the park's lower elevations is 600 to 800, which is within the target range set by the program, so no elk were killed last year.	1	2	1		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	The park website says weather, hunting outside the park and changes in elk movement patterns have helped keep the numbers low.	1	2	1		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	No decision has been made on whether or how many elk will be killed in the upcoming winter.	1	1	2		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	Wolves disappeared from many parts of the West after decades of hunting and government-backed extermination.	1	1	3		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	They were re-introduced in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in 1995, and some advocates have argued for bringing them back elsewhere.	1	2	1		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	Wolves ignite heated and emotional debates in the West, with some people saying the predators are a threat to human safety and ranchers' livelihoods, and others arguing they are a vital part of natural ecosystems and inspiring to see in the wild.	1	2	2		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	By contrast, the arguments in the lawsuit before the 10th Circuit are largely about dry-sounding procedural questions, chiefly whether the Park Service followed the letter of the law in rejecting wolf reintroduction and whether using trained volunteers to shoot excess elk is "culling" or "hunting."	3	1	3		3	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	The 10th Circuit normally meets in Denver but will hear oral arguments in this case at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder as part of an outreach program.	1	1	1		3

155	debate-promises-kept-163400738	Over and over, Obama reassured those folks with insurance plans they currently like that the Affordable Care Act wouldn't change their health payment arrangements.	1	1	1		4	
155	debate-promises-kept-163400738	This was a technical truth that concealed a misdirection.	2	1	2		4	
155	debate-promises-kept-163400738	It is very likely that insurance companies, forced to offer new benefits, will raise premiums on plans that are currently affordable; or maybe insurance companies will eliminate certain unprofitable policies, or decide they can't do business with certain companies.	2	1	2		4	
155	debate-promises-kept-163400738	It's true that market forces would influence the options offered by insurance companies regardless of whether ObamaCare had passed, but ObamaCare all but guarantees that every major insurance company is going to radically change the menu of plans it offers.	3	1	2		4

155	debate-promises-kept-163400738	Arguably, there is no way around this. Arguably, if Obama had conceded to the American people that ObamaCare would indeed change their insurance policies in the future, the bill would not have passed.	2	1	1		4	
155	debate-promises-kept-163400738	I think the White House consciously decided to believe the "technical truth" because the real truth was so politically unpalatable… even though it may have been in pursuit of policies that lead to better outcomes for more people.	3	2	2		4

157	definition-american-dream-105253284	The siren call of the American dream may not be as powerful as it once was, but we are still a nation of believers, new research shows.	2	2	2		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	Like the American population, the demographics of those who believe in the dream have changed over time.	1	1	1		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	But the majority of us still believe the U.S. is a place where anyone can achieve fame and fortune.	3	3	1		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	In fact, fame and fortune have replaced faith and family as the linchpins of the American dream, a survey of more than 500 U.S. adults over 18 discovered.	1	3	1		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	The survey was conducted by JWT, a marketing communications company.	1	1	1		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	Almost two-thirds of Americans said the dream is different from what it used to be.	1	1	1		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	The country is moving away from traditional notions of the ideal life — one centered around community and family, with religious faith and middle-class values as the guiding ethos — toward one focused on making and spending money and winning recognition, the survey found.				I	4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	While the dream is very much alive and attainable, achieving it is more of a challenge, the survey found.	1	3	2		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	Almost 7 in 10 respondents said the dream became harder to realize for middle-class people in the past five to 10 years, up from 4 in 10 in 2008.	1	1	2		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	And some hold the conviction that white, native-born Americans have the cards stacked against them, even though statistics indicate otherwise.	2	1	2		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	The exceptionalism of the American dream is also being questioned by younger Americans.	2	1	1		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	While a majority of older generations believe the dream is unique, only 4 in 10 millennials hold that view.	1	2	2		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	Despite everything, though, belief in the dream endures, dented though it may be.	2	2	2		4	
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	"While the dream is losing its luster, and Americans recognize that it's becoming significantly harder to achieve, the concept endures; 7 in 10 still believe in the idea, not much fewer than in 2008," said Ann Mack, JWT's director of trendspotting.	2	2	2		4

161	did-cavemen-dentists-074500005	Cavities can be excruciating, and new evidence suggests prehistoric man used a surprisingly sophisticated technique to deal with the pain: Dental fillings. A team of scientists in Italy have identified a 6,500-year-old cracked tooth repaired with beeswax, suggesting our early ancestors knew a thing or two about dental work. A closer look at the findings:	2	2	1		4	
161	did-cavemen-dentists-074500005	What did researchers find?The study, outlined in the journal PLoS One, takes a look at a fossilized jaw bone discovered in Slovenia near Trieste. Of special interest was the left canine, which sported a large crack that "exposed some of the inner enamel and tissues within the tooth called dentin," says Brian Fung at The Atlantic. In other words: It probably caused a lot of pain.	2	1	2		4

161	did-cavemen-dentists-074500005	And it was repaired with beeswax?Yes. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the ancient filling to be beeswax, while radiocarbon dating found that it was about 6,500 years old. In all likelihood, the procedure was done either shortly before or after the 24- to 30-year-old individual's death. The team could not rule out the possibility that the wax was "added during a funerary ritual," says Rossella Lorenzi at Discovery News, although evidence suggests it was added while the young man was still alive.	2	1	1		4	
161	did-cavemen-dentists-074500005	Why do they think that?The severity of the crack has researchers believing the tooth was incredibly sensitive, and probably caused him a lot of discomfort. For example other teeth had exposed dentin yet no beeswax was applied. That means if the dental work was done when he was still alive, they write, "the intervention was likely aimed to relieve tooth sensitivity derived from either exposed dentin... or the pain resulting from chewing on a cracked tooth." Essentially, it's the oldest "therapeutic-palliative dental filling" found to date.	3	2	2		4

161	did-cavemen-dentists-074500005	Was the cavity caused by eating bad food?Probably not. The "severe wear and tear" on the tooth was probably due to other activities, says Charles Choi at LiveScience. Men, for instance, regularly used their teeth to soften leather or help make tools. "At the moment, we do not have any idea if this is an isolated case or if similar interventions were quite spread in Neolithic Europe," researcher Frederico Bernardini tells LiveScience. The next project for the team will be to figure out how widespread these types of dental practices really were.	3	1	1		4

162	did-mumford-sons-bigger-justin-bieber-171500422	1. Their digital sales are spectacularThe total LP sales are impressive, says Chris Martins at Spin, but there's another key part of the story: Digital sales are booming.	2	2	1		4	
162	did-mumford-sons-bigger-justin-bieber-171500422	It's likely that Babel will earn the second-highest number of weekly sales for a digital album ever (behind Lady Gaga's Born This Way).	1	2	1		4

162	did-mumford-sons-bigger-justin-bieber-171500422	Mumford & Sons has more in common with artists like Radiohead or Coldplay, who don't depend on Top 40 or radio support, than artists like Rihanna or Katy Perry, who have built their careers on radio-friendly singles.	1	1	1		4	
162	did-mumford-sons-bigger-justin-bieber-171500422	4. Their music is uplifting"Mumford & Sons is essentially Tim Tebow in an indie-rock context," says Steven Hyden at Grantland.	2	2	1		4	
162	did-mumford-sons-bigger-justin-bieber-171500422	In both music and personality, frontman Marcus Mumford exudes a "wholesome, inspirational" warmth, with lyrics that dismiss cynicism and encourage hope.	3	2	1		4

163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	Now that it's been disfigured in a botched restoration attempt revealed a month ago, it has found a new fate as a global icon — used to sell products around the world.	1	2	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	And Cecilia Gimenez, the 80-year-old pensioner behind the disastrous touch-up, is exploring her intellectual property rights.	2	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	The fresco depicts Christ with a crown of thorns before crucifixion, in a style style known as "Ecce Homo" (Behold the Man).	1	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	It stood in peaceful obscurity in the Misericordia Sanctuary since its creation in 1930 — until Gimenez, a longtime devotee of the work, decided it needed to be rescued from flaking caused by the damp church air.	1	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	The result was so awful that it could only be destined for one thing: worldwide fame.	3	2	2		3

163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	Gimenez has gone into hiding in her hometown of Borja, about a four-hour drive from Madrid, to avoid countless international media interview requests.	1	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	The town itself has morphed into a tourism destination for people who want to see her restoration.	1	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	The crush has been so big that the Santi Spiritus foundation that owns the Misercordia church and sanctuary recently started charging admission: one euro per visitor.	1	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	Meanwhile, Internet entrepreneurs have quickly moved in to cash in on the phenomenon, printing "Ecce Mono" on a seemingly endless range of products to sell online.	1	2	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	Gimenez' lawyers say she has no interest in a cut of what the foundation is charging people to see the fresco.	1	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	But they are gearing up to put a stop to potential copyright violations of what she created — even though she had not set out to create anything at all.	1	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	"We want to put some order to this anarchy," said Antonio Val Carreras Rivera, one of her lawyers.	3	2	2		3

163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	If the lawyers determine she does, Gimenez could pursue payments from those using the image to sell products, Carreras Rivera said, adding that whatever she earns will go to charity.	2	2	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	She's most interested in funding groups that help people with congenital muscular dystrophy, because she has a son with the disorder.	1	2	2		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	While Gimenez' lawyers research her legal rights, the Sancti Spiritus foundation is stuck in its own legal bind about what to do with the fresco.	1	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	Should it restore the painting to its original state?	1	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	Or leave Gimenez' image on the church walls?	1	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	Or try, as experts say is possible, to separate the two?	1	1	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	Gimenez herself is thankful for the many messages of support she's received from around the world, her lawyers said in a statement.	1	2	1		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	And she "regrets and deplores that commercial brands are financially exploiting a situation that began in total good faith, and which should be restricted to the human level beyond business or commercial interests," the statement said.	2	1	2		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	The nonprofit Sancti Spiritus foundation plans to seek a second opinion from art experts on what to do about the painting, before getting the view of lawyers, said foundation president Francisco Miguel Arilla, who is also the mayor of Borja, population about 5,000.				i	3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	"Everyone wants to solve this, but no one knows the solution," Arilla said.	3	2	2		3	
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	While Gimenez could end up with ownership of what she painted on top of the fresco, the foundation isn't sure who owns the original.	2	1	1		3

163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	The influx of visitors hasn't shown any sign of letting up since news of the fresco rocketed around the world, Arrilla said.	1	1	1		3

164	disney-film-show-mary-poppins-flew-book-screen-191928152--finance	LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The tale of how the world's most beloved nanny, Mary Poppins, flew from the pages of a popular book onto the big screen is the subject of a new film starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, Disney said on Wednesday.	2	3	2		4	
164	disney-film-show-mary-poppins-flew-book-screen-191928152--finance	The film called "Saving Mr. Banks" began production on Wednesday.	1	1	1		4	
164	disney-film-show-mary-poppins-flew-book-screen-191928152--finance	It tells of Walt Disney's 20-year pursuit of the film rights to author P.L. Travers' novel "Mary Poppins," Walt Disney Co's movie studio said in a statement.	2	1	1		4	
164	disney-film-show-mary-poppins-flew-book-screen-191928152--finance	Hanks will play Walt Disney, marking the first time the legendary animator and film producer has ever been depicted in a dramatic film.	1	3	1		4

164	disney-film-show-mary-poppins-flew-book-screen-191928152--finance	"Mary Poppins" was released in 1964 and won five Oscars, including a best actress award for Julie Andrews in the title role, best original score and best song for "Chim Chim Cher-ee."	2	4	1		4

165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	SITTWE, Myanmar (AP) — There are no Muslim faithful in most of this crumbling town's main mosques anymore, no Muslim students at its university.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	They're gone from the market, missing from the port, too terrified to walk on just about any street downtown.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Three-and-a-half months after some of the bloodiest clashes in a generation between Myanmar's ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and stateless Muslims known as Rohingya left the western town of Sittwe in flames, nobody is quite sure when — or even if — the Rohingya will be allowed to resume the lives they once lived here.	2	1	4		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	The conflict has fundamentally altered the demographic landscape of this coastal state capital, giving way to a disturbing policy of government-backed segregation that contrasts starkly with the democratic reforms Myanmar's leadership has promised the world since half a century of military rule ended last year.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	While the Rakhine can move freely, some 75,000 Rohingya have effectively been confined to a series of rural displaced camps outside Sittwe and a single downtown district they dare not leave for fear of being attacked.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	For the town's Muslim population, it's a life of exclusion that's separate, and anything but equal.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"We're living like prisoners here," said Thant Sin, a Rohingya shopkeeper who has been holed up since June in the last Rohingya-dominated quarter of central Sittwe that wasn't burned down.	2	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Too afraid to leave, the 47-year-old cannot work anyway.	2	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	The blue wooden doors of his shuttered pharmaceutical stall sit abandoned inside the city's main market — a place only Rakhine are now allowed to enter.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	The crisis in western Myanmar goes back decades and is rooted in a highly controversial dispute over where the region's Muslim inhabitants are really from.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Although many Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations, they are widely denigrated here as foreigners — intruders who came from neighboring Bangladesh to steal scarce land.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	The U.N. estimates their number at 800,000.	1	1	1		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	But the government does not count them as one of the country's 135 ethnic groups, and so — like Bangladesh — denies them citizenship.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Human rights groups say racism also plays a role: Many Rohingya, who speak a distinct Bengali dialect and resemble Muslim Bangladeshis, have darker skin and are heavily discriminated against.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	In late May, tensions boiled over after the rape and murder of a Rakhine woman, allegedly by three Rohingya, in a town south of Sittwe.	2	1	5		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	By mid-June, skirmishes between rival mobs carrying swords, spears and iron rods erupted across the region.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Conservative estimates put the death toll at around 100 statewide, with 5,000 homes burned along with dozens of mosques and monasteries.	1	1	4		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Sittwe suffered more damage than most, and today blackened tracts of rubble-strewn land filled with knotted tree stumps are scattered everywhere.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	The largest tract, called Narzi, once was home to 10,000 Muslims.	1	1	1		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Human Rights Watch accused security forces of colluding with Rakhine mobs at the height of the mayhem, opening fire on Rohingya even as they struggled to douse the flames of their burning homes.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Speaking to a delegation of visiting American diplomats earlier this month, Border Affairs Minister Lt. Gen. Thein Htay described Sittwe's new status quo.	1	1	1		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Drawing his finger across a city map, he said there are now "lines that cannot be crossed" by either side, or else "there will be aggression ... there will be disputes."	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"It's not what we want," he added with a polite smile.	2	1	1		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"But this is the reality we face."	2	1	1		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	While police and soldiers are protecting mosques and guarding Rohingya in camps, there is much they cannot control.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	One group of 300 local Buddhist leaders, for example, issued pamphlets urging the Rakhine not to do business with the Rohingya or even talk to them.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	It is the only way, they say, to avert violence.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Inside Sittwe's once mixed municipal hospital, a separate ward has been established to serve Muslim patients only; on a recent day, it was filled with just four patients whose families said they could only get there with police escorts.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	At the town's university, only Rakhine now attend.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	And at the main market, plastic identity cards are needed to enter: pink for shopkeepers, yellow for customers, none for Rohingya.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	The crisis has posed one of the most serious challenges yet to Thein Sein's nascent government, which declared a state of emergency and warned the unrest could threaten the country's nascent transition toward democracy if it spread.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Although the clashes have been contained and an independent commission has been appointed to study the conflict and recommend solutions, the government has shown little political will to go further.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	The Rohingya are a deeply unpopular cause in Myanmar, where even opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and former political prisoners imprisoned by the army have failed to speak out on their behalf.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	In July, Thein Sein himself suggested the Rohingya should be sent to any other country willing to take them.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"In that context, we're seeing them segregated into squalid camps, fleeing the country, and in some cases being rounded up and imprisoned," said Matthew Smith, a researcher for Human Rights Watch who authored a recent report for the New York-based group on the latest unrest.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	In places like Sittwe, "there is a risk of permanent segregation," Smith said.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"None of this bodes well for the prospects of a multi-ethnic democracy."	2	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	In the meantime, the government's own statistics indicate the crisis is worsening — at least for the Rohingya.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	While the total number of displaced Rakhine statewide has declined from about 24,000 at the start of the crisis to 5,600 today, the number of displaced Rohingya has risen from 52,000 to 70,000, mostly in camps just outside Sittwe.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	The government has blamed the rise on Rohingya it says didn't lose homes but who are eager to gain access to aid handouts.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Insecurity is also likely a factor, though.	2	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Amnesty International has accused authorities of detaining hundreds of Rohingya in a post-conflict crackdown aimed almost exclusively at Muslims.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	And in August, 3,500 people were displaced after new clashes saw nearly 600 homes burned in the town of Kyauktaw, according to the U.N.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Elsewhere in Rakhine state, the army has resumed forced labor against Muslims, ordering villagers to cultivate the military's paddy fields, act as porters and rebuild destroyed homes, according to a report by the Arakan Project, an activist group.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	In Sittwe, mutual fear and distrust runs so high that most of the 7,000 Rohingya crammed inside a dilapidated quarter called Aung Mingalar have not set foot outside it since June.	2	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	It's the last Muslim-inhabited block downtown, a tiny place that takes about five minutes to cross by foot.	1	1	1		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Thant Sin, the Rohingya shopkeeper who lives in Aung Mingalar, said the government delivers rice but getting almost everything else requires exorbitant bribes and connections.	1	2	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	There is just one mosque.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	There are no clinics, medical care or schools, and Thant Sin is worried his savings will run out in weeks.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	The married father of five has been unable to open his market stall since authorities ordered it shut three months ago.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	One told him, "This for the Rakhine now," he recalled.	2	1	1		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"All we want to do is go back to work," he said.	2	1	1		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"The government is doing nothing to help us get our lives back."	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	All four roads into Aung Mingalar are guarded by police, and outside, past the roadblocks of barbed wire and wood that divide the district from the rest of town, Rakhine walk freely — sometimes yelling racial slurs or hurling stones from slingshots.	1	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Across the street, a 57-year-old Rakhine, Aye Myint, leaned back in a rusted metal chair and peered at a group of bearded Muslim men in Aung Mingalar.	1	1	1		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"I feel nothing for those people now," he said.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"After what happened ... they cannot be trusted anymore.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	To tell the truth, we want them out of here."	2	1			4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Hla Thain, the attorney general of Rakhine state, denied there was any official policy of forced segregation, saying security forces are deployed to protect both sides, not keep them apart.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	But he acknowledged that there were not enough police or soldiers to make the two communities feel safe, and that huge obstacles to reconciliation remain.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"We want them to live together, that is our goal, but we can't force people to change," he said.	1	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"Anger is still running high.	2	1	3		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Neither side can forget that they lost family members, their homes."	2	1	4		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	For now, he said, the government is studying every possibility to make life "normal" again.	2	2	1		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	For example: having Rakhine students attend university in the morning, while Rohingya go each afternoon.	1	1	1		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	Thein Htay, the border minister, was more blunt.	2	1	2		4	
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	"We may have to build another market center, another trading center, another port" for the Rohingya, he said, because it will be "very difficult otherwise."	2	1	2		4

168	does-offering-kids-sips-alcohol-turn-them-boozy-104600662	Most parents are anxious to steer their kids away from drug and alcohol abuse. But what's the best way to do it? A new study by public health analyst Christine Jackson of the research institute RTI International, along with colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, found that an unexpectedly high number of mom and dads think they can avoid raising kids who become irresponsible drinkers by exposing them to small amounts of alcohol — a sip of beer, a little wine — at a young age. Is that really a good idea? Here, a brief guide:	2	2	2			
168	does-offering-kids-sips-alcohol-turn-them-boozy-104600662	How many parents believe in introducing their kids to booze in tiny increments?Jackson and her fellow researchers surveyed 1,000 mothers and their third-grade children in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and found that 40 percent of moms believed that forbidding alcohol would only make their kids more rebellious. One-fifth of the moms believed the occasional sip of wine or beer at dinner would "help inoculate young kids against the lurking dangers of peer pressure," says Doug Barry at Jezebel, making them less drawn to experimenting with risky, heavy drinking in their teen years.	2	2	3

168	does-offering-kids-sips-alcohol-turn-them-boozy-104600662	Are these parents actually giving their young kids booze?Many are, according to Jackson. One-third of the third graders the study examined had already tried beer, wine, or, in some cases, even hard liquor. The study suggests that their parents — at least, those who know about the drinking — think the kids will take the responsible drinking habits they learn at home, under mom and dad's watchful eyes, out into the world. Not so fast, health experts warn.	2	2	3			
168	does-offering-kids-sips-alcohol-turn-them-boozy-104600662	What does early drinking really do to kids?Numerous studies over the last several years have found that "early-onset" drinking is a "known primary risk factor for problem drinking during adolescence," the researchers write. And remember, teenage brains have underdeveloped "brakes," making teens more likely to mimic their peers' dangerous behavior when partying, rather than the moderate drinking styles of parents at the dinner table.	1	1	3

168	does-offering-kids-sips-alcohol-turn-them-boozy-104600662	So what's a mom or dad to do?"Try and delay exposure to alcohol for as long as possible," says Ralph Hingson, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's Division of Epidemiology and Prevention Research. Jackson says even a few sips could be enough to put a kid at risk, although some health experts aren't so sure. The most important factor is "the age at which kids first get drunk," says Tim Stockwell, director of Canada's Center for Addictions Research of British Columbia. "That predicted far more than the age at which they first had a drink and I'm thinking that would apply to a sip. All the worries about alcohol are not about sipping."	1	1	3

171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Dolan says Dish had been happy with Voom HD channels	2	2	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp founder Charles Dolan testified on Monday that it was "quite a reversal" when Dish Network Corp abruptly ended their contract for high-definition programming, a dispute at the center of a long-running legal feud between the two pay TV providers.	3	1	3		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Dolan, Cablevision's billionaire chairman, was the first witness in the trial in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.	1	1	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Voom HD, a former Cablevision unit, sued Dish in 2008, saying Dish violated a 15-year deal to carry HD programming and should pay $2.4 billion in damages.	3	1	3		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Dish has countered that Cablevision did not invest the $100 million per year in the service it had promised.	3	1	3		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Voom HD is now a part of AMC Networks, which Cablevision spun out last year.	1	1	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Dish blocked AMC, the company behind critically acclaimed shows such as "Mad Men" and "Breaking Bad," as well as the IFC, WE and Sundance channels from its 14 million customers in July.	1	2	2		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Media analysts say the trial's outcome could decide whether Dish ever carries the channels again.	3	2	2		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen is expected to testify later in the trial, which is likely to run about a month.	3	1	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Dolan's son, James, who is Cablevision's chief executive and the owner of the New York Knicks basketball team, had also been expected to testify, but a source close to the case who declined to be identified said on Monday he likely will not take the stand.	3	1	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Dolan, who turns 86 this month and rarely speaks in public, testified that he was not aware of Dish being anything less than satisfied with Cablevision's Voom HD programming package.	2	2	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	He said he could recall only one criticism that Ergen had with the programming: he did not like a channel called "Rave" that played rock concerts.	3	1	2		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Dolan said it was known that Ergen dislikes rock music so this did not surprise anyone at Cablevision.	3	2	2		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	In all of his meetings with Ergen, Dolan said the Dish executive was always upbeat and optimistic the HD channels would be successful and Dish even took a 20 percent stake in the venture.	3	4	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	"We had repeated meetings ... Definitely, (Ergen) was interested ...	3	3	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	He appreciated the programming," Dolan said.	3	3	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Dolan also testified that it had been his idea for Cablevision to invest $100 million per year, or half a billion dollars over five years, in Voom HD.	2	2	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	A key question for the jury will be whether Cablevision spent $100 million a year on the service.	2	1	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Dish has said that the $100 million clause in the contract pertained to money spent on TV programming only, and because Dish only spent $60 million in this area, the No. 2 satellite provider was allowed to terminate the agreement.	3	2	2		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Cablevision said that it spent more than $100 million per year on the service, including marketing and overhead costs, as it promised.	3	2	2		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	When asked what the Voom budget had been earmarked for, Dolan said it was widely known that the money would be used on the entire Voom HD business, which included overhead, marketing and salaries.	3	2	1		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	Dolan said Dish broke its 15-year contract with Voom HD to pay it $3.25 per subscriber for the channels in 2008, around the same time that other popular networks such as ESPN began offering HD feeds for free.	3	1	3		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	This made Cablevision "cynical" about Dish's motives in ending the contract, Dolan said.	3	1	3		4	
171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	"Charlie was realizing he could sell (HD channels) without paying us," Dolan said, referring to Ergen.	3	1	3		4

178	driveable-15th-could-prove-pivotal-ryder-cup-174155699--golf	The hole has been shortened 100 yards since Medinah hosted the 2006 PGA Championship and a pond was placed along the right side of the fairway and green to offer a risk-reward option.	1	1	1

178	driveable-15th-could-prove-pivotal-ryder-cup-174155699--golf	"I think it's an easy birdie laying up, and as disappointing as the fans are going to be to see that, we have to play what's there in front of us and try to shoot the lowest score," Phil Mickelson said.

178	driveable-15th-could-prove-pivotal-ryder-cup-174155699--golf	Players expect easier chips from off the green and with some 400 trees cut down last winter, openings could allow them to recover from wayward tee shots in spectacular fashion.	1	2	1

178	driveable-15th-could-prove-pivotal-ryder-cup-174155699--golf	Watson, a master at shaping approach shots, applauded the set-up.	2	2	1

180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Earth-Sun Distance Measurement Redefined	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	One of the stalwart units of astronomy just got a makeover.	2	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	The International Astronomical Union, the authority on astronomical constants, has voted unanimously to redefine the astronomical unit, the conventional unit of length based on the distance between the Earth and the sun.	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	"The new definition is much simpler than the old one," says Sergei Klioner of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, one of a group of scientists who worked decades toward the change, which took effect last month during an IAU meeting	3	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Under the new definition, the astronomical unit (or AU) — the measurement used for the Earth-sun distance — is no longer always in flux, depending on the length of a day and other changing factors.	2	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	It is now a fixed number: 149,597,870,700 meters, which is the equivalent of almost 92.956 million miles.	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Klioner explained the simpler definition is helpful, for instance, for scientists who formulate ephemerides — tables that give the precise position of astronomical objects in the sky.	2	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	They utilize the astronomical unit to calculate the motion of bodies in the solar system.	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	[Solar System Explained From the Inside Out (Infographic)]				I	4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	"The broader community of astronomers are able now to better, with less efforts, understand what their colleagues — astronomers who are experts in planetary ephemerides — do and how they produce the high-accuracy theories of motion in the solar system," he told SPACE.com by email.	3	3	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	The revision also makes the unit easier for engineers, software designers and students to understand, Klioner and his colleague Nicole Capitaine, of Paris Observatory, noted.	3	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	At the same time, the redefinition can serves an epitaph to the bygone era when Earth-bound scientists depended on viewing angles to calculate celestial distances.	2	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	An established unit	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Lacking precise instrumentation, early astronomers relied heavily on angles to calculate the size of the universe.	1	1	2		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	By studying Mars from two separate points on Earth, 17th-century Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini was able to use trigonometry to calculate the distance from Earth to the sun with only about a 6 percent error.	2	2	2		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	"Expressing distances in the astronomical unit allowed astronomers to overcome the difficulty of measuring distances in some physical unit," Capitaine told SPACE.com by email.	3	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	"Such a practice was useful for many years, because astronomers were not able to make distance measurements in the solar system as precisely as they could measure angles."	3	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Modern instruments can come within a few meters of exactly determining distances of over 150 million meters, or some 93,000 miles.	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	The astronomical unit eventually came to be defined by a mathematical expression that involved the mass of the sun, the length of a day, and a fixed number known as the Gaussian gravitational constant.	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Because the Earth orbits its star in an ellipse rather than a circle, the length of a day shifts over the course of a year.	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	At the same time, the sun is constantly transforming mass into energy.	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	In the 20th century, famed scientist Albert Einstein added general relativity to the mix.	2	3	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	According to the famous theory, space-time is relative depending on one's frame of reference.	2	3	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	The new fixed number is the best estimate of the original expression, Klioner said.	2	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	"If we would decide to continue with the old definition, we would have to add several additional conventions to make the latter meaningful in the framework of general relativity," he explained.	3	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	"A better way was to change the definition completely — and this is what we succeeded in doing."	3	3	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Capitaine said, "The change of definition of the astronomical unit mainly concerns those in the field of high-accuracy solar system dynamics."	3	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Satellites and other crafts traveling in space are not affected, because they rely on set distances.	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	"The distance between the Earth and the sun, as any physical distance, should be measured and cannot be fixed by any sort of resolution," Klioner said.	3	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	The times, they are a-changing	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Capitaine and Klioner are among several scientists who worked over the last two decades on a revision of the astronomical unit.	2	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Capitaine said she first got involved when she gave a presentation in 1994 with Bernard Guinot, also of Paris Observatory.	2	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Over the course of 10 years, several published papers by various scientists discussed the ramifications of changing the stalwart unit.	2	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	The three scientists presented the issue to the astronomical community on a number of different occasions.	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Other astronomers helped to demonstrate the feasibility of the change before it landed on the table of one of the working groups for the International Astronomical Union.	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	The resolution was reworked several times before it won unanimous passage.	1	1	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	"The change as we have it now is really a product of collective work," Klioner said.	2	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	He went on to add, "I think that the energy, commitment, and the worldwide scientific reputation of Nicole Capitaine were crucial for getting this change through."	3	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Shifting from a constantly changing value to a fixed number may seem like an easy choice, but the group faced some resistance.	2	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Some believed that the overhaul would be too difficult to implement with crucial software, while others were concerned that discrepancies might be introduced into past work.	2	1	2		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Still others were uncomfortable changing such a historic definition.	2	1	2		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	Eventually, all concerns were apparently met.	2	2	1		4	
180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	"Within the last two years, I have not heard a single objection for the change itself," Klioner said.	2	2	1		4

182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com)	1	1	1	S	4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	- Ed Zwick ("The Last Samurai") has fallen off directing duties for the historic epic "The Great Wall," an individual close to the project told to TheWrap on Monday, adding that there was a difference in visions on how to move forward on the project between Zwick and the producers, Legendary East.	3	1	2	S	4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	Legendary East is pushing ahead with the project, however, and seeking a new director to replace Zwick.	2	1	1		4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	A decision was made earlier this summer to push the start date of the project from the fall to the spring to avoid adverse weather conditions, and there was some speculation about the future of the project.	1	1	1		4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	But financing remains in place for the film, the individual said, and it is moving forward.	1	1	1		4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	Zwick has not yet responded to TheWrap's requests for comment.	1	1	1		4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	Earlier this year, casting was announced, with a starring lineup that included Henry Cavill and Benjamin Walker.	1	1	1		4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	Chinese stars such as Zhang Ziyi are also reportedly being courted for the film.	1	1	1		4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	The original lineup of producers for the film included Legendary's Thomas Tull and Jon Jashni, Charles Roven and Alex Gartner of Atlas Entertainment, as well as Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz.	1	1	1		4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	It was unclear at press time if Zwick and Herskovitz would still function as producers.	3	1	1		4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	The first film for Legendary East, the film is set in 15th century China and follows a group of British warriors who happen upon the wall as it is under construction.	1	1	1		4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	They soon begin to realize that there is more to it than meets the eye.	2	1	1		4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	"The Great Wall" was announced as the first film for Legendary East, a stand-alone company, which is based in Hong Kong and staffed with Chinese employees.	1	1	1		4	
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	At the end of last year, Legendary East terminated a distribution agreement with the Chinese group, the Huayi Brothers, which was due to distribute "The Great Wall" in China.	1	1	1		4

183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	New York Times columnist David Brooks is the Eddie Haskell of the Fourth Estate.	1	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Like the two-faced sycophant in "Leave It to Beaver," Brooks indulges in excessive politeness while currying favor with political authority.	2	2	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	He prides himself on an oily semblance of maturity and rational discourse.	3	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	But the phony "conservative" back-stabber, who has spent the last four years slavering over Barack Obama like a One Direction groupie and trashing the tea party like an MSNBC junkie, isn't fooling anyone.	4	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Lately, Brooks has been given to dispensing passive-aggressive advice to GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney.	3	1	2		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	His column this week titled "Thurston Howell Romney" called Romney "a kind, decent man" — and then shredded him to pieces as a "country club" elitist who "doesn't know much about the culture of America," "knows nothing about ambition and motivation," and is "running a depressingly inept presidential campaign."	4	2	3		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Eddie Haskell Brooks, along with fellow GOP bubble-dwellers Peggy Noonan and Bill Kristol, eagerly piled on Romney over his "secret video" remarks contrasting the nation's makers and takers.	3	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Liberal outlets embraced these chin-pulling tools — elevating them as "key" Republican voices who speak for the right.	3	2	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Despite the best efforts of the Democratic-professional media complex to gin up faux-rage over Romney's remarks, however, several polls show that voters agree with Romney's fundamental critique of the indulgent Democratic politics of victimhood, identity and dependency.	3	2	2		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Yep, Brooks has the pulse of mainstream America — direct from his hallowed bubble at the Fishwrap of Record.	4	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Brooks shares all he knows about "ambition," "motivation" and the "culture of America" through regular appearances with the insular clique of conservative-bashing snobs at taxpayer-supported "PBS NewsHour."	2	2	2		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	A cursory glance at Brooks' biography shows that he has spent the majority of his life in New York City and Washington, D.C.	2	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	He has worked for a raft of employers from The Washington Times to The Wall Street Journal to The Weekly Standard to The New York Times.	2	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	But unlike Romney, Brooks has never actually run a business of his own, managed a massive private entity, governed a state or overseen a campaign for national office.	3	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	He does have quite an impressive record, though.	3	2	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	If by record you mean sucking up to empty suit Barack Obama, mocking grass-roots conservatives as "teens" and defending his cocktail party mates in establishment journalism.	4	1	2		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	In 2009, the liberal New Republic published the bodice-ripping "story behind the Obama-Brooks bromance."	2	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	The magazine reported that "two days after Obama's 'The Audacity of Hope' hit bookstores (in 2006), Brooks published a glowing Times column.	2	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	The headline was 'Run, Barack, Run.'"	1	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Brooks also recounted his first encounter with his Democratic crush.	2	2	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	"I remember distinctly an image of — we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant," Brooks said, "and I'm thinking, a) he's going to be president and b) he'll be a very good president."	3	2	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	The purported conservative columnist's public display of affection for the radical Democratic candidate bordered on obscene.	4	1	2		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	"I think he's more talented than anyone in my lifetime," Brooks gushed.	3	2	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	"I mean, he is pretty dazzling when he walks into a room."	4	2	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Brooks revealed that he considered Obama's Chicago campaign mastermind David Axelrod a "hero."	3	2	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Axelrod returned the love, calling Brooks a "serious public thinker" in an era of "insipid, instant commentary and one-hour news cycles."	3	2	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	In the fall of 2008, Brooks swooned over Obama's Ivy League "achievatrons" taking over Washington: "Already the culture of the Obama administration is coming into focus.	3	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Its members are twice as smart as the poor reporters who have to cover them, three times if you include the columnists.	4	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	They typically served in the Clinton administration and then, like Cincinnatus, retreated to the comforts of private life — that is, if Cincinnatus had worked at Goldman Sachs, Williams & Connolly or the Brookings Institution."	2	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Wait, he wasn't not done:	3	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	"So many of them send their kids to Georgetown Day School, the posh leftish private school in D.C., that they'll be able to hold White House staff meetings in the carpool line.	3	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	And yet as much as I want to resent these overeducated Achievatrons (not to mention the incursion of a French-style government dominated by highly trained Enarchs), I find myself tremendously impressed by the Obama transition."	4	2	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Less than three years later, Brooks acknowledged he had been an "Obama sap."	2	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	He admitted that he fell for the administration's stimulus propaganda:	2	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	"When administration officials called around saying that the possibility of a double-dip recession was horrifyingly real and that it would be irresponsible not to come up with a package that could pass right away, I believed them.	3	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	... But of course I'm a sap.	4	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	When the president unveiled the second half of his stimulus it became clear that this package has nothing to do with helping people right away or averting a double dip.	3	1	2		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	This is a campaign marker, not a jobs bill."	3	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Not just a sap.	3	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	A willing tool, too.	3	1	1		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Brooks copped to sitting on Obama's private admission to him that the "shovel-ready" promise was a crock.	3	1	2		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	"The projects just didn't exist.	3	1	2		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	They couldn't do it.	3	1	3		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	They couldn't find them," he said on "PBS NewsHour" — more than a year after Obama told him.	2	1	2		4	
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	Gee, Wally, why isn't Eddie Haskell Brooks giving this corrupt administration and its Titanically inept "achievatrons" the business?	4	1	2		4

184	egypt-3-sentenced-morality-killing-164353185	CAIRO (AP) — An Egyptian court has convicted three Islamists of killing a student this summer as he sat in a quiet park with his fiancée, sentencing them to 15 years in prison in a case that sparked fears of vigilantes trying to enforce strict religious mores.	2	1	4		4	
184	egypt-3-sentenced-morality-killing-164353185	The state-owned Middle East News Agency said the Tuesday verdict was read out in a heavily-guarded courtroom in the Red Sea city of Suez, where 20-year-old Ahmed Hussein Eid was killed in June.	2	1	4		4	
184	egypt-3-sentenced-morality-killing-164353185	According to security officials at the time, three bearded men argued with Eid for loitering in the park with a woman who was not his wife.	3	1	3		4	
184	egypt-3-sentenced-morality-killing-164353185	One fatally stabbed him.	1	1	4		4	
184	egypt-3-sentenced-morality-killing-164353185	Many in Egypt fear that the rising political power of ultraconservative Islamists will see them flexing their muscles on the streets as well.	2	1	4		4	
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	Egypt TV presenter in incitement trial arrested	2	1	3			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	CAIRO (AP) — The owner of a TV station on trial for incitement after calling for the killing of Egypt's Islamist president Mohammed Morsi was arrested on Sunday in connection with a series of allegations, including theft of electrical power and issuing a bounced check, police said.	1	1	4			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	Tawfiq Okasha was not at his Cairo home when police went to arrest him, but he later surrendered at a police station in the eastern suburb of Nasr City, they added.	1	1	2			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	Also Sunday, Justice Ministry officials said an investigating judge referred the last prime minister of Egypt's deposed authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak to trial on corruption charges arising from the decade he served as civil aviation minister. Besides Ahmed Shafiq, the chairman of national carrier EgyptAir and nine other ministry officials were also referred to trial.	2	1	3			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	Shafiq left Egypt shortly after his narrow defeat by Morsi in a presidential runoff in June. He has already been referred to trial on separate corruption charges dating back to the 1990s when he chaired a housing association for air force officers. Mubarak's two sons, onetime heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa, were charged in the same case together with four retired generals.	2	1	2			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	Shafiq, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, was defiant in a comment he posted on his Twitter account after news of his new trial broke in Cairo.	1	1	2			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	"I will continue my political work and I will stand up to persecution and the use of law to commit character assassination against me," he wrote. "I traveled after the election to avoid expected persecution. Time has shown that it did happen," wrote Shafiq, who like Mubarak is a career air force officer. He was named prime minister in Mubarak's final days in office.	3	1	3			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	Authorities last month ordered the closure of Okasha's TV station — Al-Faraeen," or "The Pharoahs" — which he used to launch scathing attacks on Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood, the fundamentalist Islamist group from which the president hails. Okasha has emerged as one of the most popular TV personalities of post-Mubarak Egypt by railing against the uprising that toppled Mubarak's 29-year rule in February 2011.	2	1	3			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	For months, he appeared on Al-Faraeen every night to mock the country's "enemies" — everyone from leftists and Islamists to Freemasons and Zionists — with rants full of abuse and earthy humor. In the weeks before a court ordered his station closed, he presented himself as Egypt's champion against a takeover by the Brotherhood, starting an open clash with the group and the new president.	3	2	3			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	It was not immediately clear why authorities decided to move against Okasha now since most Egyptians, particularly celebrities like him, get away with a fine when faced with similar charges. Okasha, according to the police officials, was also arrested over allegations of forgery and disturbing authorities.	1	1	3			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	No details were immediately available on the particulars of the charges.	1	1	2			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	The police and Justice Ministry officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.	1	1	1			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	Okasha is not the only media personality facing criminal charges related to attacks on Morsi or his Brotherhood.	2	1	3			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	The editor of the el-Dustour newspaper, which vilifies Morsi daily, is on trial for "spreading lies" and fabricating news. A Christian man is also serving a two-year prison sentence for insulting Morsi.	4	1	4			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	There are widespread worries among Egyptians that Morsi and the Brotherhood have amassed too much power, holding executive and legislative authorities as well as dominating the process of writing the next constitution.	3	1	2			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	But Okasha does not get much sympathy because many of the nation's key political players see him as a divisive figure. Many secular politicians and activists who distrust the Brotherhood shun him, seeing him as a remnant of Mubarak's authoritarian regime.	2	1	2			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	Some see the crackdown on Okasha and Shafiq as a move by Morsi to eliminate a powerful potential rival in Shafiq, and a vocal critic in Okasha. Like in the days of Mubarak, Morsi's presidential palace maintains that the president has nothing to do with legal procedures against critics like Okasha or the el-Dustour editor.	3	1	3			
185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	Veteran politician Ayman Nour was jailed on forgery charges soon after he finished a distant second in a 2005 presidential election, the only vote where Mubarak allowed someone besides himself to appear on the ballot. Shortly afterward, the politician who finished third lost the leadership of his party in a power struggle suspected to have been engineered by Mubarak's security agents.	1	1	3

186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Egypt's new President Mohammed Morsi assigned himself the heavyweight's role in the Middle East on Wednesday, declaring in his first speech to the United Nations that the civil war raging in Syria is the "tragedy of the age" and must be brought to an end.	3	1	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	In a wide-ranging address that touched on all major issues confronting the region, Morsi also decried Israeli settlement-building on territory Palestinians claim for a future state and condemned a film produced in the United States that denigrates Islam's Prophet Muhammad.	4	2	4		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	He urged all U.N. member nations to join in an effort to end what he called "the catastrophe in Syria" that pits the regime of Bashar Assad against opposition forces trying to end 40 years of dictatorship.	3	1	4		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	More than 30,000 people have been killed in the 18-month conflict.	1	1	5		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Morsi has called for Assad to step down and said Wednesday that "the bloodshed in Syria and the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded must be stopped."	3	1	4		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Morsi, an Islamist and key member of the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood, opened his remarks to the U.N. General Assembly by celebrating himself as Egypt's first democratically elected leader who was swept into office after what he called a "great, peaceful revolution" that overthrew Hosni Mubarak.	3	3	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	He then quickly inserted himself into the thorniest issues in the Middle East, demanding that the United Nations grant membership to the Palestinians, with or without a peace agreement with Israel.	3	2	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	"The fruits of dignity and freedom must not remain far from the Palestinian people," he said, adding that it was "shameful" that U.N. resolutions are not enforced.	3	1	4		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	The Palestinians are expected to again ask for U.N. recognition and formally make application to the world body in November, after the U.S. presidential election.	1	1	1		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	President Barack Obama said when the Palestinians sought recognition last year that Washington would block the move until there was a peace deal with Israel.	2	2	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	The focus of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which have been on hold for four years, is a two-state solution that would formally grant the Palestinians the rights of an independent country.	1	2	1		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	In his bid to end the violence in Syria, Morsi has invited Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia to join a contact group, though the Saudis have not yet participated and the fighting in Syria continues unabated.	1	2	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	While Morsi wants Assad to step aside, he said Wednesday that he opposes any foreign military intervention.	2	1	1		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	The U.N. Security Council, which could call for intervention or global sanctions against Syria, is deadlocked because Russia, Assad's main protector, and China have blocked a series of resolutions brought by Western governments.	2	1	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Morsi also denounced as an obscenity the anti-Islam video that portrays the Prophet Muhammad as a womanizer, a child molester and a fraud, insisting that freedom of expression does not allow for attacks on any religion.	3	1	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	He also condemned the violence that swept Muslim countries last week in reaction to the video.	3	1	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	At least 51 people were killed, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans targeted in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.	1	1	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	"Egypt respects freedom of expression.	3	2	1		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	One that is not used to incite hatred against anyone.	3	2	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	One that is not directed toward one specific religion or culture.	3	2	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	A freedom of expression that tackles extremism and violence.	3	3	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Not the freedom of expression that deepens ignorance and disregards others," Morsi said.	3	1	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	He appeared to have been responding to Obama's General Assembly speech Tuesday in which the U.S. leader again condemned the video but sternly defended the U.S. Constitution's free speech guarantees.	3	1	1		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	In Cairo, Egyptians watched Morsi's speech closely for signs of how he would conduct his presidency.	2	1	1		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Abdel-Mohsen, a 31-year architect, praised Morsi's condemnation of the Assad regime, but questioned his assertions about free speech.	3	2	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	"How can he talk about freedom of expression when there are many protesters in detention in Egypt, including minors, and when people are locked up for the so-called contempt of religion?"	3	1	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	she said.				S	4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	The head of the Arab League, meanwhile, called for the international community to criminalize blasphemy, warning that insults to religion pose a serious threat to global peace and security.	1	1	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Nabil Elaraby's comments to a special session of the U.N. Security Council put him at direct odds with the United States and its Western allies, which are resolutely opposed to restrictions on freedom of expression.	2	3	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	However, Elaraby said that if the West has criminalized acts that result in bodily harm, it must also criminalize acts that cause "psychological and spiritual harm."	3	2	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Earlier Wednesday, Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, known for past fiery denunciations of the United States and Israel, spoke at length about his vision for a new world order without the "hegemony of arrogance."	4	1	4		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Of Israel, he cited what he termed the "continued threat by the uncivilized Zionists to resort to military action against our great nation."	4	2	4		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	The U.S. delegation boycotted Ahmadinejad's speech in response to the "paranoid theories and repulsive slurs against Israel" included in a separate address delivered by the Iranian president on Monday.	2	1	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	"It's particularly unfortunate that Mr. Ahmadinejad will have the platform of the U.N. General Assembly on Yom Kippur, which is why the United States has decided not to attend," Erin Pelton, spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission to the U.N., said in a statement.	2	2	4		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Thousands of protesters in yellow vests emblazoned with photos of Iranian dissidents they said were killed by the Iranian regime gathered outside U.N. headquarters during the Iranian leader's speech.	2	1	4		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Speakers included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-NY, and former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.	1	1	1		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	In his speech on Wednesday, Ahmadinejad did not refer to Iran's nuclear program.	1	1	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Israel and Western nations contend that Tehran is using what it insists is a peaceful nuclear program as a cover for developing the ability to build atomic weapons.	2	2	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Tough sanctions have been imposed on Iran as punishment for its failure to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency to prove the peaceful nature of its drive to enrich uranium to levels that could be used to build a nuclear weapon.	2	1	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Israel has threatened a military strike against Iranian nuclear installations, but Obama insists there is still time to solve the dispute through diplomacy.	2	2	3		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	He has vowed, however, to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear arsenal.	2	3	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	Outside the U.N., Alex Mohammed, 40, a restaurant manager from Chicago, stood next to a mock jail cell with a noose next to it, and a cartoon of Ahmadinejad standing under a series of hanged Iranians' legs and the inscription: "We don't have political prisoners in Iran — anymore."	3	1	2		4	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	"It's getting worse in Iran, because the dictator is taking away more freedoms, including freedom of speech, and jailing journalists," said Mohammed, who has family in Tehran.	3	1	4		4

187	egypts-mursi-appoints-intelligence-chief-154646540	CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt President Mohamed Mursi appointed a new national intelligence chief on Wednesday to replace Mourad Mwafi, who was sent into retirement after an attack that left 16 border guards dead in Sinai last month.	1	1	2		4	
187	egypts-mursi-appoints-intelligence-chief-154646540	Mohamed Shehata, already named as Mwafi's temporary replacement following the August 5 attack, was given the post on a permanent basis, the president said in a statement.	1	1	1		4	
187	egypts-mursi-appoints-intelligence-chief-154646540	The decision to retire Mwafi was seen by many as a major step to entrench Mursi's power after he took office on June 30.	2	1	1		4	
187	egypts-mursi-appoints-intelligence-chief-154646540	Mursi's election win ended more than a year of interim army rule that followed the overthrow of president and former air force commander Hosni Mubarak.	1	1	1		4

188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Egypt's new President Mohammed Morsi debuts at the United Nations on Wednesday with a speech that will be closely watched by world leaders for clues about his democratic intentions and plans for lifting his country out of crippling poverty.	2	1	2			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	Morsi, an Islamist and key figure in the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood, is the first democratically elected leader of the ancient land at the heart of the Arab world, and was sworn in June 30.	3	2	1			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	He is one of a pair of Arab leaders who will be making their first appearances at the U.N. General Assembly's annual ministerial meeting after being swept into power in the Arab Spring revolutions. Also taking the podium will be Yemen's President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who took office in February after more than a year of political turmoil and is now trying to steer the country's transition to democracy.	1	2	2			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	The Egyptian leader previewed his General Assembly remarks in a speech delivered Tuesday at former President Bill Clinton's Global Initiative. Addressing the violence that raged across the Muslim world in response to a video produced in the U.S. that denigrated Islam's Prophet Muhammad, Morsi said freedom of expression must come with "responsibility."	1	1	3			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	He appeared to have been responding to President Barack Obama's General Assembly speech earlier Tuesday in which the U.S. leader again condemned the video but sternly defended the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of free speech.	2	1	2			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	At least 51 people were killed in violence that erupted last week in Muslim countries, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans targeted in an attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.	1	1	4			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	Morsi did not explain what limitations he felt should be placed on free speech but said the video and the violent reaction to it demanded "reflection." He said freedom of expression must be linked with responsibility, "especially when it comes with serious implications for international peace and stability."	2	1	3			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, known for past fiery denunciations of the United States and Israel, will be making his last speech at the world body as he finishes a second and last term as president.	1	1	1			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	Ahmadinejad took aim at both the United States and Israel while addressing a high-level U.N. meeting promoting the rule of law Monday, accusing Washington of shielding what he called a nuclear-armed "fake regime." His remarks prompted a walkout by Israel's U.N. Ambassador Ron Prosor.	2	1	3			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	And in an Associated Press interview Tuesday, the Iranian leader pressed his argument against the United States.	1	1	2			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	"God willing, a new order will come together and we'll do away with everything that distances us," Ahmadinejad said. "Now even elementary school kids throughout the world have understood that the United States government is following an international policy of bullying." He said, "Bullying must come to an end. Occupation must come to an end."	2	1	3			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	Also Wednesday members of the U.N. Security Council will be called to order at an open ministerial meeting by Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, whose country holds the council's rotating presidency, to discuss "change in the Arab world."	1	1	1			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	With no sign of an end to the Security Council's paralysis over intervening to end the raging Syrian civil war, Germany's U.N. Ambassador Peter Wittig said his country chose to focus the council's ministerial session on something new and positive in the Mideast — "the emergence of the Arab League as a regional actor that has proved to be essential for conflict resolution."	2	2	3			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	The 21-member Arab League has shaken off decades of near total submission to the will of the region's leaders and is seeking to transform itself after the seismic changes brought about by the Arab Spring. The league has supported the rebels who ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and suspended Syria in response to President BasharAssad's brutal crackdown against his opponents.	3	2	4			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	"This organization is promoting the values that the United Nations is standing for — human rights, rule of law, democracy, pluralism," the fight against corruption and promoting economic opportunity, Wittig said.	1	3	1			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	Also Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the African Union and France have called a ministerial meeting on unrest in Africa's Sahel region. It will spotlight the worsening security and humanitarian situation in northern Mali, which fell to al-Qaeda-linked Islamists after a March coup.	1	1	3			
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	Mali and a West African bloc are seeking U.N. support for an intervention force that would consist of aerial support and five battalions, or about 3,000 troops, to help recover the northern territory. But the Security Council wants the Economic Community of West African States, known as ECOWAS, to consult more widely, present more detailed proposals, and exhaust all prospects for negotiations. Wittig has said the Mali request will be discussed at a later date.	1	2	2

189	eight-people-arrested-over-benghazi-attack-official-173621608	TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan authorities have arrested eight people in connection with the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in which the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed, a government official said on Friday.	1	1	3			
189	eight-people-arrested-over-benghazi-attack-official-173621608	Libyan officials said last week that four arrests had been made two days after the attack.	1	1	2			
189	eight-people-arrested-over-benghazi-attack-official-173621608	A security official later said Libyan authorities had identified 50 people involved in the assault.	1	1	2

190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	Einstein's brain is now interactive iPad app	1	1	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	CHICAGO (AP) -- The brain that revolutionized physics now can be downloaded as an app for $9.99. But it won't help you win at Angry Birds.	1	2	2			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	While Albert Einstein's genius isn't included, an exclusive iPad application launched Tuesday promises to make detailed images of his brain more accessible to scientists than ever before. Teachers, students and anyone who's curious also can get a look.	2	2	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	A medical museum under development in Chicago obtained funding to scan and digitize nearly 350 fragile and priceless slides made from slices of Einstein's brain after his death in 1955. The application will allow researchers and novices to peer into the eccentric Nobel winner's brain as if they were looking through a microscope.	3	3	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	"I can't wait to find out what they'll discover," said Steve Landers, a consultant for the National Museum of Health and Medicine Chicago who designed the app. "I'd like to think Einstein would have been excited."	2	3	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	After Einstein died, a pathologist named Thomas Harvey performed an autopsy, removing the great man's brain in hopes that future researchers could discover the secrets behind his genius.	1	3	2			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	Harvey gave samples to researchers and collaborated on a 1999 study published in the Lancet. That study showed a region of Einstein's brain — the parietal lobe — was 15 percent wider than normal. The parietal lobe is important to the understanding of math, language and spatial relationships.	1	2	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	The new iPad app may allow researchers to dig even deeper by looking for brain regions where the neurons are more densely connected than normal, said Dr. Phillip Epstein, a Chicago-area neuroscientist and consultant for the museum.	1	2	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	But because the tissue was preserved before modern imaging technology, it may be difficult for scientists to figure out exactly where in Einstein's brain each slide originated. Although the new app organizes the slides into general brain regions, it doesn't map them with precision to an anatomical model.	1	1	2			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	"They didn't have MRI. We don't have a three-dimensional model of the brain of Einstein, so we don't know where the samples were taken from," said researcher Jacopo Annese of the Brain Observatory at the University of California, San Diego. What's more, the 1-inch-by-3-inch Einstein slides on the app represent only a fraction of the entire brain, Annese said.	1	1	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	Annese has preserved and digitized another famous brain, that of Henry Molaison, who died in 2008 after living for decades with profound amnesia. Known as "H.M." in scientific studies, Molaison participated during his life in research that revealed new insights on learning and memory.	1	2	3			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	A searchable website with images of more than 2,400 slides of Molaison's entire brain will be available to the public in December, Annese said.	1	1	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	"There will be another Einstein and we'll do it like H.M.," Annese predicted. For now, he said, it's exciting that the Einstein brain tissue has been preserved digitally before the slides deteriorate or become damaged. The app will spark interest in the field of brain research, just because it's Einstein, he said.	1	2	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	"It's a beautiful collection to have opened up to the public," Annese said.	3	2	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	Some may question whether Einstein would have wanted images of his remains sold to non-scientists for $9.99.	2	1	2			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	"There's been a lot of debate over what Einstein's intentions were," museum board member Jim Paglia said. "We know he didn't want a circus made of his remains. But he understood the value to research and science to study his brain, and we think we've addressed that in a respectful manner."	2	2	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	Paglia said the app could "inspire a whole new generation of neuroscientists."	3	3	1			
190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	Proceeds from sales will go to the U.S. Department of Defense's National Museum of Health and Medicine in Silver Spring, Md., and to the Chicago satellite museum, which is set to open in 2015 with interactive exhibits and the museum's digital collections.	1	1	1

191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	Previously, scientists had confirmed the levels exist by measuring the changes in electric current that result when electrons switch from one Landau level to another.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	However, no one has been able to see these levels until now.	1	2	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	"We are the first to have actually done what's called scanning tunneling microscopy and really look at individual states," said physicist Rudolf Roemer of England's University of Warwick.	2	2	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	Roemer was a member of the research team, led by Koichi Hashimoto of Japan's Tohoku University, that reported the achievement in a paper published in the Sept. 14 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters.	2	2	1

191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	When charged particles, such as electrons, are put inside a magnetic field, they travel along curved paths, ultimately making a circle.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	As the magnetic field gets stronger and stronger, these circles get smaller and smaller.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	The smallest possible circles for the electrons to travel in are the Landau levels.	1	1	1

191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	To image these levels, the physicists looked at electrons on the surface of a semiconductor material.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	Then they used scanning tunneling spectroscopy to look for the possible locations of electrons.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	This technique images a sample by allowing electrons to try to pass into it at different locations.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	If the location contains a feasible state for an electron, the particle will be able to jump into that state through a process called tunneling, confirming that it exists; if the location does not hold a potential electron state, there's nowhere for the electron to tunnel into.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	In the resulting image, light areas represent the locations of possible states, while black spots show the lack of electron states.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	The pictures produced byHashimoto and his team look remarkably like theoretical simulations predicted they would.	1	2	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	"I was very much hoping it would come out like that, and of course we were surprised the agreement was so good," Roemer told LiveScience.	3	3	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	"The agreement is even quantitatively so good."	3	3	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	Such images were never possible to make before because scanning tunneling spectroscopy has never been so advanced.	1	2	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	Each pixel in the team's pictures represents more than a half-hour of data taking, Roemer said.	2	2	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	"You really have to have a very good experimental setup, and you have to have lots of time," he said.	3	2	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	Redefining the kilogram	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	And Landau levels aren't just an esoteric curio.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	They could be put into practical use to help redefine the kilogram, the fundamental unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI).	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	While most SI units are defined by relations between fundamental constants that can be reproduced anywhere to derive the correct value, the kilogram is currently defined by a golf ball-size lump of metal kept in a vault in France.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	Scientists want to change that by defining the kilogram in terms of the weight it would take to counterbalance an electromagnetic force produced by a magnetic coil.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	The strength of this force is partly dependent on the von Klitzing constant, which is itself linked to Landau levels.	1	1	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	"Imaging Landau levels doesn't help set up the balance, but it strengthens the understanding of the underlying theory we have, that the von Klitzing constant is a universal constant, and it tells us it's really true," Roemer said.	2	3	1			
191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	"We can look at these states and really find them there."	2	2	1

192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	Only our totally unbiased watchdog media could turn the burning of U.S. embassies in countries where Barack Obama had recently supported mob revolts into Mitt Romney's blunder. Journalists couldn't risk having Obama's campaign slogan "Osama is dead" being amended with "and so is our ambassador."	2	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	After our ambassador to Libya was murdered in a preplanned, coordinated attack on our embassy last week, preceded by an attack on our embassy in Egypt (and followed by attacks on our embassies in Yemen, Indonesia, Tunisia and Lebanon), Romney criticized the Obama administration for "sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt."	1	1	3		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	He was referring to a statement put out by our Cairo embassy before the ambassador's murder, criticizing an American filmmaker whose YouTube trailer was the alleged provocation for the attacks. Attacks that happened to occur on the anniversary of 9/11.	2	1	3		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	The NFM (Non-Fox Media) uniformly denounced Romney's criticism and pronounced his campaign finished.	1	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	The Obama administration insisted that Romney had his "facts" wrong: Obama had absolutely nothing to do with the statement -- the embassy staff was freelancing -- and, even if the White House had approved it, it was a good statement because the riots were caused by the movie trailer, and furthermore, the embassy statement was issued before the riots even began.	1	2	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	This is known as an argument in the alternative: "I didn't break into that house, and if I did, I didn't steal the silver, and if I did, I only got twenty bucks for it."	3	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	If the statement were issued before our embassy in Cairo was attacked, then what was the administration responding to? Does the White House make it a practice to put out statements condemning random, barely viewed YouTube videos? The White House officially endorses that cute video of Kooky82's cat attempting to meow the national anthem.	3	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	The embassy's statement was obviously responding to something, and if anyone in the administration -- even that rogue embassy official! -- knew the Internet video was upsetting our dear Muslim friends, why on earth weren't our embassies protected?	4	1	3		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	Next, the Obama administration detained the American filmmaker and asked Google to block the allegedly offending video. (Take the week off, First Amendment.)	3	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	This behavior made it difficult for even the most obsequious journalist to keep railing against Romney for suggesting that Obama was acquiescing to angry Muslims. So the NFM's harangue against Romney was deposited in the same filing cabinet where the paperwork to close Gitmo is currently stored.	2	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	Now, a week later, Romney has said something, again. (Damn him!) This provoked another round of hysterical denunciations from the media.	3	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	At a private gathering, Romney told donors that Obama had a lock on the 47 percent of voters "who pay no income tax" and "believe the government has a responsibility to care for them." This was deeply offensive to people who pay no income tax and believe the government has a responsibility to care for them.	3	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	But no matter how much the media belch out the usual cliches -- out of touch, insensitive, racist, not one of us, Thurston Howell, etc. etc. -- all most people heard was: FORTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF AMERICANS PAY NO INCOME TAX?	4	2	3		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	A friend of mine who spent time in Russia during the '70s told me that whenever a Russian would bring up the extensive coverage of Watergate, he'd sigh, thinking he'd have to explain that the American political system was not as corrupt as the commissars would have it. But all they ever wanted to ask him was: "Do all Americans have such nice shoes?"	2	2	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	The lesson is: You can't always control what the audience notices.	1	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	Thanks to the myopia of our one-party media, most journalists are firmly convinced that voters will be appalled by Romney's description of 47 percent of Americans as supporting Obama because they pay no income tax. (Yes, head-up-their-butts journalists in the charming little burg of Manhattan are complaining that Romney isn't connecting with ordinary people.)	2	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	But the only people shocked by Romney's statement of fact are those who would never vote Republican under any circumstances. Everyone else is saying, "Is it really as high as 47 percent?" -- as the media impotently shouts, "No, you idiot! That's not the point!"	3	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	There's going to come a time, in the not-distant future, when it's 51 percent paying no income tax. And when that happens, the party of big government will never lose another election. America will become indistinguishable from Western European nanny states -- except there will be no America to protect us.	2	1	2		4	
192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	The media happen to love the party of big government with all their heart, so from now until the election, no matter what Romney says, they plan to be scandalized.	1	2	2		4

195	emergency-responders-stung-bee-truck-rollover-161557236	(AP) — Several emergency responders have been stung after a flatbed truck carrying honeybees rolled over in rural Nevada.	1	1	3		4	
195	emergency-responders-stung-bee-truck-rollover-161557236	Authorities say 66-year-old truck driver Rudy Breneman had been hauling a load of bees from Bruce, S.D., to California when he pulled to the side of the highway east of Tonopah — about 200 miles northwest of Las Vegas — on Monday afternoon.	1	1	3		4	
195	emergency-responders-stung-bee-truck-rollover-161557236	Breneman told troopers the big rig started sinking into the soft dirt of the shoulder and eventually tipped over, breaking open many of the hives.	1	1	3		4

196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	NASHVILLE, Tenn.	1	1	1	S	4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	(AP) — Emmylou Harris loves Mumford & Sons for a special reason.	1	3	1	S	4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	"They're making the banjo respectable, which is not an easy feat, and I'm so glad it's finally happening," Harris joked.	2	4	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	Harris, an iconic singer and member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, and Mumford & Sons, platinum-selling lads from London who have sparked a folk rock resurgence, are joining together to explore their shared love of high harmony, sad songs and, yes, the oft-belittled banjo on an episode of "CMT Crossroads" on Thursday night.	3	2	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	The Nashville-based Harris had only briefly met lead singer Marcus Mumford before agreeing to do the show based on the waves they created in the music world.	2	1	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	They coordinated song choices by phone and got together to rehearse for a little more than a day before recording the show earlier this month.	1	1	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	It was a crash course in catalog consumption and the chance to get to know each other.	2	2	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	"They're great harmony (singers) and they've got this great driving groove with a minimalist instrumentation," Harris said.	3	3	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	"But they just sound good and the songs have beautiful melodies and I love harmonizing on them."	3	3	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	She said it proves her theory that music is going to keep reinventing itself in good ways.	2	2	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	"You don't have to repeat the past.	2	1	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	We learn from the past, but we have to come forward with something different and there are just so many different combinations to make good music that touches people," she said.	2	2	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	Harris, 65, was among the gateway artists who helped Mumford and bandmates Ben Lovett, Ted Dwane and Winston Marshall discover their love for American roots music.	1	3	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	It started with the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack.	1	1	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	Harris appeared with Gillian Welch and Alison Krauss on the memorable song "Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby."	2	2	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	That eventually led them to the Old Crow Medicine Show and then deep immersion in old-timey sounds from America's long-neglected past.	3	1	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	They ran across Harris' imprint many times along the way, and with the help of dobro master Jerry Douglas, they help explore that legacy on the show.	2	1	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	"Pretty much every song that Emmylou has sung on is my favorite song of whichever artist she sang with," Mumford said.	3	3	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	"I'm like an obsessive Emmylou Harris freak and I'm not ashamed."	4	3	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	In turn, the quartet has helped shine a light on the influence Harris and the extensive roots underground still exerts.	2	3	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	The band, which releases their new album, "Babel," this week, were a growing success story in that community when they appeared on the 2011 Grammy Awards with Bob Dylan and the Avett Brothers, launching Mumford & Sons into the national popular consciousness.	2	3	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	Their album "Sigh No More" is now double platinum and "Babel" is one of the year's most anticipated albums.	2	3	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	"For us, it's kind of a bit of a dream come true," Dwane said.	3	4	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	"We'd never thought we'd get to travel so extensively, meet our heroes and collaborate with so many people.	3	4	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	... We're just having a really nice time."	3	4	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	Like the band, fans have discovered something new in those old sounds.	1	1	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	Mumford & Sons routinely drew 10,000 and more fans on their Gentleman of the Road tour across the U.S. this summer, almost all of them dancing along to Marshall's banjo.	2	3	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	"Folk music has always been there, but it's wonderful to see the infusion of freshness and energy, but still having that passion," Harris said.	2	3	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	"Not just mimicking what went before, but infusing it.	2	1	1		4	
196	emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721	I was joking about the banjo, but I'm serious."	3	1	1		4

202	eu-moves-step-closer-non-russia-gas-134041279--finance	BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe moved a step closer to loosening Russia's grip on European Union energy supplies after Italy, Albania and Greece signed an agreement supporting the construction of a pipeline to deliver gas from Azerbaijan.	1	1	1		4	
202	eu-moves-step-closer-non-russia-gas-134041279--finance	At a ceremony in New York on Thursday, the three countries signed a memorandum of understanding bringing the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) closer to reality, although building was not likely to commence until 2014 or 2015.	2	1	1		4	
202	eu-moves-step-closer-non-russia-gas-134041279--finance	The deal improves TAP's chances against Nabucco West, the other remaining contender in the race to become the first pipeline to deliver Azeri gas to Europe, diversifying the supply.	1	2	1		4	
202	eu-moves-step-closer-non-russia-gas-134041279--finance	Nabucco West would run from the Turkish border via a northerly gas hub in Austria while TAP would link to Europe via Italy.	1	1	1		4	
202	eu-moves-step-closer-non-russia-gas-134041279--finance	TAP's managing director Kjetil Tungland called the agreement "a testament to TAP's commercial and technical strengths" and the European commissioner for energy, Guenther Oettinger, said it represented a significant breakthrough.	2	2	1		4	
202	eu-moves-step-closer-non-russia-gas-134041279--finance	"This is another important step towards our aim to get gas directly from the Caspian region," Oettinger said on Friday.	3	2	1		4

202	eu-moves-step-closer-non-russia-gas-134041279--finance	Tension between the European Union and Russia over energy has flared repeatedly and worsened since the Commission, the EU's executive, announced this month that it was investigating suspected anti-competitive practices by Gazprom , Russia state-controlled gas monopoly.	2	1	2		4

205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	Brussels proposed earlier this month that the European Central Bank (ECB) take charge of supervising all banks in the euro currency zone, as a first step towards creating a banking union under which euro zone countries would eventually jointly back their lenders.	1	2	1		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	However, the plan has sparked concerns among the 10 EU countries which do not use the euro that they will be indirectly affected by the ECB's new supervisory powers and put at a competitive disadvantage, whether they join the scheme or not.	1	1	3		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	Legally, the European Parliament will have no say in writing much of the legislation for a banking union.	1	1	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	But it has powers to amend other important financial regulations and can exert influence to change or even delay the new regime.	1	2	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	"What's the point of having a single supervisory mechanism (for the euro zone) when you have the UK with its 60 percent of the financial market not involved?" said Werner Langen, a German lawmaker, in the debate on Wednesday.	3	1	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	"Instead of a single supervisory mechanism, we have a division of Europe, a very explosive division."	3	1	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	Langen's views were echoed throughout the debate of the parliament's influential economic and monetary affairs committee, where members from around Europe voiced conflicting views about the shape of a banking union.	1	2	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	"What we don't want to do here is split the EU down the middle," said Wolf Klinz, a German member of parliament.	2	1	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	"What we don't want to see is that the British push themselves into a corner where they have a referendum and they say ... that's enough for us."	2	1	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	BETTER CONTROL				I	4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	A banking union, which would aim to restore confidence in an industry that has been battered by crisis for nearly five years, has three major steps: the ECB takes over monitoring euro zone banks and others that sign up; a single fund is created to close down and settle the debts of failed banks; and a comprehensive scheme to protect savers' deposits is established.	1	1	1		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	As well as building the foundation for better control of banks, the union would be important because it should allow the euro zone's rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), to directly inject much-needed capital into banks, such as those in Spain.	1	3	1		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	"We are under time pressure," said Sven Giegold, a German member of the parliament, who also flagged concerns about a two-tier scheme damaging those countries on the outside.	2	1	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	"The banking union ... is linked to access to the ESM."	1	1	1		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	This pledge, made by euro zone leaders in June, appears to be unraveling, however, after Germany, the Netherlands and Finland drew a distinction between future banking problems and "legacy" difficulties - which could mean that problem banks in Spain and Ireland remain the states' responsibility.	1	1	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	"This proposal is to allow for the direct recapitalization of Spanish banks because Spain doesn't want to put in a normal application (for aid)," said Langen, who is a member of the CDU, the same political party as German Chancellor Angela Merkel.	1	1	1		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	"The whole European system of banking supervision is being turned on its head for the sake of Spain.	3	1	3		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	As this thing has been turned on its head, we need to turn it back again," Langen said.	3	2	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	SUPERVISORY REACH				I	4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	The debate underscored a central problem of the union - that it could drive a wedge between those countries inside the scheme and those outside, whose banks may suffer as a result.	2	1	3		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg has said he would not accept ECB oversight of Nordea , the Nordic region's biggest bank, as long as his country remains outside a banking union.	1	1	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	Nordea has its headquarters outside the euro zone in Stockholm, but has major operations in Finland, the sole Nordic country to use the common currency.	1	1	1		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	While Britain will stay outside the scheme, many international banks in London - ranging from HSBC to Citi - have operations in the euro zone that will be affected by the ECB's new supervisory reach.	1	1	1		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	London is worried that the ECB, emboldened by its new powers, will demand regulation that could undermine the city's position as Europe's financial capital.	1	1	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	Some believe that the European Banking Authority (EBA), set up to coordinate the supervision of banks in response to the financial crisis and which is run by regulators from across the European Union, could act as a counterbalance.	1	1	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	The European Commission has already suggested a special voting mechanism among EU regulators as a counterweight to the power of those in the euro zone.	1	2	1		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	"Countries should be lured in, tempted in - it should be made difficult for a country to refuse," said Giegold, who will play a leading role in talks about the plan.	4	2	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	"The system should be so attractive that everyone will want to join," Giegold said, in an appeal which is likely to be ignored in London.	4	2	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	The close ties between some troubled governments and the banks they supervise - and on which they also rely to buy their debt - have dragged both ever-deeper into crisis.	1	1	2		4	
205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	A banking union would break this link by making the policing of banks supranational and establishing central schemes paid into collectively to cover the costs of closing failed lenders and protecting savers' deposits.	1	1	2		4

206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - They wore the colors loved by the late Seve Ballesteros and a silhouette of him on their sleeves, and then Team Europe rode his spirit on Sunday to the greatest Ryder Cup comeback victory ever.	2	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	"We wanted to do it for Seve," said Englishman Luke Donald, who started Europe on their way to erasing a massive four-point deficit with a 2&1 victory over American Bubba Watson.	3	3	2		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	Spaniard Sergio Garcia turned around his match against Jim Furyk by winning the last two holes for a one-up victory.	2	2	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	"I have no doubt in my mind that he was with me today all day," Garcia said about compatriot Ballesteros, who breathed fire into the Ryder Cup after the Britain-Ireland team was expanded to include players from all of Europe.	3	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	"Because there's no chance I would have won my match if he wasn't there."	3	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	Ballesteros died last year at age 54 after a battle with cancer.	1	1	3		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	Europe captain Jose Maria Olazabal had long ago been taken under the wing of Ballesteros, who ignited a proud surge in European golf with his three British Open crowns and two Masters triumphs.	3	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	Olazabal, who formed the most successful Ryder Cup tandem alongside Ballesteros, told the team in their meeting on Saturday night that he felt Seve in the room and that he could help propel the Europeans to a victory despite trailing 10-6.	2	2	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	"Seve will always be present with this team.	3	2	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	He was a big factor for this event, for the European side and last night when we were having that meeting I think the boys understood that believing was the most important thing," said Olazabal.	3	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	Wearing blue and white, the favorite colors of the fiery Spanish competitor, Europe took apart the host team to match the biggest final-day points comeback ever in the Ryder Cup.	3	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	The U.S. team had overcome the same margin to beat Europe in 1999 at Brookline, with Olazabal left gloomy on the 17th green in the clinching match.	2	2	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	But that record Ryder comeback took place before a roaring U.S. home crowd and this amazing Europe fight back came on foreign soil.	2	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	The first five European players won their singles matches and the competition came down to the final two matches when 2010 PGA Championship winner Martin Kaymer sank a five-footer at the 18th to clinch it.	2	2	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	"We wanted to show our grit.	3	2	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	We've been known for not being that great in singles, and we showed that we can win," said Donald.	3	2	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	"It's going down in history.	3	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	We talk about Brookline in '99, losing that one.	3	2	2		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	We wanted to come back and show that we could win from behind, too."	3	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	Englishman Ian Poulter, added to the team as a wild-card pick by Olazabal, beat U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson two up to complete an impeccable Cup with wins in all four of his matches.	2	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	"My captain picked me to come and play, and you know, I owe it to him, and Seve, to be here today," he said.	3	2	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	Olazabal, who had tears in his eyes after the victory, said he got emotional thinking about Ballesteros.	3	4	2		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	"He's already smiling about it and laughing about it," the captain said.	3	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	"This has been a very special week.	3	3	1		5	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	Seve, it's the first time that he's not here with us at the Ryder Cup.	3	2	1		5

207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	Healthy lungs are home to bacterial communities, just as healthy intestines and skin are.	1	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	That was one finding of new research that also showed that while patients with cystic fibrosis may be hampered by the bacterial communities that live in their lungs, it is the composition of these colonies, rather than their mere presence, that causes problems.	1	1	2		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	"For many years, people have considered the lung to be a relatively sterile organ," said study researcher Dr. David Cornfield, a professor of pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine.	1	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	"This provides some of the first and most definitive data that there is a forest of flora that exist in the lung, that are present even in the healthy lung."	2	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	The finding also suggests that probiotics could help in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that results from receiving copies of a recessive gene from both parents.	1	2	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	The disorder results in thicker, stickier mucus in the lungs and other organs, which allows certain bacteria to overgrow.	1	1	2		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	This can lead to infections and blockages, and eventually breathing difficulties, nutritional deficiencies, endocrine disorders such as diabetes, and infertility in men, among other problems.	1	1	2		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	Patients tend not to live past age 40.	1	1	3		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	In the new study, researchers examined the sputum from 16 cystic fibrosis patients and nine healthy control patients, and surveyed the organisms present using gene sequencing.	1	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	By examining the genes, rather than growing the bacteria in lab dishes, the researchers were able to get a better handle on the diversity of bacteria present.	1	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	While each person studied had a unique bacterial community in their lungs, the cystic fibrosis patients had communities that were more similar to each other than to those of the healthy people.	1	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	The patients' communities were also less diverse.	1	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	"This suggests there's probably some benefit to having bacteria in the lungs, to some balanced degree," Cornfield said.	2	2	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	"The traditional paradigm, that all bacteria in the lungs are bad, is probably not correct."	2	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	Instead, he said the findings support the idea of thinking of the bacteria in the lungs as a "rain forest."	3	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	"We know that in a rain forest, if species are lost, there develops an imbalance, and the ecosystem becomes much more fragile," Cornfield said.	1	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	While the lungs have been thought of as sterile, this is not the first study to find bacteria in healthy lungs, although the idea of communities is still somewhat controversial.	2	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	"Anything that comes into contact with the world is not going to be sterile," said Katrine Whiteson, a postdoctoral fellow at San Diego State University who studies microbe communities in the human body.	2	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	Whiteson said one issue not addressed by this study, but that is being tackled elsewhere, is the question of whether bacteria remain in the lungs over the long term, or whether they are "tourists" — with some strains leaving a person's lungs and new ones entering.	2	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	The new research, Cornfield said, could lead to better treatments for cystic fibrosis patients.	1	2	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	He said long-term antibiotics, a treatment given to many patients today, might become more effective if combined with probiotics to enhance bacterial diversity in patients lungs, although much more research is necessary to see if that is the case.	1	2	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	"That would be a paradigm shift of virtually epic proportions in the cystic fibrosis and even the lung biology community," Cornfield said.	2	1	1		4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	The study appears online today (Sept.				S	4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	26) in the journal Science Translational Medicine.				S	4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	Pass it on: Healthy lungs are home to colonies of bacteria, the discovery of which may lead to better treatments for cystic fibrosis sufferers.				I  	4

208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	It’s a professional referee’s job to ensure that games run smoothly, so it's perhaps no surprise that the absence of refs from this season's NFL games — thanks to contract disputes between the league and the referees' union — has led to almost unprecedented chaos.				i	4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	After three weeks of controversial calls, which culminated in a game-changing decision in a matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers on Monday, news outlets have reported that the referees and the NFL are close to signing a deal.	2	1	1		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	As the lockout approaches its end, it's worth looking back at how it began.	2	1	1		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	What is the dispute about?	1	1	1		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	Who should be blamed?	1	1	1		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	And what does it mean for the future of the football season?	1	1	1		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	Here, everything you need to know about the NFL's referee lockout:	3	1	1		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	What are the NFL and the referees fighting about?There are several areas of disagreement, but the biggest sticking point is money.	1	1	2		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	The referees want to stick with a pension plan that was originally negotiated in 2006; the NFL wants to implement a 401(k) plan instead.	1	1	1		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	The NFL's refusal to budge has puzzled many analysts because the cost differential between the pension and the 401(k) is relatively small: Roughly .33 percent of the league's annual $10 billion revenue, or $100,000 per team per season — a figure some commentators have called the equivalent of a "rounding error" for the NFL.				i	4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	Who did the NFL hire to replace the locked-out referees?A group of less-experienced officials culled from smaller markets like the Arena Football League, Divisions II and III of the NCAA, and — in one particularly damning case — the Lingerie Football League (LFL), a far-from-professional league in which women play the game in bras and panties.				i	4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	Fans and commentators have expressed both frustration with this solution and sympathy for the stand-in refs' inexperience.	1	1	2		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	What do the NFL players think?The vast majority have sided with the referees.	2	1	1		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	Many players have spoken of their exasperation in post-game interviews, or taken to Twitter, voicing complaints like "I thought I was watching Punk'd" and calling the use of replacements "a slap in the face."	2	1	2		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	What do sportswriters think?They're furious.	2	1	2		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	"The NFL used to be the Mona Lisa," says Rick Reilly at ESPN.com, rather grandly, and the referee's strike "is painting a mustache on it."	4	1	1		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	"This may not be the worst mistake a commissioner has made in my lifetime, but it is surely the dumbest," adds Michael Rosenberg at Sports Illustrated.	4	1	2		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	The general consensus: The NFL has seriously damaged its integrity, and put its players at risk, to save money that it would barely even notice was gone.	3	1	2		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	Has the lockout hurt the NFL?In reputation, yes; in revenue, no.	3	1	2		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	Despite widespread criticism from fans and players, neither viewership nor attendance has declined.	2	2	2		4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	In fact, the debate over the Seahawks-Packers game has drawn much attention to the NFL, leading many analysts to conclude that NFL ratings will be up next weekend — if only due to perverse curiosity — which may be why the league hasn't seemed to be in a hurry to cut a deal.				i	4	
208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	Will the lockout really end soon?Reports are mixed.	1	1	1		4

211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - As a former wrestler, Mulayam Singh Yadav has got India's government where he likes it - in a vice-like grip.	2	2	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	The ructions over fresh economic reforms that reduced the ruling coalition to a parliamentary minority last month left Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dependent on this wheeler-dealer from the country's dusty northern plains.	2	2	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	In an interview with Reuters, Yadav insisted there were no strings attached to his support for Singh's Congress party, just a desire to keep the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power.	3	2	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	"We are supporting them," he said in the Hindi language, looking hearty for his 72 years despite rumors earlier this year that his health was failing.	3	2	2		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	"There are no conditions of any kind, it's only to ensure communal forces do not get strengthened."	3	2	2		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	However, Yadav is at least as well known for his maneuvering as he was in his youth for pinning opponents down in a wrestling bout: Congress party leaders know he cannot be trusted to stick with them through thick and thin - and few are convinced when he denies any ambition to one day become prime minister.	3	2	2		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	For now, the 22 lawmakers of Yadav's Samajwadi (Socialist) Party will side with the government, ensuring it can muster the 272 votes needed in parliament to prevent its collapse.	2	2	2		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Their support became crucial after another regional party leader left the coalition, angry over hikes in the price of subsidized fuel and a decision to open India's doors to foreign supermarket giants.	3	2	3		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Yadav's take on the reforms is that he opposes them, but will nevertheless continue to support the government.	2	2	2		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	"We will oppose anything that goes against the interests of the people," he said.	3	3	1		4

211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Yadav was born to a rural family in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state with 200 million people and - since it sends more lawmakers to Delhi than any other - its politically most important.	2	2	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	As a young man, he trained as a wrestler before being attracted to socialism and local politics, eventually becoming chief minister of the state three times and federal defense minister in a coalition government during the 1990s.	1	1	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Six months ago, when his Samajwadi Party returned to power in Uttar Pradesh after a hiatus, Yadav stood aside for his son Akhilesh to head the state government.	1	1	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	That, and what was perhaps a bout of ill-health, set off reports he was seriously ill and no longer well enough to hold office.	2	1	2		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	"I am fine," Yadav said at his sprawling colonial bungalow in Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh.	2	2	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Impeccably dressed in the starched white dhoti-kurta of the region and his salt-and-pepper hair still damp from a mid-morning bath, he showed few signs of age as he strode out from under the porch of his home, chatting with aides and party colleagues.	3	3	1		4

211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	In India, where caste and family play hugely important roles in politics, the Yadavs have several advantages.	2	2	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	They are from a land-owning lower caste whose members were mostly subsistence farmers and cattle herders, but have become wealthier, more politically aware and socially assertive in recent decades.	2	2	2		4

211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	On the negative side, the party is anathema for other lower caste groups.	2	1	2		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Critics also say it is tarred by association with people who have criminal pasts, and previous Samajwadi Party rule in Uttar Pradesh brought rampant corruption and increased violence.	2	1	3		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	The other family firmly entrenched in Indian politics is the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has ruled the country for a majority of the years since independence in 1947, and also looks on Uttar Pradesh as its base.	2	2	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Akhilesh is often compared to the scion of that dynasty, Rahul Gandhi, whose Congress party was burned by the Samajwadi win in the Uttar Pradesh elections earlier this year.	2	2	2		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	He dismisses talk of rivalry or probable cooperation.	2	2	2		4

211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Although the Congress party-led coalition could coax other parties to keep it alive, for now it is dependent on Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is widely expected to demand a pound of flesh despite his professed unconditional support.	2	2	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	News reports have said he will press for an illegal wealth case against him to be dropped, and for impoverished Uttar Pradesh to get more federal aid.	3	2	2		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Longer term, Yadav could be preparing to form a "Third Front" government, an amalgam of smaller parties that keeps out both Congress and BJP after national elections due by mid-2014.	3	1	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Analysts and voter surveys suggest no clear winner will emerge in those polls, meaning the Third Front may well have the parliamentary numbers to stake a claim to power.	2	2	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Since Yadav's party won Uttar Pradesh with a large majority, odds are he will have enough lawmakers in parliament after the 2014 elections to put him in pole position to form a coalition, and to head it.	2	2	1		4	
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	Asked if Yadav could become prime minister, Sudha Pai, a political scientist who is rector at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said: "He knows how to make a deal, how to get on with other political parties.	3	3	1		4

211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	But the murmurs in his party, where he is called Netaji, or leader, are growing.	2	1	1		4

212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	Exclusive: Facebook to charge merchants to run Offers	1	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said it will start charging businesses to run Offers on its social network, turning a previously free service into a potential revenue generator at a time when Wall Street is demanding new sources of growth and profit from the company.				i	4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	Facebook launched Facebook Offers earlier this year, letting retailers and other local merchants send deals to their Facebook fans.	1	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	Users claim the offers from their News Feeds and redeem the vouchers at stores to get discounts.	1	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	The service has been free, but in coming weeks Facebook will require merchants to pay at least $5 on related ads to promote each Facebook Offer to a targeted audience of fans and friends of fans.	1	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	The cost will vary based on the size of a company's Facebook pages.	1	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	Since Facebook went public in May, the company has been under pressure from Wall Street to show how it can turn its giant social network into a money machine.	2	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	Facebook shares have lost about 40 percent of their value since the IPO.	1	1	2		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	The commerce potential of Facebook, known as f-commerce, has yet to materialize, partly because retailers have been able to feast on a host of free tools on the social network to attract customers.	2	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	Tying Facebook Offers to a paid ad service suggests the company is working to change this.	2	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	"We think this aligns incentives nicely," said Gokul Rajaram, director of product management for Facebook's advertising and Pages businesses.	3	2	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	"The best results on Facebook Offers will come from organic distribution plus paid distribution."	2	2	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	In the past, some Facebook Offers have not been relevant to all users, partly because some people saw deals in their News Feeds from merchants located far away from where they live, Rajaram added.	1	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	"The requirement to pay for related ads will focus merchants on who and where they want the offer to reach," he said.	3	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	Facebook is also expanding Offers to online-only businesses, he added.	1	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	Before, the service was available only to merchants with physical locations.	1	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	Facebook is also adding barcodes for offers, so customers can redeem offers more easily.	2	1	1		4	
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	The barcodes work globally, Rajaram noted.	1	1	1		4

214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Exclusive: Spain ready for bailout, Germany signals "wait"- sources	1	1	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Madrid (Reuters) - Spain is ready to request a euro zone bailout for its public finances as early as next weekend but Germany has signaled that it should hold off, European officials said on Monday.	2	2	3		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	The latest twist in the euro zone's three-year-old sovereign debt crisis comes as financial markets and some other European partners are pressuring Madrid to seek a rescue program that would trigger European Central Bank buying of its bonds.	3	1	4		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	"The Spanish were a bit hesitant but now they are ready to request aid," a senior European source said.	3	2	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Three other euro zone senior euro zone sources confirmed the shift in the Spanish position, all speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.	2	1	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said Spain is taking all the right steps to overcome its fiscal problems and does not need a bailout, arguing that investors will recognize and reward Spanish reforms in due course.	3	2	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Privately, several European diplomats and a senior German source said Chancellor Angela Merkel preferred to avoid putting more individual bailouts for distressed euro zone countries to her increasingly reluctant parliament.	3	1	3		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	"It doesn't make sense to send looming decisions on Greece, Cyprus and possibly also Spain to the Bundestag one by one," the senior German source said.	3	1	3		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	"Bundling these together makes sense, due to the substance and also politically."	3	2	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Participants said there were tense exchanges at a euro zone ministerial meeting in Cyprus in mid-September when Schaeuble told his peers Berlin could not take another bailout for Spain to parliament so soon after lawmakers approved up to 100 billion euros ($129 billion) to help Spanish banks in July.	3	2	4		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Asked about the reports that Germany was urging Spain to wait, a German government spokesman told Reuters: "Every country decides for itself.	3	2	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Germany isn't pushing in one direction or the other."	2	2	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	A spokeswoman for Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said she was not aware of any veto from Germany for an aid request.	3	2	3		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	"What we are focused on is to get the decisions of the June summit on the banking union implemented.	3	2	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	That would send a strong message of confidence to the markets," she said, referring to an EU decision to centralize oversight of the biggest banks to avoid a repeat of a crisis that has some of its roots in the banking system.	3	4	1		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	STALLING?	2	1	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	European sources said EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn was to deliver a message to Spanish leaders on Monday that Brussels wants them to apply for assistance soon and will not impose onerous conditions beyond the reforms and savings measures outlined by the Spanish government.	3	2	3		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Brussels is keen to avoid another paroxysm of the debt crisis by getting support to Spain before it is on the brink of being forced out of the bond market, at the risk of contagion spreading to Italy and other euro zone states.	2	2	4		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Rehn met Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Economy Minister Luis de Guindos in Madrid and said afterwards the conditions of any aid program were well known to all euro zone governments.	2	2	1		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	"Conditions would be based on country-specific recommendations that were decided for all 27 EU member states in July and there would be a clear set of policy priorities and clear timelines on the basis of these country-specific recommendations," he told a news conference.	3	2	1		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Euro zone officials are considering a so-called Enhanced Conditions Credit Line that would keep Spain in the credit markets with support from the euro zone rescue funds in the primary bond market and from the ECB in the secondary market.	2	2	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Rajoy is eager to avoid the political humiliation of conditions being imposed from outside and enforced by the "troika" of inspectors from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank that has supervised programs for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.	3	1	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	There has been widespread speculation that Rajoy was stalling a bailout bid until after October 21 regional elections in his home state of Galicia and the Basque Country.	4	1	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	But diplomats said it was German discouragement, not Spanish pride, that was now holding back a request for assistance.	3	1	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	One senior European diplomat said the Spanish position was: "We are in favor if everyone else accepts."	3	2	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Madrid did not want to risk submitting an application and having Berlin rebuff it by raising unacceptable conditions such as deep pension cuts or procedural obstacles, he said.	3	1	3		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	The senior euro zone source said Spanish leaders had understood that making a move now was the best way of avoiding losing market access and being forced into a full state bailout.	2	2	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	"The German U-turns have convinced the Spanish they could end up in the not too distant future in the same position as Greece, Portugal or Ireland - shut out of the markets and with a very harsh adjustment program," the source said.	3	1	4		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	The Spanish government said it would enact 43 structural reforms over the next six months and Brussels said the detailed timetable goes beyond what the Commission has asked of Spain and is an ambitious step forward.	2	3	1		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Rehn said he was fully confident Spain would take the necessary steps to restore the economy to health and added it must continue reforming its pension system, linking retirement age to life expectancy.	3	3	2		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Rajoy has said pensions are the last thing he would cut as he introduces sweeping savings through the social security system, though he has said he would introduce a new law on pensions before the end of the year.	2	2	3		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Spain needs to refinance some 29 billion euros in maturing debt -- including 9 billion in short-term paper -- by the end of this month.	1	1	3		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	The senior euro zone source said that under one scenario under consideration, Spain was ready to submit the request at the weekend, with German agreement, so euro zone finance ministers could discuss it at their next regular meeting in Luxembourg next Monday.	2	2	1		4	
214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Failing that, Madrid could make the application before an EU summit in Brussels on October 18-19, but euro zone partners such as France and Italy, which are pushing for an early decision, would not want it to drag on beyond then, the source said.	3	2	2		4

219	facebook-goes-groupon-pay-offers-scheme-000507579	Facebook Offers, which launched earlier this year, has so far been a free service that lets businesses send out special deals and coupons to their followers on Facebook.	1	2	1		4	
219	facebook-goes-groupon-pay-offers-scheme-000507579	But Reuters says that within the next month Facebook “will require merchants to pay at least $5 on related ads to promote each Facebook Offer to a targeted audience of fans and friends of fans.”	2	2	1		4	
219	facebook-goes-groupon-pay-offers-scheme-000507579	Facebook will also open up its Offers to online-only businesses, meaning that companies will no longer need to have a physical location to participate in the service.	2	2	1		4

224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	The government of India-administered Kashmir has blocked Facebook and YouTube, highlighting concerns about a clampdown on freedom of speech in the disputed region.	1	1	2		4	
224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	The move follows a gradual increase in online surveillance throughout the past few years in Kashmir, as youths have turned to social media as a form of political expression. After people in the Kashmir Valley protested the recent anti-Islam video that unleashed similar protests across the Muslim world, observers say it gave the government the excuse it was looking for and YouTube and Facebook went dead.	2	1	2		4	
224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	“This is one more step in pursuit of depriving the people of avenues of expression. The telecast of blasphemous film on YouTube simply served as a pretext to execute a predetermined policy by the government,” says Sheikh Showkat Hussain, a political analyst and academic who teaches human rights at Kashmir University.	2	1	2		4

224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	For six decades, a piece of land about the size of Britain situated between Pakistan and India has been the source of major tension and fighting between the two countries. Many within the mostly-Muslim Kashmir Valley want to be free of India. Nearly 70,000 people died following the outbreak of an armed Kashmiri insurgency in 1989, now quelled.	1	1	3		4	
224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	Kashmir’s state government has clamped down on freedom of speech in the past. During mass street protests in 2008, the government banned SMS text messaging. And since another protest wave in 2010, a number of college students have been arrested and taken to Cyber Cell Police Station, located in the summer capital of Srinagar, for posting or uploading anti-India text or pictures on Facebook or YouTube.	2	1	2		4	
224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	“Such a move by the government is a serious infringement on the freedom of speech,” says Sameer Yasir, assistant professor at the Centre for International Relations at the Islamic University of Science and Technology. The state has long wanted to block these specific sites, he says, but worried about popular outcry. This unprecedented step, he says, ultimately causes free speech to suffer. “This is unethical because social networking sites provide information to people. [A] gag on these sites is a suffering,” he says.	3	1	2		4	
224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	Dr. Hussain agrees: “Avenues of communication remain strangulated in Kashmir,” he says. “Internet was allowed after a lot of persuasion and resentment,” he adds. “However, with the passage of time other avenues of expression and communication were choked. The local news channels [have been] unable to telecast news and commentary since 2010 mass protests. SMS is banned on prepaid mobile networks.”	3	1	2		4	
224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	The Internet has been widely used by people in Kashmir, especially as a tool during times of military clampdown. Groups resisting Indian rule use Facebook to disseminate their message through Facebook pages such as "Freedom of Dawn," "Hoshar Jamaat" (Awakened Group), and "Kale Kharaab" (Hot Headed).	1	1	1		4	
224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	The popular separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani has been using YouTube as a way to get around the fact that the state government doesn’t allow him to address any public rally or go to Friday prayers.	1	1	2		4	
224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	One popular Facebook group, Aalaw (A call), found a way to still post a protest. The group recently posted on its feed: “Facebook partially banned in valley, sms banned, people caged this is what you called indian demon-crazy. Down with indian state and its policies. Aalaw will continue to reach you no matter facebook gets blocked in valley. Aalaw Radio Is on Cards.(sic)”	3	1	2		4	
224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	The private Internet service providers said their customer care executives reported that Facebook and YouTube would be restored after the ban is lifted by the government, but they are not sure when that will happen.	1	1	2		4

228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - The face of a young man looks out from billboards across Benghazi. "A mother's cry. If my son is guilty, bring him to justice. If he is innocent, let him go," says the caption, which ends with a phone number.	1	2	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	Speaking at the family home, the mother, Ansaf Ibrahim, recounts how dozens of militia fighters from the February 17 Brigade stormed in on August 30 and seized her husband Ali Muftag al-Warfalli and their son Firas, 21, a dentistry student.	2	1	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	The brigade, named for the start date of the revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, is one of the largest and most heavily armed militias prowling Libya a year after the civil war ended. Most operate with the permission of the weak central government. They answer to their own leaders and maintain their own jails.	3	1	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	Such arrests, described by many Libyans as kidnappings, are fuelling a backlash, which has intensified in the days since the killing of U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in an attack on the U.S. consulate.	2	1	4			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	Ansaf Ibrahim says a few people have called in response to the billboards but so far they have not been able to help, offering only sympathy. "One person called to say his own mother fell sick with grief when she saw the billboards."	2	1	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	The militia say their powers to arrest and detain people are vital to protect a country where the police and security forces are too weak to maintain order.	3	2	2			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	February 17 says it has turned the two al-Warfalli prisoners over to the military police. A member of the brigade's High Security Committee said Ali Muftag, the father, was held on suspicion of having ties to Gaddafi loyalists in Egypt and Firas on suspicion of links to militants who set off bombs in Tripoli.	2	1	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	Ansaf Ibrahim says both men are innocent.	3	3	1			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	She believes her son was taken in just because he was at home when the militia arrived to arrest her husband, who was a student in Britain in the 1980s when pro-Gaddafi students inside the Libyan embassy were blamed for shooting a policewoman.	3	1	4			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	"Whatever they think the father has done, that doesn't mean my son has done something too. If you want the father, you do not have to take the son in this horrible, frightening and savage way," she said.	2	1	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	PULLED OFF STREET AFTER SPEAKING OUT				I		
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	Activists who speak out against the detentions say they frequently become targets too.	1	1	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	Journalist Sherifa al-Senoussi al-Fsay, who has criticized militia abductions in television broadcasts, was pulled off the street in May after leaving the home of a detainee's family. A car pulled up and armed men jumped out.	1	2	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	"They took my bag and searched it. They saw my journalist ID. I was yelling, saying I was a journalist," she recalled.	1	1	2			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	"I was trying to make them stop. One of them grabbed my veil. They tried to haul me away. I wriggled free and ran to a building. I tried to ask for help but one of the men grabbed me and dragged me across the ground. They took me to the car, threw me inside and beat me."	2	1	4			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	She says she was driven to a deserted spot and bundled into another car with another group of armed men, who also hit her.	2	1	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	Finally, she was delivered to a police station in central Benghazi. Activists demonstrated outside to demand her release and, after two days, a sympathetic militia leader sent armed men into the police station to free her.	1	3	1			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	Four months later, al-Fsay still does not dare say which of the hundreds of armed groups she blames for having captured her, fearful they will retaliate.	2	1	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	The government says it is taking steps to rein in the militia. Those that operate without government permission are being dissolved, while those that have government permission are being incorporated into the regular army's chain of command.	1	2	1			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	The government said on Monday it was replacing the civilian leaders of February 17 and another powerful Benghazi militia that also operates its own jail, Rafalla al-Sahati. The leaders of the two militias, among the most powerful men in the country, are to be replaced with uniformed army colonels, putting their forces fully under the army chain of command.	2	2	1			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	The billboard pictures of Firas al-Warfalli stared down as thousands of Libyans demonstrated over the weekend against militias on a march known as "Rescue Benghazi Day".	2	1	2			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	The protesters seized bases of the Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia, which did not have government permission and which Washington suspects of having had some kind of connection to the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens.	1	1	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	The demonstrators then marched on the heavily fortified compound of Rafallah al-Sahati, one of the biggest militias that operate with government approval. The protesters looted the compound and freed prisoners. The authorities backed the militia the following morning and its base is again occupied.	1	2	3			
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	At the al-Warfalli house, Firas's 10-year-old brother comes into the room where his mother is meeting journalists, poses for a snapshot and scampers out. "My little son has a new game he plays," his mother says, imitating a small boy pretending to fire a machine gun. "He says: ‘I'm going to kill February 17 and get my father back for us.'"	3	2	3

229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	WASHINGTON (AP) — Farm-state members of Congress have campaigned for decades on the back of farm bills delivering election-season subsidies and other goodies to rural voters.	2	2	1		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Not this year. The bill is stalled, primarily because House GOP leaders don't want a noisy fight over food stamps this close to the election. That poses a particular problem for some Republicans in tight races for the Senate or the House who will go home empty-handed when Congress adjourns this week.	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Democrats are gloating.	2	2	1		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	"It's something that should have been easy," says Heidi Heitkamp, the Democrat running against Republican Rep. Rick Berg in a neck-and-neck, open Senate race in North Dakota. "Something that should have been done did not get done."	3	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Heitkamp and other Democratic challengers are using the farm bill as an example of how they say the Republican-run House is ineffective. Current farm law, which extends subsidy payments to farmers and pays for food stamps, is scheduled to expire Sept. 30, with no new law in place for the first time in recent memory.	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	In addition to the effect on the North Dakota race, the failure to get a farm bill is affecting the Senate race in Montana and House races in Iowa, South Dakota, Colorado and Illinois.	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Farm policy has traditionally been one of the more bipartisan issues on Capitol Hill. It still is, to an extent — the Senate in June passed the five-year farm bill with almost two-thirds of the chamber supporting it. A separate version passed the House Agriculture Committee in July with Republican and Democratic support.	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Calling it a farm bill is something of a misnomer. Food stamps make up roughly 80 percent of the costs in both versions. The House would cut them 2 percent, angering many Democrats who don't want them cut at all and Republicans who say they should be cut more. The Senate version would cut them by one-half of 1 percent.	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Since 2008, the food stamp program has more than doubled in cost, to $80 billion a year, driven by high, sustained unemployment, rising food prices and expanded eligibility under President Barack Obama's 2009 economic stimulus law. Food stamps now help feed roughly 46 million Americans, or 1 in 7.	1	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	It is unclear how angry rural voters will be about the lack of a farm bill. The farm economy has been strong in recent years, and expiration won't mean an immediate loss of benefits for most farmers. But farm-state members argue that the certainty of federal policy is necessary for farmers making their annual business plans this fall and approaching bankers for loans.	2	2	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Punting the bill may also mean less money overall. While both chambers' versions of the bill would save tens of billions of dollars from current spending, the agriculture committees may be asked to save even more as budgets tighten further next year.	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	"They are concerned there will be fewer resources if we do it next year, so they worry it will hurt their crop insurance," Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said of farmers in his state, where he and Rep. Tom Latham both face serious challenges from Democrats.	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	King and Berg — along with Republican House colleagues Denny Rehberg of Montana, Kristi Noem of South Dakota and others — have made repeated appeals to Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and other GOP leaders to bring the Agriculture Committee's bill to the floor before Congress adjourns this week.	1	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	"The farm bill is far too important for too many Montanans to let election-year politics get in the way of doing the right thing," said Rehberg, who is in a competitive Senate race.	2	2	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Noem, who is defending her House seat against Democrat Matt Varilek, said party leaders are hesitant to bring up a vote on a bill that they think might fail.	1	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	"I am sure they are getting tired of seeing me come down the hallway to talk to them about that," she said. "It's been a disappointment to me that they've made the decisions that they have made."	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., said the legislation has turned into "a food stamp bill" that has bogged down because of both the presidential and congressional campaigns.	1	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	"There's not 218 votes to pass it," Huelskamp told reporters. "It's going to be very tough to do that, even in a lame-duck session."	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Some House Democrats also are scrambling for cover. Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, who faces a challenge from 2010 opponent Ben Lange, last week introduced a discharge petition to place the bill on the floor calendar over House leaders' objections.	1	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Though Berg, Noem, Rehberg and a handful of other Republicans signed it, a majority of the House is needed — unlikely when Republicans hold 240 seats to Democrats' 190 and after conservative groups came out against the bill as too expensive.	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	"I am frustrated that it's not progressing," Berg said of the bill. "The unfortunate thing is that I am seeing it become political, which it really hasn't been for the last year and a half."	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Heitkamp is up with radio ads in North Dakota criticizing Berg for "toeing the party line" on farm programs and endorsing some agriculture cuts. In the ad, targeted at farmers who listen to the radio while out in the fields, she reminds voters that agriculture is a $6 billion industry in the state.	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who is facing the challenge from Rehberg and is himself a farmer, calls the House's failure to take up the farm bill "total craziness."	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	"It's going to have some pretty negative effects on agriculture if these people don't get off their butts and get it passed," he said in an interview. "I am going to continue to try and talk some common sense into the House of Representatives."	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	Also getting criticism on the campaign trail for the farm bill's collapse are Republican Reps. Scott Tipton in Colorado and Rep. Bobby Schilling in Illinois.	2	1	2		4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	The House in July passed a bill that would help livestock producers who are losing money because of a widespread drought, but the Senate has declined to take that up, with Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow saying that similar benefits are included in the larger bill. Republicans Rehberg and Berg have countered Democratic attacks by saying the Senate should consider that legislation.	1	1	2		4

230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	The earliest known confirmed galaxy has been discovered with the help of cosmic lenses formed out of the warped fabric of space and time, researchers say.	2	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	This distant, ancient galaxy may have once helped clear out the murky fog that once filled the early universe, scientists added.	2	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Astronomers estimate that the universe began about 13.7 billion years ago during the Big Bang.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Recent findings suggest the first galaxies formed less than 500 million years after the universe's birth.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Little is known about the earliest galaxies since their light is very faint, given how far away they are.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	One tool researchers can use to peer at these galaxies are so-called gravitational lenses, magnifying glasses resulting from the warped fabric of reality.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Gravity curves space-time; the greater the mass of an object in space, the stronger its gravitational pull.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	This, in turn, bends light around it, affecting how telescopes on Earth view it.	1	1	1		4

230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Astronomers can gauge the age of an object by estimating its distance.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Since the speed of light appears the same throughout the universe, knowing how far away an object is reveals how long it took for its light to get here.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Scientists can work out the distance of an object by looking at how much the light from it is distorted.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Using gravitational lensing caused by one of the most massive known galaxy clusters, scientists glimpsed a galaxy that existed when the universe was about 500 million years old using two NASA space observatories: the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Based on its level of development, the researchers estimate this galaxy is about 150 million times the mass of the sun and formed less than 200 million years after the Big Bang.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	This is currently the earliest known and most distant galaxy that scientists have confidently identified.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	"We feel like archaeologists with a pre-Neanderthal fossil in hand," lead study author Wei Zheng, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University, told SPACE.com.	2	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Astronomers have detected potentially older galaxies, but their faintness makes it difficult to make out key details regarding their age.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	"Such a discovery would not have been possible if the object was un-lensed," Zheng said.	2	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	The age of this galaxy reveals it formed during the so-called "epoch of reionization" that occurred about 150 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang.	1	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	This critical but still largely mysterious event occurred when intense ultraviolet radiation cleared the fog of atomic hydrogen that once pervaded the cosmos by ionizing it into its constituent protons and electrons.	2	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	"This provides us with a unique glimpse of star formation and galaxy growth in the period spanning 300 [million] to 500 million years after the Big Bang," astronomer Daniel Stark at the University of Arizona at Tucson, who did not take part in this study, told SPACE.com.	2	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	"While caution should be exercised in the interpretation of a single object, the results presented in the Zheng paper point to significant star formation activity throughout this period."	2	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Much remains uncertain as to what sources of radiation caused the epoch of reionization.	2	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	Since the researchers found this ancient galaxy after only monitoring a small patch of sky, Zheng said the early universe may have overall been rich with galaxies that drove reionization.	2	1	1		4	
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	The scientists detailed their findings in the Sept. 20 issue of the journal Nature.	1	1	1		4

231	feds-40-billion-monthly-mbs-buys-delivers-maximum-203407748--business	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve figures that $40 billion in monthly purchases of mortgage-backed securities is the most it can buy without disrupting the market, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said on Monday.	2	1	1			
231	feds-40-billion-monthly-mbs-buys-delivers-maximum-203407748--business	Any more, he said, and market functioning could be disrupted because the Fed would dominate the purchases of new securities; any less, he said, would have less than maximum impact.	2	1	2			
231	feds-40-billion-monthly-mbs-buys-delivers-maximum-203407748--business	The U.S. central bank this month said it would keep up its purchases of housing-backed assets until the labor market improves substantially, and would do even more if that standard is not met.	1	1	2			
231	feds-40-billion-monthly-mbs-buys-delivers-maximum-203407748--business	The Fed is also buying Treasuries in its Operation Twist program, in which the Fed buys long-term Treasuries and sells a like amount of short-term Treasuries.	1	1	1			
231	feds-40-billion-monthly-mbs-buys-delivers-maximum-203407748--business	"Twist" will expire at the end of the year.	1	1	1			
231	feds-40-billion-monthly-mbs-buys-delivers-maximum-203407748--business	Saying he doubts there will be "ongoing sustained and measurable improvement in a broad set of labor market conditions" by the end of the year, Williams said the Fed will revisit its decision on the level of its monthly asset purchases at that time.	1	1	1			
231	feds-40-billion-monthly-mbs-buys-delivers-maximum-203407748--business	Judging improvement in the job market will require a look at the unemployment rate as well as jobs gains and overall GDP growth, he said.	1	1	1

232	feds-evans-essential-much-now-economy-171548159--business	HAMMOND, Indiana (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Tuesday reiterated his support for the U.S. central bank's bold new push to lower borrowing costs and boost the so far "disappointing" recovery, and said the Fed should do even more.	2	2	2		4	
232	feds-evans-essential-much-now-economy-171548159--business	"This was the time to act," Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce Business Expo in the industrial Chicago suburb of Hammond, Ind. "With the problems we face and the potential dangers lying ahead, it is essential to do as much as we can now to bolster the resiliency and vibrancy of the economy."	3	2	2		4	
232	feds-evans-essential-much-now-economy-171548159--business	Evans' prepared remarks were the same he gave on Sept 18, less than a week after the Fed decided to embark on a third round of asset buying and said it would not let up until the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially.	3	3	1		4	
232	feds-evans-essential-much-now-economy-171548159--business	The central bank also said it would keep short-term interest rates near zero until at least mid-2015, even after policymakers expect it to show signs of strength.	2	2	1		4	
232	feds-evans-essential-much-now-economy-171548159--business	To boost the impact of its actions, the Fed should explicitly say that it will be just as tolerant of inflation running slightly above its 2-percent goal as it is about inflation running slightly below, Evans said.	2	2	2		4	
232	feds-evans-essential-much-now-economy-171548159--business	U.S. core inflation has run below 2 percent since 2008.	1	1	1		4	
232	feds-evans-essential-much-now-economy-171548159--business	Unemployment, at 8.1 percent, is well above the 5.5 percent to 6 percent that many economists believe is normal for the economy in the long run.	1	1	1		4	
232	feds-evans-essential-much-now-economy-171548159--business	"We should not be resistant to policies that could move the unemployment rate closer its longer-run level, but run the risk of inflation running only a few tenths above our 2 percent goal," he said.	2	2	2		4

233	femininity-factor-070000657	The Femininity Factor	3	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Are Republican women politicians more "feminine" than Democratic women politicians?	2	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	That's the conclusion of a new study by UCLA researchers, who found that Republican women are so much more "feminine" that college students were able to accurately predict party affiliation just by looking at the woman.	2	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	The "Michele Bachmann" effect, they call it.	3	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Of course, Bachmann did not fare very well in her presidential campaign, although I think that was for reasons having nothing to do with her facial features.	4	1	2		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Neither did Sarah Palin, whom most men I know (but fewer women) consider to be very attractive.	1	2	2		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	The authors also point out that being feminine isn't necessarily a positive for women, since studies have found that people tend to think of women as either feminine or competent, but not both.	1	1	2		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	My own review of the studies, over the past 20 years, suggests that the issue is far more nuanced.	4	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Some years ago, a woman who was passed over for a promotion at a Big Eight accounting firm brought suit for gender discrimination after she was told that changing her hairstyle and dressing in a more feminine style might improve her chances the following year.	1	1	2		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Her claim that this amounted to sex discrimination was upheld by the Supreme Court, which means that no one says things like that anymore, much less writes them down.	2	2	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	But do they think it?	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Absolutely.	5	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	I remember an article from a few years ago in which women CEOs were interviewed, and every one of them, literally, was pictured in pastel colors.	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Yellow was the hands-down favorite.	4	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	So cheerful and non-threatening.	4	2	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	For women seeking top positions, the challenge is to appear feminine, but not too feminine; assertive, but not too aggressive; attractive, but not too sexy.	3	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	My women students openly admit that they dress for interviews like dates, hoping to look their best: makeup, high heels, a well-fitting suit that shows off their figure.	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	And I always tell them to make sure to wear a shirt under the suit jacket.	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Form fitting, yes.	3	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Cleavage, no.	3	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	One year, a group of my students went to a local mall, showed pictures of women they had clipped from a magazine to shoppers and asked them which one they thought was a CEO and which a sales clerk.	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	The one who looked like a model was thought to be neither; the gal with the pleasing features and short blond bob was the CEO; the overweight woman was the store clerk.	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Big surprise.	4	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	I also remember a piece done by a conservative activist comparing the women Democrats who appear on television with their Republican counterparts.	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	The writer's point (helped along by his rather skewed choice of pictures) was how much better looking the Republicans were.	4	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	I don't claim to be a beauty, but I've never seen a worse shot of myself.	5	1	2		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	And the fact that many of these women were chosen precisely because of how they look, rather than because of what they know, was entirely ignored.	2	1	2		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	(After all, does anyone really listen to TV? No, they watch.)	3	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	I don't know whether the UCLA students would consider Nancy Pelosi to be feminine.	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	I do.	5	2	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Geraldine Ferraro?	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Absolutely.	5	2	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Hillary Clinton?	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Who would even ask that question about a woman who has been a role model for young women of all political persuasions, a woman who is admired around the world?	4	3	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	The fact that serious academics would conduct such a study, and that it would be published in a peer-reviewed journal, gives me pause — and not so much about them (such studies are apparently part of a burgeoning field of research called "social vision," which is not limited to women's facial features), but about the fact that we continue to look at leadership this way.	3	1	2		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	The researchers note that it may be that Republican women's faces are more traditionally pretty because conservatives are more bound by gender stereotyping.	2	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Interestingly, they found Democratic men to be more masculine than Republican men, but considered this finding to be "less revealing" for reasons that the press release, at least, did not explain.	2	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	The fact that looks play a role in politics is nothing new.	2	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	John Kennedy won the first televised presidential debate among those watching it, while Richard Nixon won among those listening on the radio.	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	In most presidential elections, the taller candidate wins.	1	1	1		4	
233	femininity-factor-070000657	But for women especially, the tendency to make judgments based on looks distorts the issues that should govern, creating not simply a glass ceiling but also a mirrored one.	4	1	2		4

238	first-tee-roars-fine-bubba-bradley-says-no-201009589--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - For the second day, Masters champion Bubba Watson encouraged the overflowing crowd at the first tee of the Ryder Cup to roar through his swing and on Saturday England's Ian Poulter joined along in the fun.	1	2	1		4	
238	first-tee-roars-fine-bubba-bradley-says-no-201009589--golf	Watson and Poulter hit their opening drives amid wild cheering and the electric moment, replacing the usual dead quiet that most golfers demand while they swing the club, also fired up Ryder rookie sensation Keegan Bradley.	2	2	1		4

238	first-tee-roars-fine-bubba-bradley-says-no-201009589--golf	Bradley, who has been encouraging the Medinah crowds to roar after every U.S. success, said high decibels from the spectators helped Watson perform, but was probably not best for him.	2	2	1		4

239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	If you've been following the media trail on fish oil lately, you've probably been tempted to forgo the smelly capsules. A systematic review of 20 studies published last week in JAMA The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that neither eating extra helpings of fish nor taking fish oil supplements reduces the risk of stroke, heart attack or death. In June a review of studies published on behalf of the Cochrane Collaboration, an independent, not-for-profit organization that promotes evidence-based decision-making, concluded that fish oil pills fail to prevent or treat cognitive decline. And a 2011 meta-analysis by Yale University researchers debunked the idea that omega-3s alleviate depression. These proclamations run counter to what we have been told about fish and fish oil for decades. So why is the consensus changing? Is it time for us to toss out our pills for good?	3	1	3			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	Not necessarily. Although it's true that early research on fish oil seemed far more promising—one 1999 trial, for instance, reported that people who took omega-3 pills were 10 percent less likely to have a heart attack, stroke or die from cardiac disease than people who did not—some researchers think that recent negative findings reveal more about us than they do about fish oil. Omega-3 pills may be beneficial for certain people but not for others, they say, and existing studies may not account for individual differences.	1	3	2			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	There's no question that polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids—the technical name for the good fats found in fish and fish oil—are important parts of a healthy diet. Our bodies can't make them, yet we need them to survive, as they form part of our cell membranes. Although the mechanism by which they might prevent heart disease, cognitive decline and depression isn't well understood, research suggests that they reduce blood pressure and inflammation and that they increase brain blood flow and give neurons structural strength.	1	3	2			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	And no one questions the World Health Organization's recommendation (pdf) that pregnant and nursing women should consume at least 300 milligrams of omega-3s daily to boost fetal brain development. "That [benefit] has been clearly demonstrated in trials," says Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at Harvard University, who studies fish oil.	2	3	1			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	But for other adults, the health benefits of supplementing have become much harder to gauge. That's in part because many of us get lots of these good fats from our diet anyway: According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, per capita fish consumption has doubled (pdf) since 1961, and "more consumption doesn't really add much bang for your buck," Mozaffarian says. In other words, adding more omega-3s to an already omega-3–rich diet does not do much good, a fact that could help explain why recent studies have been more equivocal than studies from several decades ago, when fish was less popular. "We have no evidence from populations whose dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids may be low and who may therefore benefit from supplementation," says Alan Dangour, head of the nutrition group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and co-author of the recent Cochrane review. In addition, preliminary research suggests that certain ethnic groups—such as Japanese and Italians—may benefit more from omega-3 supplements than others, perhaps in part because of how well their bodies absorb the fats.	2	2	2			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	Another potential problem is that most of the research on fish oil and heart health—including all of the trials included in the recent JAMA analysis—have involved subjects who already have heart disease or established risk factors. Whereas this isn't necessarily a problem in itself, it means that very little research has addressed whether fish oil supplements benefit healthy people. "The jury is still out on whether omega-3 supplements can prevent a first cardiovascular event in people at usual risk," says JoAnn Manson, an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who is conducting a trial to answer this question, which she estimates will be finished in 2016.	1	1	3			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	Moreover, because so many trials have involved subjects with heart problems, subjects in recent years have been "taking multiple medications, such as aspirin and statins, which can obscure the effects of supplements," Manson says. (Half of the studies included in the JAMA analysis were conducted after statins became commonplace.) This fact could also help explain the outcome discrepancies between recent trials and older ones carried out during the pre-statin era. Indeed, a February 2012 analysis of a large European clinical trial reported that fish oil supplements do not prevent second heart attacks among people taking statins, but that it cuts risk by half among people who don't take the medications. (Because there were so few non-statin users enrolled in the trial, this finding did not quite reach statistical significance.)	1	2	3			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	People who enroll in and complete omega-3 trials may differ from typical Americans in important ways, too. "Members of the public who volunteer to join randomized controlled studies are frequently healthier and more active than the average for the population," Dangour says, which could affect outcomes in unknown ways. In addition, he adds, people who drop out of trials are often the sickest, and they might be the ones who would most benefit from supplementation.	2	2	3			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	There's also more than one type of fish oil. Typically, in omega-3 intervention studies, subjects take pills containing a near-equal mixture of two fats, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)—but some research suggests that in certain situations and for certain outcomes, one may be better than the other. For instance, a 2011 meta-analysis concluded that fish oil capsules don't help treat depression, but a group of British and Norwegian researchers challenged these findings, citing evidence that pills containing at least 60 percent EPA do seem to provide mood benefits. Another controversial question is whether the omega-3 dose is important in and of itself or whether the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fats one consumes is more important. (Although omega-6 fats are important for survival, Americans tend to consume far more of these fats than they need.)	1	2	2			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	Finally, whereas the recent JAMA analysis concluded that fish oil has no effect on cardiovascular outcomes, the researchers did find that omega-3s reduced the risk of cardiac death by 10 percent, an effect that was statistically significant (having a "p value" of 0.01). The researchers did not report the finding in their conclusions because they subsequently modified their statistical calculations to account for the fact that they had used the same data set to ask a number of different "exploratory" questions: In this case, does fish oil prevent heart attacks? Strokes? What about sudden cardiac death? The team wanted to tighten their definition of statistical significance to account for the fact that the more questions one asks, the more likely one is to get a positive result by chance. Still, Mozaffarian says, "if you combine all the data and look only at cardiac death, there is a statistically significant benefit. A 10 percent reduction in the number-one cause of death in both men and women in the U.S. is a big deal."	2	4	1			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	So, should you take fish oil pills or not? Most researchers agree that oily fish such as salmon and mackerel are far better way to get your fill of good fats. Many of the early, promising studies on omega-3s involved fish rather than fish oil pills (in one, men who were advised to eat fish were 29 percent less likely to die in the two years following a heart attack than men who were not), and a 2010 study by Columbia University scientists reported that following a Mediterranean diet—which, among other things, is rich in fatty fish—reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease by 34 percent. "Not only may people be benefiting from the omega-3 fatty acids in fish, but the fish may be displacing such foods as hamburgers and quiche from the diet, both high in saturated fat," explains Alice Lichtenstein, director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at Tufts University.	2	3	1			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	If you don't eat fish, then the question of what to do becomes more difficult. Researchers argue that, ultimately, we need more randomized, controlled clinical trials on omega-3 supplements—particularly in healthy people who don't take medications—but these are becoming rare, in part because the supplements will never be big moneymakers. "Generic fish oil is available, so drug companies don't have any strong motivation to fund trials," Mozaffarian says.	3	1	2			
239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	But despite the murky science, if you don't get omega-3s from other sources—or if you have heart disease risk factors but aren't taking medications—omega-3 pills may still be a good idea. "There's no harm in taking a fish oil supplement, and there could be benefits," Mozaffarian says. "The bottom line is that getting some [omega-3] is better than getting none."	2	3	2

240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	I first began to write this post on September 12, the day when Mitt Romney was supposed to don the fall collection of campaign clothing and start new and fresh.	4	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	And then Libya happened, and then the leaked videotape happened, and then came a crunch of state polls showing that almost all routes to electoral victory were blocked by a President with leads outside the margin of error.	3	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Gallup's tracking has provided the only comfort data for Boston, so perhaps that's a place to start.	3	2	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	But when your pollster has to tell the press not to believe the polls, you know you're looking at an uphill climb to the presidency.	3	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Romney has high hurdles ahead of him.	2	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	But his cause is not lost.	3	2	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Here are five ways he can still win.	2	2	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Some combination of the following events and contingencies will have to intrude upon the race for him to do so, but a Romney/Ryan administration remains within the realm of possibility.	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Keep in mind: there WILL be natural tightening (as opposed to the political Botox kind) between now and election day.	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	1. Romney has a stellar first debate, which galvanizes his campaign and allows late-breaking independents to finally see the man that Ann Romney so loves dearly.	3	3	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Likelihood: 60 percent.	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Every Romney route to victory has to include a great first debate, because the first debates tend to matter the most, and because Romney will have a relatively unfiltered opportunity to try to make his case, probably his last.	3	2	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Debate 1 is about domestic policy, and the economy is lackluster.	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	If ever there was a time to step up and force Barack Obama to explain to the American people just what he would do to create jobs -- if ever there was an opportunity to refocus the campaign back onto the jobs issue -- it's on October 3 at the University of Denver.	3	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	No doubt Romney will be prepared.	3	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Jim Lehrer, the moderator, is not going to throw anything Romney's way that he hasn't already anticipated.	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	2. Romney has a human moment.	1	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Likelihood: 40%.	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Yes, I know he is a human being, and I'm one of those reporters who has seen him when the camera is off and I can vouch for the fact that he isn't weird and stilted.	5	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	But he is so cautious on the campaign trail, so full of anxious energy, that even his scripted soft moments come off as somewhat silly.	3	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	So he needs someone to give him a bear-hug, or to shed a genuine tear, or to tell a dirty joke -- something entirely spontaneous that expands the comfort zone.	3	2	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	From the start, the Obama campaign has tried to portray Romney as too darn unusual to be the president, and that strategy has worked.	1	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Clint Eastwood's talking chair routine is not going to cut it.	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	You can hear my eyes roll in their sockets as I type words like "humanizing moment," but the incumbent here is much more of a fully formed character than the challenger, and for people who haven't made up their mind, that matters.	5	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	3. Convince Democrats that they're going to lose.	2	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Likelihood: 30%.	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	The more Democrats think they're going to win, the more enthusiasm their base will have, and the easier it will be for Obama to get to 270 electoral votes on the strength of only marginal independent turn-out.	2	2	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Romney needs to someone juice the game to scare Democrats into thinking that they're going to lose, which will set the ball rolling in the opposite direction.	3	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Campaign cues, even what ridiculous anonymous strategists whisper to reporters, matter a lot.	4	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Voters pick up on them.	1	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	At the very least, Romney's campaign needs to enforce messaging standards that DON'T acknowledge the reality that Obama has an edge, and he needs to (somehow) get party strategists who dislike him and are signed on with potential 2016 candidates to shut their traps.	4	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	4. Iran does something stupid and dangerous; Israel attacks Iran unilaterally.	3	1	3			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Likelihood: 40%.	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	This is a huge unknown, and it's unseemly to speculate about anything that would involve death and destruction.	2	1	3			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	But the moment Americans become uncomfortable with the way their commander-in-chief handles foreign policy crisis is the moment the challenger can step in with a better solution.	2	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Unfortunately, Romney has been fairly vacuous when it comes to foreign policy in general.	3	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	5. The Medicare argument works.	1	2	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Likelihood: 10%.	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	President Obama's $716b Medicare ... call it an adjustment ... remains a viable political opportunity for Romney, albeit a very risky one.	2	2	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Though the Affordable Care Act cuts payments to hospitals and to private insurers that subsidize special add-on plans to Medicare (Medicare Advantage), it could well persuade a number of doctors to stop accepting Medicare in the first place.	2	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Eventually, the market will even out access, but in the short term, there is a grain (but just a grain) of truth in what the Republican ticket likes to say about Medicare.	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	Ignoring the larger truth that Romney-Ryan's plan does a lot more damage to the product, enough scared seniors could swing states like Florida, Iowa, Nevada and Wisconsin.	2	1	3			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	There is no linear path to victory right now for Romney.	2	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	That has reality-based Republicans scared out of their wits.	2	1	2			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	It has others, like Tim Pawlenty, scrambling for the exits (gracefully).	2	1	1			
240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	For now, the rest can only grin and bear it.	3	2	2

245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	A new study on the genomics of breast cancer confirms that there are four distinct genetic types of the disease, suggesting that some drugs already used to treat cancer in other parts of the body could possibly be used to treat certain forms of breast cancer that share the same genetic abnormalities.	2	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	The researchers, whose findings were published Sunday in the journal Nature, studied the DNA of breast cancer tumors of 825 patients at various stages of the disease, and found that the disease could be stratified into four major genetic categories.	1	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	The study, a collaborative effort between 348 researchers, is part of a larger project known as the Cancer Genome Atlas, which is mapping the genetic changes in 20 cancers, including breast cancer.	1	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	The new study, part of the largest breast cancer genomic project, offers the largest pool of data for researchers who have known for decades that there were genetic subtypes of breast cancer.	1	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	"This again reconfirms on a larger scale the heterogeneity that exists between each patient's breast cancer," said Dr. Ben Park, associate professor of oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.	2	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	Park was not involved in the study.	1	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	The genetic analysis not only included a comprehensive look at the inherited basis for the cancers but also examined how proteins expressed within the genes affected the type of cancers that were classified.	1	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	"We now understand the recoding of the genome that is behind [these cancers]," said Dr. Matthew Ellis, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, and a researcher on the study.	2	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	The Cancer Genome Atlas work "lays the foundation for a new and much more informed approach to developing cures for all our patients," he said.	2	2	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	In particular, researchers found that one type of the disease, more commonly known as triple negative breast cancer, genetically resembles a form of ovarian cancer that is currently treatable.	1	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive and deadly form of the disease that responds to chemotherapy but has high rates of relapse.	1	1	3		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	But clinicians caution that it will take years for these initial genetic findings to change the course of treatment for breast cancer, which is expected to kill nearly 40,000 women in 2012, according to the American Cancer Society.	2	1	2		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	"You would need to treat a large number of patients with this profile to see whether the hypothesis works," said Dr. Jay Brooks, chairman of the department of hematology and oncology at Ochsner Clinic Foundation and Hospital in Baton Rouge, La.	2	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	Brooks was not affiliated with the study.	1	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	According to many breast cancer experts, the findings confirm that cancers should be defined and treated according to their genetic components rather than their location in the body.	2	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	"For a lot of physicians, breast cancer is breast cancer is breast cancer.	2	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	And the problem is, it isn't," said Brooks.	2	1	2		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	"This is the future of the way we will identify malignancies and the best sort of therapy."	2	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	These classifications may eventually guide clinicians to prescribe more personalized treatments for breast cancer patients according to the type of the disease they have.	2	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	"Certainly breast cancer patients will want to know whether this study leads to a different clinical approach to the management of their disease, and for now, this is not the case," said Brooks.	3	1	1		4	
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	For now, the genomic information offers researchers a more definitive understanding of breast cancer, and hope that once the specific type is identified in a patient, a clinician can, eventually, offer an arsenal of personalized treatments.	1	2	1		4

248	france-germany-seek-common-position-eads-bae-125648476--finance	For Britain, the key is to ensure that the creation of a European group would not affect BAE's strong sales in the United States, which have benefited from the "special relationship" between the two countries.	2	2	1		4

249	frances-muhammad-cartoons-divert-anger-away-u-175400907	A French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, has published several offensive caricatures of Islam's Prophet Muhammad, threatening to fuel outrage in the Muslim world first sparked by an obscure anti-Islam film made in the U.S. The Parisian weekly had intended to mock the violent response to the video, with a cover featuring "an Orthodox Jew pushing a turbaned Muhammad in a wheelchair and the headline: 'You must not laugh.'"	2	1	2		4

253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	It allows people living in the European Union and eventually the U.S. to invest equity into games, and receive returns on their investment.	1	2	1		3	
253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	Unlike Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, however, Gambitious doesn't let just anyone submit a project for funding.	1	1	1		3

253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	Much of this Kickstarter gold rush has to do with developer Double Fine's uber-successful campaign to make a point-and-click adventure game.	1	1	1		3	
253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	The company raised $3.3 million back in February, and Kickstarter has said seven of the first 10 projects to reach the $1 million funding goal were game-related.	1	1	1		3	
253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	Miller says quick success has given independent developers big dreams, but adds that they may not have the ability or money to fulfill them all.	1	2	2		3	
253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	Many costs that crop up later surprise the developers, he says, such as marketing, or even creating special rewards for Kickstarter backers.	1	2	1		3

253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	"It's really hard to get noticed on Kickstarter, and it's a full-time job of the developer to make sure the campaign runs smoothly," he says.	1	1	2		3	
253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	With Gambitious, Wilson and Miller say their goal is to make sure smaller developers, especially first-timers, understand what they are getting into, while also making sure the game's consumers can donate or invest in a basic business plan, at minimum.	1	1	1		3	
253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	"It's not to say that a team of inexperienced people can't do this, but we want to make sure they have a plan," Wilson says, adding that Gambitious already has contracts with marketing, public relations, voice acting and music services.	1	1	1		3	
253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	The duo will soon have another group to educate: potential investors.	1	1	1		3	
253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	Wilson says the passage of the JOBS Act means that it will only be a few months before U.S. residents can invest in private companies.	1	1	1		3	
253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	Investors on Gambitious can only invest in the game the company is making -- not the developers themselves -- but they can still get returns if a game sells well.	1	2	1		3

256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Defying expectations, President Mikhail Saakashvili conceded Tuesday that his party had lost Georgia's parliamentary election and his opponent had the right to become prime minister, setting the stage for political turmoil in the final year of his presidency.	3	1	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	The new Georgian government will be led by billionaire businessman and philanthropist Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia and until recently was little known to the 4.5 million people in his homeland on the Black Sea.	1	1	1			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	In one notable accomplishment, it was the first time in Georgia's post-Soviet history that the government changed by the ballot box rather than through revolution. Saakashvili came to power through the peaceful Rose Revolution after a rigged parliamentary vote in 2003.	3	3	2			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	By conceding defeat even before the results of Monday's election were released, the 44-year-old Saakashvili defied the opposition's expectations that he would cling to power at all costs and preserved his legacy as a pro-Western leader who brought democracy to the former Soviet republic.	3	3	2			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	He also prevented potential violence on the emotionally charged streets of the capital, Tbilisi, where support for the opposition Georgian Dream coalition is strongest. Opposition supporters began celebrating as soon as the polls closed, and the mood could have turned ugly very quickly if they thought they were being deprived of a victory.	3	3	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	The 56-year-old Ivanishvili, meanwhile, went immediately on the attack. Speaking at a televised news conference, he declared that most of the president's widely praised reforms were a joke and said Saakashvili had deceived the Americans into believing he was a democrat. He then called on Saakashvili to resign.	3	1	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	"I don't think our political battle was caused by any personal antagonism on my part toward Saakashvili," he said. "But I have always blamed Saakashvili for what has gone wrong in Georgia, and I can repeat that today: This man's ideology has established a climate of lies, violence and torture."	4	1	4			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	During his nearly nine years in power, Saakashvili has pushed through economic and political reforms and attracted international investment that has led to dramatic economic growth. Poverty and unemployment, however, remain painfully high.	3	3	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	Still, many Georgians have turned against Saakashvili in recent years. Many accuse his United National Movement party — which has controlled not only the government and Parliament but also the courts and prosecutor's office — of exercising authoritarian powers.	1	1	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	Saakashvili's campaign was also hit hard by the release two weeks ago of shocking videos showing prisoners in a Tbilisi jail being beaten and sodomized. The government moved quickly to stem the anger, replacing Cabinet ministers blamed for the abuse and arresting prison staff, but many saw the videos as illustrating the excesses of his government.	3	3	5			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	In his televised concession speech, the president said there were deep differences between his party and the diverse opposition coalition.	2	1	1			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	"We think their views are completely wrong," he said. "But democracy works through the majority of the Georgian people making a decision, and we respect this very much."	3	2	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	Saakashvili will remain as the leader of Georgia until his second and last term ends in October 2013. Under a constitutional reform that goes into effect after he leaves office, many of the president's powers will be transferred to the prime minister, who is chosen by Parliament.	1	1	1			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	Alexander Rondeli, a Georgian political analyst, said the antagonism between Saakashvili and his future prime minister threatened to create a political storm.	3	1	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	"Both the president and Ivanishvili have stated, not very willingly, but they have stated their readiness to work together," Rondeli said. "But on Ivanishvili's team are people who, metaphorically speaking, want Saakashvili's head. Whether he will be able to resist their influence only time will tell."	3	2	4			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	Saakashvili was under pressure to hold a democratic election and prevent the kinds of violations believed to have boosted his results in the past. This message was reinforced by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during a visit in June, when she told him that the "the single best thing Georgia can do to advance your security, your prosperity, your democracy, your international reputation, is to hold free and fair elections that result in a fully democratic transition."	2	3	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	More than 400 international observers monitored the election. They expressed concern over the harsh rhetoric during the campaign and isolated cases of violence, but said Tuesday the election process had showed "a healthy respect for fundamental freedoms at the heart of democratic elections."	3	3	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	Ivanishvili has confirmed his commitment to pursue Saakashvili's goals of making Georgia an integral part of Europe and member of NATO, while adding he will seek to restore the trade and diplomatic ties with Russia that were severed when the two countries fought a brief war in 2008.	1	3	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	Georgian producers of wine, mineral water, vegetables and fruits had depended on exports to Russia, and the closing of those markets hurt them deeply.	2	1	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	The businessman has denied Saakashvili's accusations that he intends to put Georgia back under Russian domination.	2	2	2			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	Before Saakashvili conceded, Ivanishvili met with two U.S. senators to assure them of his desire to maintain the close relationship with Washington that Saakashvili forged.	1	2	1			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	"We talked about the future, how to develop our relationship with our big friend (the United States), and how to develop democracy in Georgia," he said after meeting with Republican Sen. James Risch of Idaho and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, both members of the Foreign Relations Committee.	3	3	1			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	In Russia, where the election was being watched closely, the government welcomed Saakashvili's defeat. He and Russian President Vladimir Putin have had a deep enmity since the 2008 war that left Georgia battered.	3	3	3			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the opposition victory would bring "more constructive and responsible" people to parliament. He said the Kremlin political party was "ready for dialogue about the future of Russian-Georgian relations."	4	4	1			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	Alexei Malashenko, a scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center, was more cautious.	2	1	2			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	"For a while, ties will soften, there will be a prospect of improvement, but an exchange of embassies is not possible yet," he said.	2	2	2			
256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	One of the main obstacles is the status of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which Russia has recognized as independent. Georgia lost its last remaining territory in both provinces as a result of the 2008 war and bristles at the Russian troops stationed there.	1	1	3

258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	BERLIN (AP) — The leaders of France and Germany both stressed Saturday that Europe must further deepen its political and economic integration to ensure peace and continuous prosperity across the continent.	2	2	1			
258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	French President Francois Hollande met Chancellor Angela Merkel in the southwestern German city of Ludwigsburg to celebrate an important anniversary of their countries' reconciliation following the end of World War II.	1	2	1			
258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	"France and Germany have a very special responsibility, we form the heart of Europe," said Hollande, adding that the European Union's status quo can only be seen as the starting point for a deeper integration.	3	1	1			
258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	"Stopping would mean falling back.	3	1	2			
258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	We don't have a choice, but to march toward the destiny that is ours, march toward a unified Europe," he added.	3	1	2			
258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	Europe's 17-nation currency zone is experiencing a deep crisis, Hollande said, therefore urging Germany and other nations to help "create instruments that make us stronger: the budgetary union, the banking union, the social union, a political union."	3	2	3			
258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	Merkel said both countries will and must work together closely to strengthen Europe to weather those new challenges.	2	1	1			
258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	"However great the economic challenges may be.	3	1	2			
258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	It remains and will remain valid: We Europeans are united in the pursuit of our happiness," she said.	3	2	1			
258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	France's then-leader Charles de Gaulle in 1962 addressed German youth in Ludwigsburg — speaking in German — in a speech that was hailed as a major step toward building German-French ties, after the nations had fought each other in both world wars, and were often referred to as arch-enemies.	2	1	2			
258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	De Gaulle and his German counterpart Konrad Adenauer started the reconciliation efforts in the aftermath of World War II.	1	1	1			
258	german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706	Merkel said the two leaders, who had witnessed themselves the horrors of war, laid the foundation of Europe's unification in bringing together their nations "who were long said to be arch-enemies — what a terrible word."	2	1	4

259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	The existence of the cell, calling itself the Nationalist Socialist Underground (NSU), only came to light by chance after two members committed suicide following a botched bank robbery, and a female accomplice torched an apartment used by the gang.	1	1	3		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	Germany plans an overhaul its intelligence services in the wake of the NSU murders, but some experts say what is needed most is a fundamental change in approach in a country whose Nazi past makes right-wing militancy a sensitive subject.	1	1	2		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	"The new database will be of use, but it doesn't help with the fundamental problem which is that this data must be properly scrutinized, and immediately investigated.	3	2	2		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	The fact this didn't happen is what led to the catastrophic failures," said Hajo Funke, an expert on Germany's far-right.	2	1	2		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	Underestimating the far-right threat is a long running trend, he said.	2	1	2		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	"For too long intelligence agencies saw the enemy elsewhere.	3	1	2		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	During Cold War times they monitored the leftists, anarchists and punks.	1	1	1		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	The far right simply wasn't on their radar.	3	1	1		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	In some quarters there may have also been some sympathy for the far-right within their ranks."	3	1	1		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	Since late last year a depressing picture has emerged of missed chances and missed leads as the group engaged in a killing spree from 2000-2007, murdering eight Turks, a Greek and a German policewoman.	3	1	4		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	Authorities hope the new register will ensure intelligence on far-right extremists is properly shared between the police forces and domestic intelligence services across German states.	2	2	1		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	The register is modeled on a database of radical Islamists that has been in operation for several years.	1	1	1		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	"The aim of this is to develop an effective fight against far-right extremism in this country ... and in this way to ensure that what has happened can never happen again," Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said at the launch of the register in eastern Berlin.	2	2	1		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	However obstacles faced by an inquiry into the killings show that progress may be difficult.	2	1	2		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	The probe has been undermined by agencies withholding or even destroying information.	2	1	2		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	In July the head of Germany's domestic intelligence service resigned after admitting that an official within his agency had shredded files on the NSU.	1	1	2		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	This week Berlin's Interior Senator expressed regret for not sharing with the inquiry that an informant of the Berlin Office of Criminal Investigation had warned years earlier that he had information about the NSU.	2	1	2		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has apologized to the families of the murder victims for the catalogue of neglect and errors, said on Monday the inquiry was not proceeding as it should.	2	1	2		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	Experts say far-right extremism is a particular threat among disenchanted young people in Germany's eastern regions where unemployment is high.	2	1	2		4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	Police have reopened all unsolved cases with a possible racist motive since 1998 amid fears that security services underplayed the far-right threat, or used unreliable informants.	2	1	2		4

260	germanys-top-mail-order-pharmacy-files-insolvency-180612183	FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Sanicare, Germany's largest mail-order pharmacy, has filed for insolvency due to problems that have arisen following the recent death of its founder and head, the company said on Wednesday.	1	1	3		4	
260	germanys-top-mail-order-pharmacy-files-insolvency-180612183	A statement said the insolvency was for the mail-order pharmacy activities of the company and would not affect the rest of Sanicare's businesses, which include the online unit.	1	1	1		4	
260	germanys-top-mail-order-pharmacy-files-insolvency-180612183	The mail-order business would be run by court-appointed administrator Ralph Buenning after the family of founder and former head Johannes Moenter filed for insolvency on September 25 with the court in Osnabrueck city.	1	1	1		4	
260	germanys-top-mail-order-pharmacy-files-insolvency-180612183	The statement quoted Buenning as saying he was looking for an investor for the mail-order unit, which employs 342 staff.	1	1	1		4	
260	germanys-top-mail-order-pharmacy-files-insolvency-180612183	Buenning said the insolvency has arisen due to complexities of the company's organizational structure as well as uncertainties surrounding the will of Moenter, who died on September 4.	1	1	2		4	
260	germanys-top-mail-order-pharmacy-files-insolvency-180612183	According to the website of the European Association of Mail Service Pharmacies, its member Sanicare holds the market leader position in Germany, with nearly 1.2 million customers in the country.	1	2	1		4	
260	germanys-top-mail-order-pharmacy-files-insolvency-180612183	It said in 2009 the Sanicare Group had sales of 427 million euros ($548.27 million), with the mail-order business alone generating 197 million euros.	1	2	1		4

261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	ATLANTA, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Britain's Justin Rose sank a curling birdie putt from 52 feet at the par-three last to grab an early one-shot lead in Thursday's opening round of the elite Tour Championship.	3	3	1			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	The Englishman watched in amazement as his ball dropped into the cup after breaking sharply from left to right downhill to cap a four-under-par 66 at East Lake Golf Club.	3	3	1			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	While world number one Rory McIlroy and 14-times major winner Tiger Woods attracted the biggest galleries of the day in the final pairing, Rose covered the back nine in three under to take control of the PGA Tour's fourth and final playoff event.	3	3	1			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	Long-hitting Scott Piercy, who briefly led the elite 30-man field by two strokes before double-bogeying the 18th, carded a 67 to finish level with fellow American Bo Van Pelt.	3	2	1			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	Australian Adam Scott and Americans Hunter Mahan and Robert Garrigus opened with 68s while Ryan Moore and tour veteran Jim Furyk, also of the United States, returned 69s.	1	1	1			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	FedExCup points leader McIlroy, bidding for a fifth PGA Tour victory this year, and his fourth in just five starts, was at one under after 12 holes. Woods was at three under.	1	2	1			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	Rose, who clinched his fourth PGA Tour victory at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in March, was delighted to limit potential damage arising from erratic form off the tee with a sizzling putting display.	4	3	2

261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	"You've got to keep a much bigger premium of hitting it on the fairway here, and I didn't do a great job of that today," Rose told reporters after missing seven of 14 fairways while totalling only 26 putts.	2	1	2			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	"That's something I can improve on in the next few rounds. If I keep it on the fairway, I feel my iron game and short game is coming around.	3	2	1			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	"I'm beginning to get some confidence with the putter, so it was nice to get out of today with a hot start, considering that."	2	3	1			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	For Rose to land the season-long FedExCup and its $10 million bonus, he knows he is a long shot who has to win the Tour Championship and hope that players ranked higher in the points standings finish poorly.	1	3	2			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	Rose was 24th at the start of the week while any of the top five - McIlroy, Woods, Nick Watney, Phil Mickelson and Brandt Snedeker - would automatically secure the trophy with victory on Sunday.	1	3	1			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	"Just being here at this tournament is a good feeling," said Rose. "Obviously, I'd like to be much higher up the rankings.	3	3	2			
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	"Last year I didn't factor in the tournament and this year maybe being a little bit looser out there is going to help me.	1	2	1

264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Three of the four American rookies who seized the Ryder Cup spotlight with their fearless play slipped into the shadows during the decisive singles on Sunday, as Europe claimed a shock victory.	3	2	3		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	Webb Simpson, Brandt Snedeker and Keegan Bradley became instant Ryder Cup darlings with their dazzling debut in the opening foursomes and fourballs on Friday but were mostly invisible on Sunday as Europe stormed back from a 10-6 deficit to take the trophy.	3	2	3		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	The first-timers, who had formed the backbone of the American's 5-3 first day lead and made significant contributions on day two, failed to deliver in the last day pressure cooker with Jason Dufner the only rookie to record a win beating Sweden's Peter Hanson two up.	2	3	3		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	"It's hard not to get up in front of these fans with so much at stake in the singles," Dufner told reporters.	3	1	2		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	"I made a couple of nice putts there that kind of got me fired up a little bit.	3	2	1		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	"Excited to get that point for the team."	3	3	1		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	Bradley had led the American Ryder Cup team, forming an electrifying partnership with Phil Mickelson that generated three points from three matches but on their own both came up short on Sunday.	3	4	1		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	Bradley absorbed his first Ryder Cup loss falling 2&1 to world number one Rory McIlroy while Mickelson lost one down to Justin Rose in his 38th Ryder Cup match, the most by an American in the biennial competition.	1	2	1		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	Before the Europeans had popped the corks on their champagne, the post-mortem on the 14-1/2 to 13-1/2 loss had begun with Love being quizzed about his move to sit down the red-hot Bradley and Mickelson from Saturday's fourball that may have cost his team a valuable point.	3	3	2		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	"In hindsight, we would have done a lot of things differently, I guess," said Love. "These guys asked to do certain things during the week and there are some guys that didn't want to sit out; but guys that felt like they needed to rest, we let them rest.	3	2	3		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	"I'm going to second guess myself for a long time.	3	1	3		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	Could have done a lot of things differently."	3	1	3		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	One thing Love will not regret is having four rookies on his squad, Bradley (3-1-0), Dufner (3-1-0), Simpson (2-2-0) and Snedeker (1-2-0) combining to contribute nine points to the U.S. cause.	3	2	2		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	In fact it was the senior members of the team who failed to hold up their end, Jim Furyk (1-2-0), Steve Stricker (0-4-0) and Tiger Woods (0-3-1) managing just one-and-a-half points between them.	2	1	2		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	"I tried to remind the guys a little bit yesterday, even after the third session, that the tournament was not even halfway over yet point wise," said Love. "We had a long way to go.	3	1	1		4	
264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	"We tried to not focus on results but we talked about it a little bit last night; that all we could do was just go out, play one match at a time, everybody go out and have fun, try to win their point.	3	3	1		4

266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	Until Apple took the crown in 2010, Microsoft spent many, many years as the world's most valuable technology company.	3	2	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	And now, for the first time ever, Google has leapfrogged its Redmond-based rival, too, taking the second place slot behind Tim Cook and Co.'s best-selling iProducts, and relegating Microsoft to the bronze medal podium.	3	2	2		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	The search giant has enjoyed a strong run in recent months — share prices are up 30 percent for the quarter — and has now overtaken Microsoft's $247.27 billion market capitalization, clocking in at one point with a $248.89 billion market cap of its own.	3	2	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	(Apple is still way out in front, with a market cap well north of $600 billion.)	2	2	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	What accounts for Wall Street's renewed confidence in Google, which as recently as 2007 was seen as a risky investment?	2	1	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	Here, four theories:	1	1	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	1. Google has a vice-like grip on searchGoogle controls 66 percent of the U.S. search market, says Brian Womack at Bloomberg.	2	1	1	S	4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	Microsoft, which entered the search market in 2009 with Bing, comes in at a "distant second" with 16 percent.	1	1	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	And Google's stranglehold on search positions the company to become the biggest online display advertising company in the world.	2	2	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	Google's global revenue from online ads is likely to hit $6 billion this year, displacing even first-place Facebook, Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney tells Britain's Financial Times.	1	1	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	2. Microsoft's software business has been battered"The PC hardware business is obviously struggling," Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Wedge Partners Corp., tells Bloomberg.	2	1	2	S	4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	That's bad news for Microsoft, which has long made a ton of money with its PC operating system.	3	2	2		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	Although the company still gets most of its revenue from Windows and Office software, sales have slumped as more consumers turn to Android tablets or iPads to handle their home computing needs.	2	1	2		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	Simply put: Customers are looking to the Cloud, not the disk drive.	2	1	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	3. Microsoft has yet to prove it can go mobileWindows 8 is set to debut later this month, and while the new operating system "is designed to be Microsoft's first to translate tidily from PCs to smartphones and tablets, Microsoft has spent years failing to prove it gets mobile," says Marcus Wohlsen at Wired.	2	1	2	S	4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	Yes, "Windows 8 looks promising, but it's hard not to picture Microsoft as an old silverback with its arms wrapped around an old Dell desktop."	2	1	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	As for Google...	1	1	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	4. Android is already everywhereThe search giant is "beating its chest with the success of Android," says Wired's Wohlsen.	2	1	2	S	4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	The mobile operating system runs on more than two-thirds of the world's smartphones shipped during the second quarter.	1	1	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	Windows Phone, on the other hand, ran on fewer than 4 percent of the devices shipped during the same period.	1	1	2		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	Today, Google is more than the king of search, says Nick Wingfield at The New York Times.	1	1	1		4	
266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	It took some time, but it's clearly that "Google is beginning to convince investors that it is more than a one-trick pony."	2	1	1		4

267	google-seen-taking-facebooks-crown-u-display-ads-014344483--sector	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc is set to become the biggest earner in U.S. display ads this year, taking the No. 1 rank away from Facebook Inc and cementing its dominant presence in online advertising.	1	2	2		4	
267	google-seen-taking-facebooks-crown-u-display-ads-014344483--sector	Google's rising clout in display ads - the boxes with images and video found on websites -- has come on the back of growth in video advertising on its YouTube subsidiary, as well as mobile advertising through Admob, a company acquired by Google in 2009.	1	2	1		4	
267	google-seen-taking-facebooks-crown-u-display-ads-014344483--sector	This year, Google will claim 15.4 percent of display ad dollars, or $2.31 billion, compared to Facebook's 14.4 percent, or $2.16 billion, according to projections by eMarketer, a digital advertising research firm.	2	2	1		4	
267	google-seen-taking-facebooks-crown-u-display-ads-014344483--sector	But it added that publishers across the board have been bruised by weaker-than-expected display advertising demand this year as large brands withheld splurging on costly digital campaigns.	2	1	3		4

269	google-works-improve-based-rival-ios-6-maps-161538692	If the New York Times’ report from Tuesday is accurate, a native Google (GOOG) Maps app for iOS might not be released until the end of the year.	2	1	2		4	
269	google-works-improve-based-rival-ios-6-maps-161538692	For the time being, it would appear iOS 6 users can either switch to Android, deal with the issues until Apple fixes them or visit Google’s mobile Maps website for their mapping needs.	2	1	2		4	
269	google-works-improve-based-rival-ios-6-maps-161538692	The Web-based solution is not ideal and it’s much slower than a dedicated app, but using Google’s Maps website in Safari or any Web browser is still more accurate than Apple’s hot new mess.	3	2	3		4

270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	If a doctor diagnoses that crushing pain in your big toe as gout, relief just might be a bowl of cherries.	3	2	4			
270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	A new Boston University study has found that eating about 30 pieces of the sweet fruit within 48 hours of a gout attack may cut the risk of recurrence of the painful arthritic condition by 35 percent.	2	3	1			
270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	Though anecdotal evidence of gout-healing powers of cherries has been circulating since the 1950s, lead author Yuqing Zhang, professor of medicine and public health at Boston University, said he believed this was the first study to indicate that cherry consumption does indeed reduce gout flare ups.	3	3	1			
270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	In the study, 633 gout patients were followed online for one year and monitored for their gout symptoms, medications and risk factors as well as their intake of cherries and cherry extracts up to two days before a gout flare up. Eating up to three servings of cherries – about one and a half cups – appeared to be the magic number for preventing a gout attack.	3	2	1			
270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	"However, further cherry intake did not provide any additional beneficial effect," Zhang said.	2	1	2			
270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	Uric acid is a waste byproduct of metabolism which is normally excreted through the kidneys in urine. When the process is impaired, uric acid accumulates in the blood stream until crystals are deposited in the joints causing the pain, swelling and inflammation associated with gout. It usually attacks the big toes but can sometimes affect the rest of the foot, knees or ankles and less commonly, the elbows and shoulders.	1	1	4			
270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	More than 8.3 million Americans suffer from the disease. Men, especially older obese men, are the most susceptible though a woman's risk increases after menopause. In earlier studies, Zhang and his team showed that alcohol consumption, a high protein diet and foods such as shellfish which are rich in the chemical purine can also up gout frequency.	1	1	4			
270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	The secret behind cherries' gout-fighting powers isn't entirely understood. Dr. Allan Gelbar who co-wrote the commentary to the study in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism with Dr. Daniel Solomon, said it could be the vitamin C content of the fruit or perhaps the anti-inflammatory effect of their high antioxidant content.	1	2	1			
270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	"Anthocyanins are an antioxidant pigment found in cherries and other red and purple fruits and vegetables. They seem to stabilize the free radical molecules responsible for causing inflammation and cell and tissue damage."	1	2	1			
270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	Zhang said one limitation of the study is that it relied on the accuracy of each participant's recall of what they did and ate in the 48 hours before a gout attack. The next step would be to do a trial where some gout sufferers ate cherries while others did not.	1	1	2			
270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	Gelbar said that anyone who suffers from gout should consider adding cherries to their diet as a preventative measure but shouldn't stop taking their medication. Patients in the study who ate cherries and also took the uric-acid reducing drug, allopurinol, lowered their risk of gout recurrence by up to 75 percent.	2	3	1			
270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	And, although the study also found cherry extract was useful for lowering the number of gout attacks, the researchers stressed that the sample size – only 15 people – was too small to draw definite conclusions. The FDA has sent a letter to various cherry-based product manufacturers warning them not to use the study results to make claims about the benefits of their products.	1	1	3

271	grand-jury-indicts-colorado-man-vacation-investment-scheme-214700372--finance	* Morrissey stated that the indictment was the result of a joint investigation with the Colorado Division of Securities.	2	1	1		4	
271	grand-jury-indicts-colorado-man-vacation-investment-scheme-214700372--finance	* According to the charges, Wellens allegedly took approximately $8.5 million from 19 different investors between 2006 and 2011, promoting vacation investment through his company, Continental Resort Homes.	2	1	2		4	
271	grand-jury-indicts-colorado-man-vacation-investment-scheme-214700372--finance	* Instead of using the investment money to purchase vacation properties, the district attorney reported, Wellens allegedly used the money for his personal expenses and other businesses.	2	1	2		4	
271	grand-jury-indicts-colorado-man-vacation-investment-scheme-214700372--finance	* According to a November, 2011, report in the Colorado Springs Gazette , the Colorado Division of Securities began investigating Wellens after he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy listing $36.4 million in liabilities owed to 76 creditors and $2.08 million in assets.	2	1	2		4	
271	grand-jury-indicts-colorado-man-vacation-investment-scheme-214700372--finance	* Wellens stated during a creditors' meeting that he took more than $2 million from an individual in order to build a vacation home in Mexico, the Gazette reported.	2	1	1		4

271	grand-jury-indicts-colorado-man-vacation-investment-scheme-214700372--finance	* The violation to the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act is a class 2 felony which carries a penalty for up to 48 years in prison and up to $1 million in fines, according to the Felony Guide for Colorado.	2	1	2		4	
271	grand-jury-indicts-colorado-man-vacation-investment-scheme-214700372--finance	The conspiracy charges are class 4 felonies, calling for two to 12 years in prison and up to $500,000 in fines.	1	1	2		4

272	group-claims-da-vinci-painted-early-mona-lisa-204936543	GENEVA (AP) — A Zurich-based foundation says it will prove to the world Thursday that Leonardo Da Vinci painted an earlier version of the Mona Lisa.	2	1	1		5	
272	group-claims-da-vinci-painted-early-mona-lisa-204936543	The Mona Lisa Foundation, which owns the "Isleworth Mona Lisa," says that after 35 years of research, experts believe it predates the famed 16th-century masterpiece by about a decade.	1	1	1		5	
272	group-claims-da-vinci-painted-early-mona-lisa-204936543	The Isleworth painting — likewise a portrait of a young woman with an enigmatic smile — is slightly larger, was painted on canvas and has brighter colors than the famed Louvre Museum masterpiece painted on wood.	1	1	1		5	
272	group-claims-da-vinci-painted-early-mona-lisa-204936543	The group is presenting its findings to reporters Thursday in Geneva.	1	1	1		5

274	guatemalan-massacre-suspect-extradited-us-025901850	Federal authorities say Jose Sosa Orantes was brought to the U.S. Friday from Canada, where he had been in custody on U.S. charges of lying about his role in Guatemala's war when he applied for American citizenship in 2008.	1	1	2		4

276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	The oceans are getting the red-carpet treatment with a new project from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution: HabCam, an optical imaging endeavor that provides researchers with a one-of-a-kind glimpse of the seafloor.	2	2	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	The "Cam" part of HabCam is a camera system that is towed over the ocean bottom along the continental shelf (where a continent drops off under the ocean) off the East Coast of the United States.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	The system snaps six images per second — that's a half-million images per day; then, a process corrects the color and an algorithm stitches the pictures together to create a giant panorama of the seafloor.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	Each day, HabCam can capture 100 nautical miles (185 kilometers) of ocean floor.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	Amber York, a biology research associate at Woods Hole who works on HabCam, told OurAmazingPlanet that pictures have already sparked her interest: She has spotted an anemone and a worm that could be new species.	1	2	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	"As a biologist, I think what excites me more than anything about this project is the ability to see these organisms in a large scale in their natural habitat," York said.	1	2	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	"A lot of these off-shore species are not as well-documented as the coastal ones on the beach.	2	1	2		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	It's intense detective work trying to identify them."	2	1	1		3

276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	HabCam's 2-megapixel camera is towed on a large metal skeleton by a 103-foot (31 meters) sea scallop trawler, above coastal regions of the Northeast, including Georges Bank, the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	To collect the photos, HabCam is towed from a ship and travels in patterns from zigzags to spirals through the ocean about 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) above the seafloor, collecting more than 40 million images in total.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	The newest version of the system also includes a side scan acoustics system that gathers information on seafloor roughness — something that is difficult to see with the photos alone.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	The pictures also give scientists a window into how marine life on the seafloor acts.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	In the past, biologists have used giant trawlers to scoop up critters and dump them on the deck of ships for analysis.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	The problem, York said, is that the creatures look different when they come up than they do in their natural habitat.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	"They may change their color as they come up, or they get broken up too much in the process," she said.	2	1	2		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	HabCam also gives a peek into the way the creatures live on the floor.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	For example, sea stars were thought to be relatively spread out, but York has noticed that they tend to gather in armies — she calls them hordes — and eat everything in their path as they move across a scallop field.	2	1	1		3

276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	The camera is helping scientists count scallops on the seafloor, and helping them understand the health of the ecosystem.	1	2	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	Right now, it's being used to count scallops in a way that is much more rigorous than previous methods.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	They want to create a quantifiable marker for the habitat, including factors such as species richness, diversity, the composition of the material the creatures live on, and ecosystem change through time and over different areas.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	HabCam will help create an historical baseline for the seafloor health to be evaluated in the future.	1	2	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	Of course, it's a lot of work sifting through all those images.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	To help, those running HabCam have reached out to the Citizen Science Alliance and launched an interactive website called "Seafloor Explorer," where people can help identify scallops, sea stars and other creatures in the pictures.	1	2	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	The project is starting with 100,000 images to annotate.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	"We are interested in finding out what is happening to the seafloor over time, but we also need help in identifying individuals in all the photos," York said.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	The research group is working on a system to train computers to classify the images, but first they need people power to interpret what they're seeing.	1	1	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	York is positively pumped over the future of the field.	2	2	1		3	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	"I think this is just the start of a whole field of research — imaging of marine life on the seafloor," she said.	2	2	1		3

Several Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, were killed in protests that have been linked to the film.	1	1	5			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	Despite the outrage it's not clear that the film actually exists; certainly a trailer for it does, but a trailer isn't a film. Investigation into the anti-Muslim "film" is ongoing, but as yet there seems to be no evidence that the film exists other than as a deadly hoax. People create hoaxes for many reasons, but when fraud mixes with religious fervor the results can range from the comical to the deadly.	2	1	3			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	Here's a look at seven religious hoaxes throughout history.	1	1	2			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	1. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion	1	1	1			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	Perhaps the most infamous and malicious religious hoax in history, "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion" is a book supposedly revealing a secret Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. It first appeared in Russia in 1905, and though the book has been completely discredited as a forgery, it is still in print and remains widely circulated.Many people have endorsed this religious hoax, including actor Mel Gibson, Adolf Hitler, and automaker Henry Ford, who in 1920 paid to have a half-million copies of the book published.

281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	2. The Shroud of Turin and Other Holy Relics	1	1	1			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	Though many believe that Italy's Shroud of Turin is the burial shroud of Jesus, there's compelling evidence the shroud is in fact a hoax, including a 1389 letter from French Bishop Pierre d'Arcisto Pope Clement stating that a painter confessed to creating it. Indeed, the Bishop's evidence was so convincing that even Pope Clement acknowledged it as a forgery — one of countless faked religious relics circulating at the time. Carbon dating of the Shroud of Turin revealed it does not date back to the time of Christ but instead 14 centuries later — exactly when the forger confessed to making it. Even more damning for its authenticity, there is no record of its existence before then; if it really is the burial shroud of Jesus Christ, it seems suspicious that no one knew anything about it for 1,300 years. Though many remain convinced of its authenticity, the historical and scientific evidence suggest the Shroud of Turin is probably a religious hoax. As researcher Joe Nickell noted in his book "Relics of the Christ" (The University Press of Kentucky, 2007),the shroud on display in Turin is only one of over 40 such Jesus shrouds — all claimed to be the real one.

281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	3. The Cardiff Giant	1	1	1			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	When farm workers digging a well in Cardiff, N.Y., uncovered a fossilized man in 1869 they found something remarkable. The Cardiff Giant, as the figure became known, was a somewhat realistic figure with roughly human dimensions — except that it was nearly 10 feet tall. It was clearly something unique — but what exactly it was divided the public. Some believed it was a stone carving, but who would have made it so long ago that it was buried so deep in the ground? Others, including a local reverend, were convinced it was proof of the literal truth of Biblical scripture, specifically Genesis 6:4 ("There were giants in the earth in those days" KJV). Here, finally, was one of those Biblical giants, discovered on a rural New York farm! It was in fact a clever hoax by a man named George Hull who had planted the carved stone where it would later be found by the farm hands, partly to prove the Bible literalists wrong.	2	3	2			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	4. Indian Guru Sai Baba's Legerdemain	1	1	1			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	One of the most influential spiritual leaders in India, Satya Sai Baba died last year at the age of 84. For over five decades the charismatic guru enthralled and mystified followers by performing minor miracles, including producing holy ash, watches, statues, necklaces and rings seemingly out of thin air. However, skeptical investigators including Basava Premanand of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations accused Sai Baba of simple magicians' tricks, and pointed out that all the objects were small and easily concealed in his hands and long-sleeved robes. In at least one case Sai Baba was caught on film by British investigator Professor Richard Wiseman secretly pulling small objects from his person while pretending they appeared out of nowhere.	3	3	3			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	5. The Discovery of Noah's Ark	1	1	1			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	Those seeking to find archaeological and historical proof of events in the Bible have often looked for — and, some claim, even found — Noah's Ark. Though many claims of finding the ark are honest mistakes, in 1993 a man hoaxed CBS television into running atwo-hour primetime special titled "The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark." It featured a man named George Jammal, who claimed to have found the ark on a mountain in Turkey. As proof of his incredible claim, he proudly displayed a piece of wood from the ark; it was in fact scrap pine marinated in soy sauce, and Jammal was an actor who had never even been to Turkey.	1	2	2			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	6. The Ossuary of James, Brother of Jesus	1	1	1			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	In 2002 an antiquities dealer in Israel claimed to have discovered a limestone ossuary (used to hold bones of the dead) with an inscription in Aramaic on one side of the box identifying its (missing) contents as those of "James, Son of Joseph, Brother of Jesus." The find made international news because if genuine, it might provide archaeological evidence for Jesus Christ. However many archaeologists were skeptical for several reasons, including that there was no clear provenance (history) for the item and because carved rosette patterns on the other side of the box were rounded from age and decay, while the script on the disputed inscription had sharp edges suggesting it was recently added. A chalk wash also appeared to have been added to the lettering to make it appear older than it actually was. In 2003 the Israeli Antiquities Authority published a report concluding that the inscription was a modern forgery carved on a genuinely old ossuary box. [Faux Real: A Gallery of Forgeries]	2	2	3			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	7. God Speaks to Peter Popoff Via Short-Wave Radio	1	1	1			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	One of the most prominent televangelists in the 1980s was Peter Popoff, who, during his services and revivals, would call out names and home addresses of audience members he'd never met. He even knew personal details such as family members' illnesses or their deceased loved ones' names. It seemed that Popoff got his messages from God or angels, and it greatly impressed his audiences and followers.	2	3	1			
281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	In 1986, magician James "The Amazing" Randi heard about Popoff's amazing abilities and decided to investigate. Randi noticed an apparently minor detail that most people missed: Popoff was wearing a hearing aid or earpiece. Using a radio scanner, Randi discovered that Popoff was actually getting biographical information about audience members from his wife (who had earlier spoken to the audience) using a short-wave radio. The scandal tarnished Popoff's ministry, but he eventually recovered and remains active today.	2	2	3

282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	LOS ANGELES (AP) — "Homeland," which puts the battle against terrorism on American soil, was honored as best drama series at Sunday's Emmys and earned trophies for stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis. "Modern Family" was named best comedy.	2	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"We feel so lucky, lucky not only to have jobs in these challenging times, but to have jobs that we love with people we love," said Steven Levitan, co-creator of "Modern Family."	2	3	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	The drama "Homeland" stopped "Mad Men" in its tracks, denying the show a record-setting fifth trophy and kept Bryan Cranston from his fourth consecutive best drama award for "Breaking Bad" and "Mad Men" star Jon Hamm an also-ran once more.	1	1	2		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	The Emmys refused to play it predictably Sunday, with Jon Cryer of "Two and a Half Men" earning a best actor award and Jimmy Kimmel proving a game but uneven host.	1	2	2		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"I'm one of those pesky Brits, I apologize," said Lewis, who plays an American in the espionage thriller. "I don't really believe in judging art, but I thought I'd show up just in case."	2	1	2		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Danes, eye-catching in a bright yellow dress that gracefully draped the pregnant actress, was effusive.	2	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"My husband, my love, my life, my baby daddy, this doesn't mean anything without you," she said to her spouse, actor Hugh Dancy.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Backstage, Danes said she particularly appreciated one fan: President Barack Obama has said he's a fan of "Homeland," about a Marine and former POW who's suspected of working for al Qaeda.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"No pressure," the actress said. "It's way cool that he is a fan. It speaks to the relevancy of the show and it's hugely validating."	2	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	The acting trophies, along with a best writing award for the show, gave "Homeland" momentum as it headed toward the best drama award.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Aaron Paul won best supporting drama actor for "Breaking Bad" and "Homeland" won the best writing award.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"Thank you so much for not killing me off," Paul said of his drug-dealing character's lucky survival. "Thank you Hollywood for allowing me to be part of your group," he added, noting he'd moved from Idaho to pursue his dreams.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	On the comedy side, Emmy voters decided that "Two and a Half Men" with Jon Cryer and without Charlie Sheen is really good, as Cryer claimed the best comedy actor trophy.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"Don't panic, people. Something has clearly gone terribly wrong. I'm stunned," said Cryer, who on the red carpet before the show has expressed confidence he wouldn't win. Among others, he beat out two-time winner Jim Parsons of "The Big Bang Theory."	2	2	2		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Ashton Kutcher, who joined the show after Sheen was fired, wasn't nominated.	1	1	2		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Julia Louis-Dreyfus was honored as best actress in comedy for "Veep."	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Andy Griffith topped a segment honoring industry members who died during the previous year. Ron Howard, who played Griffith's son Opie in "The Andy Griffith Show," said he belonged "in the pantheon."	2	2	2		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"Dang if he didn't make it look powerful easy while he was going about it," Howard said.	2	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Phyllis Diller, Davy Jones of "The Monkees," Sheman Hemsley and Richard Dawson were among the others honored in a montage.	2	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Earlier in the show, Kimmel dared to mock the in memorian package that typically airs at awards shows with one showing him in various guises. Josh Groban sang a mournful "You're Beautiful" in background.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"I will be missed," Kimmel said.	2	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Maggie Smith was honored as best supporting drama actress for her tart-tongued dowager in "Downton Abbey," unhurt by the program's move from the miniseries category.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"Homeland," the domestic espionage thriller, won the best drama writing award.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"Modern Family" made it look easy as the comedy won the best directing trophy and Eric Stonestreet and Julie Bowen claimed supporting actor awards. There was at least a minor backlash online as some questioned whether the show had a deserving season.	2	2	2		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Stonestreet was funny and touching as he accepted for his role as half of a devoted gay couple.	2	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"I wouldn't be standing here without Jesse Tyler Ferguson, there is no Cam without Mitch," he said, saluting his co-star. "We get the awesome opportunity to play these two characters on TV and show America and the world what a loving couple we can be just like everybody else."	2	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Then he turned saucy: "I never knew I'd be on TV as a gay man, but I love the pictures of hairy chests you guys are sending me, it's really amazing. Thank you for those."	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Among reality competitors, "The Amazing Race" was honored as best reality series, ninth time in 10 nominations for the award. Tom Bergeron of "Dancing With the Stars" won as best host of a reality series.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Julianne Moore's uncanny take on Gov. Sarah Palin in the TV movie "Game Change," about the 2008 presidential campaign, earned her best actress honors.	1	1	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"I feel so validated because Sarah Palin gave me a big thumbs down," Palin said, beaming.	2	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Kevin Costner was named best actor for the history-based miniseries "Hatfields & McCoys," while Tom Berenger was named best supporting actor for the project and Jessica Lange won supporting actress honors for "American Horror Story." ''Game Change" was crownd best series.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" proved unstoppable, winning its 10th consecutive best variety show trophy. Stewart, discussing the lasting value of his show, apparently forgot that what flies on free-wheeling cable gets censored on network television.	2	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"Years from now when the Earth is just a burning husk and aliens visit, they will find a box of these, and they will know, just how predictable these (several bleeps) can be," he said.	1	1	2		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Standup comic Louis C.K. won the Emmy for best comedy writing for "Louie" and for the special "Louis C.K. Live at the Beacon Theatre." Said the comedian after his second win: "Thank you to audiences around the country who still go to see live comedy."	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Kimmel, who played it clean, set up one of the night's best filmed comedy bits by musing on what "Breaking Bad" would have been like had it aired in a G-rated, pre-cable era.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	The answer: a spoof of the opening to "The Andy Griffith Show," with "Breaking Bad" stars Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, fully suited up to cook crystal meth, out at the lake with their fishing poles as the "Andy Griffith" whistling theme song was heard.	2	1	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	As a pungent punchline, they shot dead an unexpected witness: a friendly deputy billed as co-star Don Knotts.	1	1	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	The show started with bathroom humor: A filmed bit with Kathy Bates, Zooey Deschanel and other nominated actresses prepping in the restroom, then discovering a weeping Jimmy Kimmel lamenting a Botox reaction he said would keep him off stage as host.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"You look beautiful," he was reassured. "You look like a 'Real Housewife.'"	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Viewers of the skit may have been puzzled by a nude Lena Dunham, the creator-star of "Girls," who's routinely brave about showing skin on the HBO comedy.	1	1	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Not all his material worked. One bit that fell flat had Kimmel's parents, or so the host said, escorted out of the theater because they promised he would win an Emmy and he didn't.	2	1	2		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"Family Guy" creator Seth MacFarlane found presenting can be tricky.	1	1	2		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"Oh, the mic's over there," he said, after discovering he was on the wrong side of the stage. "This is what happens when you don't come to rehearsal," MacFarlane said.	1	1	2		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Fashionistas noticed yellow was hot, the color of choice for Julianne Moore, a pregnant Danes, Julie Bowen and Hannah Simone from "New Girl."	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	"Best hair and makeup goes to Danes. Perfect!" tweeted Emma Roberts.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	HBO came into the night with a leading 17 creative arts Emmys from a Sept. 15 ceremony honoring technical and other achievements. CBS was second with 13, followed by PBS with 11. Discovery received six awards, NBC got five and ABC and the Cartoon Network won four each. Fox received two trophies.	1	2	1		4	
282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	Emmy has to prove herself a winner with the audience. After rebounding somewhat to 13.5 million viewers in 2010 after an all-time low in 2008 of 12.3 million, last year's show drew 12.4 million viewers airing on Fox. The ceremony rotates annually among the four major networks.	1	2	1		4

285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	HPV vaccine found safe in large study	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A study of nearly 190,000 young women injected with Merck & Co's human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil found no new safety concerns.	1	2	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	Researchers said the only side effects they observed - rare cases of skin infections and fainting - were benign and expected.	2	2	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	"This analysis was very reassuring," said lead researcher Dr. Nicola Klein of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland, California, whose work was funded by Merck.	2	2	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	HPV vaccination is recommended for both boys and girls to shield them from the sexually transmitted infection, which may cause various types of cancer.	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	While Gardasil has already been deemed safe and effective by health regulators across the globe, large follow-up studies are typically required after vaccines hit the market to make sure less-common side effects haven't been missed.	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	Klein's team studied girls and women ages 9 to 26 who had had at least one Gardasil shot between 2006 and 2008.	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	Based on electronic records, they compared ER visits and hospitalizations soon after vaccination and several months later, when short-term side effects would no longer be expected to show up.	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	Three doses of Gardasil, the recommended amount, cost about $360.	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	U.S. health regulators have found no serious side effects apart from soreness at the injection site.	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	At first glance, several health conditions appeared to be linked to the vaccination, including seizures, allergic reactions and birth defects in vaccine recipients.	1	1	2		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	A special safety committee without ties to Merck concluded that most of these conditions were not truly caused by the vaccine, however, but rather unrelated or preexisting conditions detected when the shot was given.	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	"All of a sudden these things get brought up again," said Klein, "but it has absolutely nothing to do with the vaccination."	2	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	After reviewing medical records for a number of different conditions that might be linked to the vaccine, the researchers determined that only two of them were legitimate findings.	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	In the two weeks after getting the vaccine, there were 1.8 cases of skin infections per 10,000 women, compared to just one case per two weeks per 10,000 women months away from the vaccination.	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	And some of those "infections" might simply have been red swellings at the injection site, said Klein, whose findings are published in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine.	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	A STRESS REACTION?				I	4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	On the day of the vaccination, the rate of fainting was six times higher than usual.	1	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	But again, the risk was very low and has been seen before in other vaccine studies, Klein said.	2	2	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	It's possible that fainting may be a stress reaction to the injection itself, according to Dr. Michael Brady, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.	2	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	He said adolescents should sit down for 15 minutes after getting a shot, as also advised by health officials.	2	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	"If they do fall and hit their head it can have consequences, so it's not something to be ignored," added Brady, who was not involved in the new work and has no ties to HPV vaccine makers.	2	1	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	Overall, he said the study didn't bring up any unexpected concerns.	2	2	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	"The combination of a vaccine that is working and is safe should make people feel comfortable," Brady added.	3	2	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	Gardasil is expected to prevent more than 90 percent of genital warts and between 60 and 70 percent of cervical cancers, according to Dr. Christopher Harrison of Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City, Missouri.	2	2	1		4	
285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	"The risk benefit here is clearly and resoundingly in favor of the vaccine being much more beneficial than risky," said Harrison, who was not linked to the new study and has not had any relationship to Merck for the past three years.	2	2	1		4

289	human-rights-activist-arrested-algerian-police-214741851	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — A member of a leading human rights organization has been beaten and arrested in a southern Algerian city.	2	1	3		4	
289	human-rights-activist-arrested-algerian-police-214741851	The lawyer for Yacine Zaid said Tuesday that his client had been punched and beaten by police when they arrested him at a road block in Ouargla , 700 kilometers (435 miles) south of the capital.	3	1	4		4	
289	human-rights-activist-arrested-algerian-police-214741851	The lawyer, Sidhoum Mohamed Amine, said Zaid was arrested Monday on the ground that he had shown a lack of respect for police.	3	1	3		4	
289	human-rights-activist-arrested-algerian-police-214741851	The daily El Watan reported that Zaid would go on trial Monday for "humiliating" and "striking a police officer."	1	1	3		4	
289	human-rights-activist-arrested-algerian-police-214741851	The paper quoted an eyewitness, Abdelmalek Aibek Eg Sahli, a representative of a hotel union, as saying that Zaid "wasn't aggressive and I don't see why he is accused of that."	2	1	2		4

290	human-rights-court-rejects-extradition-appeal-uk-islamist-185154021	PARIS (Reuters) - The European Court of Human Rights on Monday gave final approval for one of Britain's most radical Islamist clerics, Abu Hamza al-Masri, to be extradited to the United States with four others to be tried for terrorism.	1	1	3		4	
290	human-rights-court-rejects-extradition-appeal-uk-islamist-185154021	The Egyptian-born cleric filed an appeal, along with the four other suspects, after the court in Strasbourg authorized Britain to transfer him to the United States on charges that he supported al Qaeda and aided a fatal kidnapping in Yemen.	1	1	3		4	
290	human-rights-court-rejects-extradition-appeal-uk-islamist-185154021	Al-Masri, 54, could face a sentence of over 100 years in an ultra-secure "Supermax" prison, and had argued that such treatment would contravene Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhumane and degrading treatment.	2	1	3		4	
290	human-rights-court-rejects-extradition-appeal-uk-islamist-185154021	"Today the Grand Chamber decided to reject the request.	1	1	2		4	
290	human-rights-court-rejects-extradition-appeal-uk-islamist-185154021	This means that the Chamber judgment of April 10, 2012, is now final," the ECHR said in a statement.	1	1	1		4	
290	human-rights-court-rejects-extradition-appeal-uk-islamist-185154021	The decision also concerned appeals lodged by four other defendants, Babar Ahmad, Syed Tahla Ahsan, Adel Abdul Bary and Khaled Al-Fawwaz, all of whom have been detained in Britain pending extradition to the United States.	1	1	2		4

291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Will Humans Eventually All Look Like Brazilians?	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	It really happened: Six generations of inbreeding spanning the years 1800 to 1960 caused an isolated population of humans living in the hills of Kentucky to become blue-skinned.	2	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	The startlingly blue people, all descendants of a French immigrant named Martin Fugate and still living near his original settlement on the banks of Troublesome Creek when hematologists studied them in the 1960s, turned out to have a rare blood condition called methemoglobinemia.	2	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	A recessive gene was pairing with itself to change the molecular composition of their blood, making it brown as opposed to red, which tinted their skin blue.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	The hematologists' attempt to trace the history of the mutant gene revealed a gnarly Fugate family tree, contorted by many an intermarriage between first cousins, aunts and nephews, and the like over the generations.	2	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Dennis Stacy, whose great-great-grandfather on both his mother's and father's sides was the same person — Henley Fugate — offered a simple explanation for the rampant interbreeding: In the old days in eastern Kentucky, Stacy said, "There was no roads."	2	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	It sounds sordid at worst and lazy at best, but in fact, the Fugates' tale is a miniature version of the story of human coupling since time immemorial.	4	1	2		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Local populations interbreed, causing a sharing of genes, a resulting in-group physical resemblance and, eventually, identification as a distinct race or ethnic group.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	According to Stephen Stearns, a Yale professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, before the invention of the bicycle, the average distance between the birthplaces of spouses in England was 1 mile (1.6 kilometers).	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	During the latter half of the 19th century, bikes upped the distance men went courting to 30 miles (48 km), on average.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Scholars have identified similar patterns in other European countries.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Widespread use of bicycles stimulated the grading and paving of roads, lending credence to the Fugate clan's excuse and making way for the introduction of automobiles.	2	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Love's horizons have kept expanding ever since.	3	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	"The distance between the birthplaces of parents has continued to increase since the invention of the bicycle, making it now easy, if not standard, for parents to have been born on different continents," Stearns told Life's Little Mysteries.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Stearns says globalization, immigration, cultural diffusion and the ease of modern travel will gradually homogenize the human population, averaging out more and more people's traits.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Because recessive traits depend on two copies of the same gene pairing up in order to get expressed, these traits will express themselves more rarely, and dominant traits will become the norm.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	In short, blue skin is out.	3	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Brown skin is in.	3	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Already in the United States, another recessive trait, blue eyes, has grown far less common.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	A 2002 study by the epidemiologists Mark Grant and Diane Lauderdale found that only 1 in 6 non-Hispanic white Americans has blue eyes, down from more than half of the U.S. white population being blue-eyed just 100 years ago.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	[One Common Ancestor Behind Blue Eyes]				I   	4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	"The only explanation for the observed pattern that was consistent with the data (that we could think of) was that assortative mating had changed," Lauderdale told Life's Little Mysteries.	2	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Assortative mating is the tendency of people to mate with members of their same ancestral group — a tendency that has seemingly lessened over time.	2	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	"This was consistent with a birth year-related increase in the proportions of individuals who listed more than one ancestry in the 1980 census."	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Lauderdale says blue eyes won't die out completely; they'll simply stabilize at a low level that reflects the chance of mating between two individuals possessing recessive blue-eye genes.	2	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Other recessive traits will drop to low levels too, according to University of Delaware evolutionary biologist John McDonald.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	"Because most immigrants to the U.S. are from Asia, Africa or Latin America, any trait that is more common in northern Europeans than in the rest of the world will get less common over the near future in the U.S. due to immigration," McDonald wrote in an email.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	"Examples would include red and blond hair, blue eyes, and freckles.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Traits that are recessive and are more common in some groups than others will decrease due to blending; blue eyes, sickle cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis are examples of this."	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	Meanwhile, many other physical traits will simply blend together.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	"Most of the traits that we think of as distinguishing different groups (hair color, skin color, hair curliness, facial features, eye shape) are controlled by multiple genes, so they don't follow a simple dominant/recessive pattern," McDonald explained.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	"In those cases, blending will make people look more similar over time."	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	It's not straightforward to predict how blending of genes affects physical appearances, but McDonald said the tendency is for such traits to average out.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	The average American skin and hair color will probably darken slightly, and there will be fewer people with very dark or very pale skin and hair.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	The genetic mixing under way in the United States is also happening to a greater or lesser degree in other parts of the world, the researchers said.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	In some places, unique physical traits tailored to the habitat still confer an evolutionary advantage and thus might not bow out so easily; in other places, immigration happens much more slowly than it does elsewhere.	1	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	According to Stearns, perfect homogenization of the human race will probably never occur, but in general, Earth is becoming more and more of a melting pot.	2	1	1		4	
291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	A population forged from the long-term mixing of Africans, Native Americans and Europeans serves as an archetype for the future of humanity, Stearns said: A few centuries from now, we're all going to look like Brazilians.	2	1	1		4

292	humble-business-card-gets-superpowers-nfc-exclusive-083146024	Apple may have skipped near-field communication in the iPhone 5, but that hasn't stopped everyone else from getting on board the NFC train. The latest passenger: Moo.com, which just started experimenting with NFC business cards, with a planned rollout in 2013.	2	1	1		4	
292	humble-business-card-gets-superpowers-nfc-exclusive-083146024	[More from Mashable: Should You Wait for the iPhone 5?]				I	4	
292	humble-business-card-gets-superpowers-nfc-exclusive-083146024	You may remember Moo as the folks who brought us Facebook business cards earlier this year. Now they're giving the whole experience of exchanging contact information a needed upgrade with short-range NFC tech.	1	2	1		4	
292	humble-business-card-gets-superpowers-nfc-exclusive-083146024	It works like this: You order NFC cards from Moo, specifying what you want the NFC tag to do. It could just contain contact information, but it can also include actions like presenting a video, or an app download, or your latest tweets. When you hand someone your card, and they tap it with an NFC-enabled smartphone, the preprogrammed magic happens. (Check out an explainer video below.)	1	2	1		4	
292	humble-business-card-gets-superpowers-nfc-exclusive-083146024	[More from Mashable: Apple May Not Include NFC in the iPhone 5 [VIDEO]]				I	4	
292	humble-business-card-gets-superpowers-nfc-exclusive-083146024	The process isn't without its limitations. First, obviously the person will need an NFC phone. While many popular Android phones have it (and so do the coming crop of Windows Phones, if anyone cares), Apple is out.	3	1	2		4	
292	humble-business-card-gets-superpowers-nfc-exclusive-083146024	Second, the cards will likely be a lot more expensive than conventional cards. Moo hasn't revealed pricing, but it's telling that they're only giving current customers who place a business card order a single NFC card. Moo calls it an "open beta test," and the NFC chip will include an electronic version of the card's contact info.	1	2	2		4	
292	humble-business-card-gets-superpowers-nfc-exclusive-083146024	However, the cards come with a big bonus, too: Customers will be able to reprogram the NFC chip within to customize cards for various customers. A global manager might want to change the material presented depending on what part of the world he's in, or, if you have the cards for a while, you'll probably want to change the projects you present to new clients. Or you could just have fun with it and show a different random YouTube video on each card.	1	2	1		4	
292	humble-business-card-gets-superpowers-nfc-exclusive-083146024	While the cost is still a question mark -- a big one -- we like the idea of flashing custom content to people with our cards. Of course, we stopped the silly practice of writing down phone numbers and emails years ago with the dawn of apps like CardMunch. NFC is progress, as long as the price stays under control.	2	3	2		4

293	hundreds-protest-anti-islam-film-nigeria-121502291	The march took place Monday in the city of Kaduna, where hundreds were killed in religious violence following Nigeria's 2011 presidential election.	1	1	3		4	
293	hundreds-protest-anti-islam-film-nigeria-121502291	Those protesting left behind graffiti on walls reading: "Death to the Americans, Death to the Israelites."	1	1	3		4	
293	hundreds-protest-anti-islam-film-nigeria-121502291	The protest comes after a series of protests have taken place in Nigeria, a nation largely split between a Christian south and a Muslim north.	1	1	1		4

294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A woman who was about to be released from an Idaho prison will stay behind bars a while longer because federal prosecutors say she mailed a threatening stick figure drawing to a relative.	2	1	2		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	Linda Joyce Lakes was serving time at the Pocatello Women's Correctional Center on probation violations stemming from a 2007 grand theft sentence, and she was scheduled to be released last Friday.	1	1	2		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	But earlier this month, the U.S. attorney's office charged her with mailing threatening communications, a felony.	1	1	2		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	Prosecutors say that in 2010, Lakes mailed a drawing that apparently depicted a battered stick figure alongside threatening phrases such as "No tears," ''No hiding," and "No more you."	2	1	2		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	Kyle Wright, an FBI agent in Pocatello who investigated the case, described the drawing in a court document.	1	1	1		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	"One stick figure appeared to be lying down with his face smashed.	2	1	2		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	The baseball bat was lying nearby with damage that appeared to be consistent with its use on the first stick figure.	2	1	2		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	The second stick figure appeared to be walking away with a smile," Wright wrote.	2	1	1		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	Wright also said in his affidavit that Lakes sent a letter with the drawing that indicated her prison sentence was coming to an end and that the recipient should be prepared for his final moments.	1	1	1		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	The FBI agent also said that Lakes told the FBI her drawing symbolized her hate for a man who had abused her in the past, and that one day she wanted to beat and possibly kill him.	2	1	3		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	Lakes was released from the state prison and taken into federal custody.	1	1	1		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	She waived her preliminary hearing on the charge and has not yet entered a plea.	1	1	1		4	
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	Lisa Tolle, a paralegal with Federal Defender Services of Idaho in Pocatello, said her office had just been assigned the case and attorneys had not yet fully reviewed it.	2	1	1		4

295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has proposed tougher rules on assessing the safety and monitoring the use of medical devices and implants, after weak EU regulations were partly blamed for a global scandal over French-made breast implants.	1	1	3		4	
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	Investigations last year showed that hundreds of thousands of women around the world had been implanted with substandard silicone implants made by defunct French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP), which safety regulators had failed to stop for more than a decade.	2	1	2		4	
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	The scandal prompted calls for Europe to toughen its controls on medical devices, which are currently overseen by an ad hoc network of up to 80 national assessment agencies, most of which are private companies.	2	1	1		4	
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	"Just a few months ago, everybody was shocked by the scandal involving fraudulent breast implants which affected tens of thousands of women in Europe and around the world," EU health commissioner John Dalli said in a statement on Wednesday to outline the draft rules.	3	1	3		4	
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	The proposals take into account lessons from the PIP implant scandal, and will significantly tighten the authorization process for medical devices before they are put on the market, the European Commission said.	2	1	2		4	
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	Among the main changes will be an extension of the current legal definition of medical devices to include breast and other aesthetic implants.	1	1	1		4	
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	Independent assessment agencies will be given greater powers to monitor device manufacturers, including unannounced factory inspections and regular product testing, while EU governments will be obliged to improve their supervision of the agencies.	1	2	1		4	
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	"If this was happening in the market, the PIP scandal would have been detected many years before and eliminated," Dalli told a news conference.	2	1	2		4	
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	Better product traceability systems will also be introduced so that people can be alerted more rapidly to safety concerns surrounding a particular device.	1	2	2		4	
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	The European market for medical devices was estimated at 95 billion euros ($123 billion) in 2009, with products ranging from sticking plasters to high-tech miniature diagnostic implants and life support machines.	2	1	1		4	
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	Major manufacturers of medical devices include Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Abbott Laboratories, Allergan and Smith & Nephew.	1	1	1		4	
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	The legislation must be jointly approved by EU governments and lawmakers, which could take up to two years.	2	1	1		4

297	individual-shows-boldly-stamp-paris-fashion-week-194057909	Westwood cited Sergei Diaghilev's "Ballets Russes" — the early 20th century's most famous ballet company — as a key inspiration.	1	2	1		3	
297	individual-shows-boldly-stamp-paris-fashion-week-194057909	The influential troupe used exotic styles with billowing trousers and turbans — which was evoked in many of the baggy globe-trotting looks.	3	3	1		3

297	individual-shows-boldly-stamp-paris-fashion-week-194057909	"We were in a reflective mood..." said Viktor Horsting, one half of the famed Dutch design duo which is approaching its 20th anniversary.	1	2	1		3	
297	individual-shows-boldly-stamp-paris-fashion-week-194057909	Not ones to normally take things quite so literally, the inseparable Viktor and Rolf channeled mirrors in their oversized spring-summer ode to 70's pleated glamor.	2	2	1		3	
297	individual-shows-boldly-stamp-paris-fashion-week-194057909	The designers, who founded their Amsterdam-based fashion house in 1993, sent models through a reflective tunnel onto a catwalk wearing mainly black, white and silver ensembles that featured blinding mirror appliques on sumptuous silks.	1	2	1		3

297	individual-shows-boldly-stamp-paris-fashion-week-194057909	Giant bows in soft pink and purple were used high or low on the waist to sumptuous effect.	3	2	1		3	
297	individual-shows-boldly-stamp-paris-fashion-week-194057909	But there were some small misses in proportion, too: One tubular floor-length skirt had rose-shaped mirror appliques whose size competed with the model's head.	4	1	2		3

297	individual-shows-boldly-stamp-paris-fashion-week-194057909	This spring-summer 2013 collection was also a celebration of the natural world in its careful palette the Cerulean blue of sky, orange of sea coral and tea green.	3	3	1		3	
297	individual-shows-boldly-stamp-paris-fashion-week-194057909	But perhaps nature is in the house DNA: After all, designer Jean Bousquet who founded the house in 1962, named it after a small, beautifully striped dabbling duck with the same name.	4	2	1		3

298	indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance	For decades explorers have enjoyed a place on the cutting edge of the country's mining boom as they scoured the earth for fresh mineral deposits, a process that can take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars before payback.	2	3	2		4	
298	indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance	But now they complain that new rules aimed at boosting state revenue from natural resources have slashed investment in mineral prospecting and could threaten the entire $93 billion sector.	2	1	3		4	
298	indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance	"Exploration is by nature optimistic," said Wesser, 73, an Indonesian, born to Dutch parents, with decades of mining experience.	2	2	1		4	
298	indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance	"The government doesn't understand the importance of exploration ... Mining without exploration is an industry that goes downhill."	3	1	2		4	
298	indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance	The explorers are not the only ones struggling with the impact of the regulations that have caused industry-wide uncertainty in Indonesia, compounding the effects of a global commodities downturn.	2	1	3		4	
298	indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance	Small miners in particular have been hit, leading to mine closures and lay-offs in regions such as Sulawesi island, with some resorting to bribing central government officials to continue to export, according to interviews with four mining executives.	2	1	3		4	
298	indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance	An analysis of official data shows the rules have also caused a slump in exports of ore, leading key buyer China to seek supplies from elsewhere.	2	1	2		4

298	indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance	The regulations restrict the export of raw ores, force foreign miners to divest over half their assets after 10 years of production and require domestic processing of ore by 2014.	1	1	2		4

298	indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance	The most dramatic effect of the new rules has been on mineral exports, which surged as companies fought to beat a May 6 export tax deadline and plunged thereafter.	2	2	2		4

298	indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance	Nowhere is the human impact of the slide more visible than in the remote mining communities of Sulawesi, an island east of Borneo and the country's main source of nickel.	2	1	2		4

300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	PRESIDENT OBAMA SUMMONED the top four congressional leaders to the White House on Saturday morning, July 23, 2011.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The night before, House Speaker John A. Boehner had withdrawn from negotiations to raise the $14 trillion federal debt limit and save the government from a catastrophic default.	2	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"Nobody wanted to be there," Boehner later recalled.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"The president's still pissed."	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	They had about 10 days left before the government would run out of money.	1	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Given the global importance of U.S. Treasury securities, failing to extend the debt limit could trigger a worldwide economic meltdown.	2	1	4		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Boehner said he believed that he and the others — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi — had a plan.	3	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	He told Obama: We think we can work this out.	3	3	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Give us a little more time.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	We'll come back to you.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	We are not going to negotiate this with you.	2	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Obama objected, saying that he couldn't be left out of the process.	2	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"I've got to sign this bill."	2	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Reid, the most powerful Democrat on Capitol Hill, spoke up.	3	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The congressional leaders want to speak privately, he said.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Give us some time.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	This was it.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Congress was taking over.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The leaders were asking the president to leave the meeting he had called.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Before the meeting, without telling Obama, the four leaders had tentatively agreed on the framework of a deal.	2	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The congressional plan guaranteed that the debt limit would have to be revisited during the 2012 presidential campaign, and Obama was insisting that any agreement would have to take the country through the election.	2	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Around 10 p.m., Obama called Boehner, who was at dinner with friends.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	I am not going to sign a bill that requires me to deal with the debt ceiling a second time before the election, the president told him.	2	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	He was furious.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"Listen," Boehner said he told Obama.	3	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"I understand it....But you're not going to have a choice.	3	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	We've got an agreement."	3	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Obama again said he would veto such a bill.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	We're too close to default to reopen the talks, Boehner said.	3	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Congress is going to move forward on its own.	2	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The president told his senior staff that the call with Boehner had led nowhere.	3	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"So we've got to figure out Plan B. Which is, how do we get out of this thing?" he said.	3	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The problem was that they did not have a Plan B.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	IT WAS INCREASINGLY clear that no one was running Washington.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	That was trouble for everyone, but especially for Obama.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Although running things is a joint venture between the president and Congress, a president has to dominate Congress — or at least be seen as dominating Congress.	3	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The last president to fold was George H.W. Bush, who gave in to Democrats' demands that income taxes be raised in a 1990 budget deal.	1	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	And Bush had been a one-term president.	1	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Obama sent word that he wanted the two Democratic leaders at the White House at 6 p.m. that Sunday, July 24.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	No reason was given.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Reid arrived in the Oval Office with his chief of staff, David Krone.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"Harry," the president began, "I hear you have kind of an outline, a framework of something."	3	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Reid began to lay out the two-step, $2.7 trillion debt limit extension, then stopped.	2	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	He was not a details guy.	2	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"Well, let David just tell you what it is," he said.	3	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	It was highly unusual for someone to pass the ball so completely to a staffer.	2	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The 44-year-old Krone outlined the plan, including a secret Republican pledge to count $1 trillion in savings from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan toward deficit reduction.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	That was surprising.	2	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Earlier, Boehner had not been willing to accept this accounting gimmick.	2	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"I don't trust these guys," the president said dismissively.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Krone either would not or could not conceal his anger.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"Wait a second," Obama said, interrupting someone else who was about to speak.	3	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"I can tell David has something else to say."	3	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"Mr.				S	4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	President, I am sorry — with all due respect — that we are in this situation that we're in, but we got handed this football on Friday night.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	And I didn't create this situation.	3	2	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The first thing that baffles me is, from my private-sector experience, the first rule that I've always been taught is to have a Plan B. And it is really disheartening that you, that this White House did not have a Plan B."	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Several jaws dropped as the Hill staffer blasted the president to his face.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"So I don't have a lot of options, in the past 36, 48 hours, to put together," Krone continued.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"We're supposed to be the ones that fend off an economic catastrophe.	3	1	4		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	And what we find ourselves is now, with no deal, we're going to have to root for the worst possible things to happen in order to prove to the Republicans that you cannot be so callous and let the debt limit expire.	3	1	4		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"That is a horrible position that we're in," Krone said.	3	1	4		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"And so this may not be the perfect deal, but it's the only deal that we have on the table right now in the situation that we find ourselves."	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Obama replied: "I understand what you think you're doing.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	I'm not doing that.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The one thing that we need to bring stability to this economy is not throwing the debt limit increase back into the political arena.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	I'm not doing that under any circumstances.	2	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	So if that means that I'm not signing this bill, I'm not signing the bill."	2	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	After the meeting, Obama made a beeline for Krone.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The others stepped back so the two could talk, but they still overheard the president's words.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"I'm sorry," Obama said, putting an arm around Krone's shoulder.	3	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"You didn't deserve that.	3	3	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	I know how hard you're working, and I know we wouldn't even have a chance without you."	3	3	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Reid gave Krone a ride back to the Capitol.	1	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The majority leader was almost like a father to him.	2	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"You stood up to him," Reid said.	3	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"He needed to hear it, and nobody was telling him."	3	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Asked later about the meeting with Reid and Krone, Obama said, "What I said to them is, essentially, any short-term deal is not going to be acceptable.	3	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	We can go back to the drawing board, but we're running out of time.	3	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	They need to understand we're not going to do a short-term deal."	3	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	After more pressure from Obama, Reid split from the other congressional leaders.	2	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Later that night, he released a $2.7 trillion deficit reduction plan with a single-step debt limit increase that would last through 2012.	2	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Five days later, on Friday, July 29, by a narrow margin of 218 to 210, the House passed Boehner's version of the proposal.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	It included the two-step procedure that the president adamantly opposed.	2	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	IN THE WHITE House at 10 later that night, Obama's key advisers discussed the House vote in the office of William Daley, the White House chief of staff.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	There was a chance the Senate Democrats would fold, because the fastest solution would be to pass the House bill and get out of town for their summer recess.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	If the bill managed to gain Senate approval, would the president really veto it?	2	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"You can't veto," Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told the group.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"You cannot be responsible for default."	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Anything had to be done to prevent it.	3	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Anything to preserve the global economy.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"If he caves," said David Plouffe, Obama's senior political adviser, "it will have long-lasting political repercussions that we may never get out of.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	If we draw a line in the sand on something this important and cross it, we may never be able to come back."	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Geithner had to deal with the possibility that the House bill could reach Obama's desk.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"My recommendation to the president would be, we've got to sign this.	3	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	If that's what they offer us, we sign it."	3	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Obama appeared unexpectedly at the door.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"What's going on?	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	What are you guys talking about?"	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	He knew, of course.	3	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	They quickly recapped.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Could I actually veto it?	2	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Obama asked, adopting his law professor manner.	2	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	What would happen on the day of the veto?	2	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The day after?	2	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"It would have massive effects," Geithner said.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Treasury had to conduct a bond auction in the open market in about five days, the regular Tuesday auction, with settlement on Thursday.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	That first auction could be a kind of tripwire, setting off a chain reaction.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The federal government couldn't pay its bills.	3	1	4		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"Why would anyone buy U.S. bonds if it's an open question whether we are going to have the authority to pay for them?"	3	1	4		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Another possible outcome, Geithner said, was perhaps worse.	3	1	4		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"Suppose we have an auction and no one shows up?"	3	1	4		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The cascading impact would be unknowable.	3	1	5		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The world could decide to dump U.S. Treasuries.	3	1	5		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Prices would plummet, interest rates would skyrocket.	3	1	5		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The one pillar of stability, the United States, the rock in the global economy, could collapse.	3	1	5		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"So," the president said, "if we give $1.2 trillion now in spending cuts" — the amount in the House bill to get the first increase in the debt ceiling for about six to nine months — "what happens next time?"	3	2	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The Republicans would then come back next year, in the middle of the presidential campaign, and impose more conditions on the next debt ceiling increase.	3	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	He could not give the Republicans that kind of weapon.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	It was hostage taking.	3	1	4		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	It was blackmail.	3	1	4		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	So, Obama said, they had to break the Republicans on this.	3	1	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Otherwise, they would be back whenever it suited them politically.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	They were out of options, Geithner said.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The only one might be accepting the House bill, loathsome as it might be.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	"The 2008 financial crisis will be seen as a minor blip if we default," he said.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The president said, "The Republicans are forcing the risk of a default on us.	3	1	4		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	I can't stop them from doing that.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	We can have the fight now, or we can have the fight later on, but the fight is coming to us."	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	So, no, Obama said, he was not going to cave.	3	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Period.	2	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	He said good night, got up, and left.	1	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	He was very agitated.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Geithner thought there was one other consideration.	3	1	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	He did not mention it to anyone, not even the president, but he had thought about it a great deal.	3	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	It was not just that Obama faced an economic choice or a political choice.	3	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	He faced a moral choice.	3	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The president should not put himself in the position of saying unequivocally that he would veto, Geithner concluded, for one simple reason: No one could be sure how to put the American or the global economy back together again.	3	1	3		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The impact would be calamitous.	3	1	5		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	Obama n ever had to confront the veto question.	3	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	A few days later, House Republicans dropped their insistence on the two-step plan.	2	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The final plan accepted a debt limit increase that would take the country through the 2012 presidential contest.	2	2	1		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	It also postponed $2.4 trillion in spending cuts until early 2013.	2	2	2		4	
300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	The long-term deficit crisis had not been solved, but merely put off, leaving the United States at the edge of the fiscal cliff, where it remains today.	3	1	3		4

301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	Gandhi has no official government post, but as Congress party president and torchbearer of India's widely revered first family, she has the last word on big policy issues: and for her, social welfare has always come before liberalizing the economy.	3	3	2		4

301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	However, insiders say Gandhi remains instinctively wary of economic liberalization and trimming the budget deficit.	3	2	2		4

301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	In one letter, she closed by urging a minister: "You may like to have the matter examined appropriately".	3	2	1		4

301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	How was Gandhi persuaded that, as one government official put it, "if you are not growing you are distributing poverty"?	2	1	2		4	
301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	For one thing, the economy was in trouble.	2	1	2		4	
301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	Growth had dropped to its lowest clip in three years, the fiscal deficit was blowing past official targets, and the government was under heavy fire for sitting on its hands as the crisis mounted.	2	1	4		4	
301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	With Mukherjee gone from the Finance Ministry, Singh and Chidambaram made their move, warning Gandhi of a possible slump in the rupee and even a repeat of 1991, sources said.	3	1	2		4	
301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	"There were three meetings over about four weeks ... to tell her that if we don't do all this it will be bad politics," said the senior government official.	3	1	3		4	
301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	Singh also tackled Gandhi at length on the issue in July during a flight from Delhi to the northeastern state of Assam.	2	2	2		4	
301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	Adding his voice at a separate meeting, Commerce Minister Anand Sharma explained to Gandhi that opening up to global supermarkets like Wal-Mart Stores Inc could tame the corruption that plagues the state-run food distribution network - a compelling argument after two years of graft scandals that have damaged her government.	3	2	4		4	
301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	When Gandhi returned in September from a medical check-up abroad, the stage was set for 'big bang Friday'.	2	1	2		4	
301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	And although the reforms triggered the walkout of a key coalition partner from the government, reducing it to a minority, she has resisted calls for a U-turn and even plans to join a street march in favor of the retail sector reform.	2	2	2		4	
301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	Gandhi's ambition in all this is to ensure that the Congress party returns to power in 2014, with her son - Rahul - at the helm of the government after eight years waiting in the wings.	2	2	1		4	
301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	"What she is concentrating on is really the need to be re-elected," said M.J. Akbar, a former Congress party lawmaker and once a trusted Gandhi family insider.	3	1	2		4

302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	Instagram passed Twitter in daily active users on mobile in August for the first time, according to new comScore data provided to Mashable.	1	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	Instagram had 7.3 million daily mobile users for the month, while Twitter had 6.9 million.	1	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	In fact, comScore's data shows that Instagram's daily active user count has almost increased tenfold in the six-month period starting in March, when it had 886,000 daily active visitors.	1	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	Twitter's mobile user numbers have increased as well, but at a much slower rate.	1	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	Part of this may simply be due to the fact that Instagram is a younger company, but it's impressive nonetheless.	3	1	1		4

302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	Twitter did end up having more total unique visitors in August than Instagram overall (29 million vs. 21 million, respectively), but fewer of them returned on a daily basis, and Twitter's visitors spent less time on average viewing content than visitors to Instagram.	1	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	Each of Instagram's mobile users spent an average of 257 minutes on the app (or more than four hours), while Twitter's users spent an average of 169.9 minutes from mobile (or a little less than three hours.)	1	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	The data comes from comScore's Mobile Metrix 2.0 tool, which uses survey data and on-device metering to provide a more comprehensive estimate of mobile usage for various websites and apps.	1	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	The data factors in visits to the apps and websites for Instagram and Twitter from iOS, Android and BlackBerry mobile devices.	1	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	However, it obviously doesn't take into account the number of active users who visit a website from a non-mobile device, which would certainly tilt in favor of Twitter.	3	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	Facebook acquired Instagram for around $735 million earlier this year (the deal was initially worth more than $1 billion, but the value declined with Facebook's stock.)	1	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	In an S-1 filing earlier this year, Zuckerberg explained that part of the reason he wanted Instagram was to "enable users to increase their levels of mobile engagement and photo sharing."	2	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	The latest comScore numbers clearly show that Instagram has figured out mobile engagement.	1	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	Now the question is: When will Facebook capitalize on this by finding ways to monetize Instagram?	1	1	1		4	
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	Twitter may have fallen behind Instagram in daily active users, but the social network already has an advertising model in place that is expected to help it earn more in mobile ad revenue this year than Facebook.	2	1	1		4

306	iran-accuses-iaea-passing-nuclear-secrets-israel-161201740--sector	DUBAI (Reuters) - A senior Iranian lawmaker accused the UN nuclear watchdog on Sunday of passing confidential details of Iran's atomic work to Israel, and a military commander said Tehran may consider a pre-emptive strike on the Jewish state if it looked set to attack.				i	3	
306	iran-accuses-iaea-passing-nuclear-secrets-israel-161201740--sector	Javad Jahangirzadeh, a member of parliament's presiding board, said International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano had made "repeated trips" to Israel, divulging sensitive information about what Tehran says is its peaceful nuclear program.	1	1	1		3

308	iranian-news-agency-picks-onion-article-fact-170925534	An Iranian news agency has picked up as fact a story from the paper about a supposed survey showing a majority of white Americans would rather vote for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (ah-muh-DEE'-neh-zhahd) than President Barack Obama.	1	1	1			
308	iranian-news-agency-picks-onion-article-fact-170925534	The only trouble is it was made up, like everything in the just-for-laughs newspaper, which is headquartered in the comedic capital Chicago.	2	1	1

310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	BEIRUT (AP) — Iraq has banned a North Korean plane from its airspace on suspicion it was carrying weapons for Syria, a government spokesman said Friday, potentially closing a supply line for President Bashar Assad's embattled regime.	1	3	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	U.S. officials have accused Baghdad of allowing Iran to fly weapons to Syrian forces through Iraqi airspace, a charge Iraq has denied. North Korea and Iran are allies of Assad whose military is fighting a civil war against rebels trying to topple him.	1	1	4			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	In remarks published Friday, Assad was adamant that the rebels "will not succeed" and said a foreign military intervention such as the one that helped topple Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi will "not be repeated" in Syria.	2	2	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Assad's comments come at a time of bloody stalemate, with neither side able to deliver a knock-out blow. Activists on Friday raised the number of people killed in the 18-month conflict to nearly 30,000. Daily death tolls have been rising in recent weeks, with the regime attacking from the air and some rebels using heavy weapons.	3	1	5			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Both sides have foreign backers. Assad's allies include Russia and China, along with Iran and North Korea, while the rebels are supported by the U.S. and Western allies, Turkey and several Gulf states, such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia.	1	1	1			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department identified 117 Iranian aircraft it said were ferrying weapons to the Syrian regime. The department said the planes were delivering weapons and Iranian forces under the cover of "humanitarian" shipments.	1	1	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Iraq has accepted Iranian assurances that it is not using Iraqi airspace to smuggle weapons into Syria, the Obama administration's choice for ambassador to Iraq, R. Stephen Beecroft, said earlier this week. He said the U.S. is pressing the Iraqi government, whose Shiite-led coalition has close ties with Iran, to force flights to land and be inspected.	1	2	1			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Iraq has denied it is turning a blind eye to suspected Iranian weapons shipments, but on Thursday banned a North Korean plane from using its airspace. The government rejected the request from Pyongyang to fly a plane to Syria through Iraqi skies, on suspicion it carried weapons, government spokesman Ali al-Moussawi confirmed Friday.	2	2	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, an ally of Iran, has denied repeatedly that he is allowing weapons trafficking and has said Baghdad will remain neutral in the Syria conflict.	1	2	2			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	The issue has been a sore point between Baghdad and Washington. It was raised again in a phone call Friday between al-Maliki and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden. The vice president spoke of the need "to prevent any state from taking advantage of Iraq's territory or air space to send weapons to Syria," the White House said.	3	1	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Iraq's decision to ban the North Korean plane may signal Baghdad's attempts to repair weakening relations with the United States.	1	2	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	In Damascus, meanwhile, Assad lashed out at Gulf countries, which he accused of using their enormous oil wealth to try to drive him from power. He singled out Saudi Arabia and Qatar, among his most vocal critics.	1	1	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	"They think their money can buy geography, history and a regional role," Assad was quoted as saying in the Egyptian weekly Al-Ahram Al-Arabi.	3	1	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	"They are giving terrorists weapons and money with hope of repeating the Libyan model," Assad added. "Instead of helping regional stability, they are supplying armed elements with weapons and training in order to weaken the Syrian state."	3	1	4			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	The upheaval in Syria presents an opportunity for the Gulf's Sunni rulers to bolster their influence and possibly leave Shiite powerhouse Iran without its critical alliances that flow through Damascus. Assad's regime is led by the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.	1	2	1			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Syria's ties with the Gulf nations have been strained in the past — Assad once called Saudi King Abdullah and other Arab leaders "half men" for being critical of Hezbollah over the 34-day war between the Lebanese Shiite militant group and Israel in 2006.	2	1	2			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	After Assad's remarks were published, Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoebi told state-run TV that the president had received nine Egyptian journalists and had a chat with them about the latest developments.	1	1	1			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	The minister said none of the journalists took notes as the meeting was considered a "personal visit," but a reporter for Al-Ahram Al-Arabi published some of what was said.	1	1	1			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	In the meeting with the Egyptian journalists, Assad was also quoted as saying that the only way to solve the Syrian crisis is through "dialogue with the opposition" and that the "door for dialogue is open."	1	3	1			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Most Syrian opposition groups reject any talks with the regime, saying they will not accept anything less than Assad's departure from power and the dissolving of his regime's security agencies.	1	1	2			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	One of the opposition groups, the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change in Syria, on Friday accused the regime of being behind the disappearance of two of its leaders.	1	1	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Abdul-Aziz al-Kheir and Ayas Ayyash were expected to take part in a conference Sunday in Damascus by some 20 Syrian groups that are calling for Assad to step down. But they disappeared Thursday along with a friend who had picked them up at Damascus International Airport, the group said.	1	1	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	The group's head, Hassan Abdul-Azim, said the regime was believed to be behind the disappearance. Openly disparaging the regime has always been taboo and fraught with danger in Syria, although some have grown emboldened because of the uprising.	2	2	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Abdul-Azim said the opposition wants a "new regime that represents the will of the people." He said his group will go ahead with the conference. The gathering will invite European ambassadors and envoys from China and Russia.	1	2	1			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Also Friday, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nearly 30,000 Syrians have been killed during the conflict.	1	1	4			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	The Observatory's count includes 20,935 civilians; 1,153 army defectors fighting alongside the rebels; and 7,141 Syrian troops fighting for the Assad regime — which gives a total of 29,229, said the head of the group, Rami Abdul-Rahman.	1	1	2			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	The list is compiled from reports by witnesses and medical staff, he said, adding that he only includes those identified by name or whose death was authenticated by amateur video. The Syrian military rarely releases figures on troops killed.	1	1	3			
310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	Another Syrian opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees, put the overall death toll at 26,405. However, its count does not include Syrian troops killed in battle. The LCC relies on a network of activists in Syria to collect its information.	1	1	4

311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	DUBAI (Reuters) - Iraq will ask Syria-bound Iranian planes passing through its airspace to land for random inspections after Washington said they could be ferrying arms to Damascus, the Iraqi foreign minister said in an interview.	3	1	3		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	U.S. officials had raised their concerns over the past few days on the sidelines of United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York, Hoshiyar Zebari told the London-based al-Hayat newspaper.	2	1	2		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	"We have informed Mrs Clinton (U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton) and U.S. officials that the government plans to bring planes down and conduct random inspections," Zebari said in the interview published on Sunday.	3	1	3		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	He confirmed he was referring to Iranian planes.	2	1	2		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	Washington had already said it was asking Iraq about Iranian flights suspected of carrying arms to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a staunch Iranian ally fighting an 18-month-old revolt against his rule.	2	1	3		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	Iraq has said it would never allow any arms to pass through its airspace to either side in the conflict.	2	1	2		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	The government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shi'ite Muslim, is close to regional Shi'ite power Iran.	1	1	2		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	Iran is one of the main allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who follows an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam.	1	1	3		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	Maliki has opposed demands by Sunni Muslim Arab Gulf nations that Assad step down to end the escalating crisis.	2	1	2		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	Zebari said the U.S. officials had said any flights carrying weapons to Syrian would break U.N. Security Council resolutions, and demanded Iraq stop them.	2	1	3		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	Washington had provided no specific intelligence of such flights, he added.	2	1	1		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	Iranian flights over Iraq had begun in March and stopped after Iraq asked that they be halted, the minister told the newspaper.	2	2	2		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	"They resumed again towards the end of July and they said these flights contain no weapons or hardware, and that they transport pilgrims, visitors and so on.	2	2	2		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	But to verify their shipments, we will ask these planes to land," he said.	2	2	2		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	Zebari said Iraq opposed any foreign intervention in Syria and favored a negotiated solution that would ensure a peaceful transition in Syria, starting with an immediate ceasefire.	2	3	2		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	He added Iraq had proposed holding another meeting of world powers on Syria as a follow up to the talks held in Geneva in June.	2	2	1		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	"What we have proposed to (Russian Foreign Minister Sergei) Lavrov is perhaps there is a need to convene a 'Geneva 2' to activate mechanisms for implementing what has been agreed upon and not to reopen the discussions," he said.	3	3	1		4	
311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	The Geneva meeting agreed a transitional government should be set up in Syria, but the major powers were at odds over what part Assad might play in the process.	2	2	2		4

314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli leaders made no comment on Tuesday over the latest outburst from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, maintaining near-total silence as the country closed down for the holiest Jewish day of the year, Yom Kippur.	2	1	2		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	The Day or Atonement runs from Tuesday afternoon through to dusk on Wednesday, meaning there was no comment either on U.S. President Barack Obama's address to the United Nations.	1	1	1		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	Speaking in New York, Ahmadinejad said on Monday Israel had no roots in the Middle East and would be "eliminated".	1	1	3		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	It was the latest piece of fiery rhetoric from the Iranian leader, who has regularly riled Israel and fueled concern that if the Islamic Republic one day obtained nuclear weapons it might turn them on the Jewish State.	3	1	3		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	Israel's ambassador to the United Nations denounced the comments but ministers and officials in Israel were silent.	1	1	1		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	There was also little mention of his words in the Israeli press on Tuesday, which was focused instead on domestic politics.	1	1	1		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior advisers, speaking in private, have shrugged off Ahmadinejad's statements in the past, saying he did not have a policy-making role when it came to Iran's disputed nuclear program.	1	1	2		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	Instead, they scrutinize the utterances of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who, they say, is the person responsible for crucial decision-making.	1	1	2		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	Speaking on Monday in Jerusalem, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor said he had no intention of getting into a slanging match with Iranian officials, adding that Israel was used to being on the receiving end of incendiary rhetoric.	1	1	2		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	Israel has threatened military action against Iran unless it renounces its ambitious nuclear program, which Tehran says is purely for civilian purposes but which many countries in the West believe is designed at creating an Atomic bomb.	1	1	2		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	Obama told the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that time was running out to find a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue.	1	1	2		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	"The United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon," he added.	2	1	2		4	
314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	However, his statement represented no advance on the previous U.S. position and he appeared to ignore Netanyahu's call for Washington to establish clear red lines for Iran.	2	1	2		4

318	italy-cruise-ship-disaster-crew-win-seafaring-award-124056234--finance	The citation for the award said the crew provided "true examples of courage and professionalism" during the dangerous night evacuation of the ship after it was fatally holed by a rock off the Tuscan island of Giglio.	2	2	2		4

319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	IUDs, implants urged for teen girls' birth control	1	1	2		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	CHICAGO (AP) — Teenage girls may prefer the pill, the patch or even wishful thinking, but their doctors should be recommending IUDs or hormonal implants — long-lasting and more effective birth control that you don't have to remember to use every time, the nation's leading gynecologists group said Thursday.	2	2	1		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	The IUD and implants are safe and nearly 100 percent effective at preventing pregnancy, and should be "first-line recommendations," the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in updating its guidance for teens.	2	1	1		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	Both types of contraception are more invasive than the pill, requiring a doctor to put them in place. That, and cost, are probably why the pill is still the most popular form of contraception in the U.S.	2	1	2		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	But birth control pills often must be taken at the very same time every day to be most potent. And forgetting to take even one can lead to pregnancy, which is why the pill is sometimes only 91 percent effective.	1	1	2		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	An IUD, or intrauterine device, is a small, T-shaped piece of plastic inserted in the uterus that can prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years. An implant is a matchstick-size plastic rod that releases hormones. It is placed under the skin of the upper arm and usually lasts three years.	1	1	1		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	The new guidelines don't tell teens not to use other methods, but "if your goal is to prevent a pregnancy, then using an implant or an IUD would be the best way to do this," said Dr. Tina Raine-Bennett, head of the committee that wrote the recommendations.	2	1	1		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	The organization's previous guidelines, issued in 2007, also encouraged the use of IUDs and implants among teenagers. The new guidelines go further in saying physicians should discuss the two types of birth control with sexually active teens at every doctor visit.	2	1	1		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	The gynecologists group said condoms should still be used at all times because no other birth control method protects against AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.	2	1	2		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	While it may sound surprising that such invasive contraceptives are being endorsed for teenagers, 43 percent of girls ages 15 to 19 have had sex, a government survey found. Most are using some kind of effective birth control, but only about 5 percent use the long-lasting devices, the gynecologists group said.	2	1	2		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	In 21 states, all teenagers can get contraceptives without parental permission, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks laws affecting women's health. A few other states allow it under certain circumstances.	1	1	2		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	The IUD and implant cost hundreds of dollars. The new health reform law requires health insurance plans to cover birth control without co-payments. Also, some publicly funded health clinics offer birth control free or at a reduced cost.	1	2	2		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	The American Academy of Pediatrics has been more cautious and has not endorsed specific methods of birth control, but is updating its guidance. Some pediatricians have been reluctant to recommend IUDs for teens, partly because of concerns over infection risks; an older model was blamed for infertility.	1	1	2		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	Dr. Paula Braverman, a University of Cincinnati physician involved in updating the academy's position, said the gynecologists' advice does a good job of clarifying misconceptions about IUDs and implants.	1	2	1		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	An IUD called the Dalkon Shield that was sold in the 1970s was linked to dangerous and sometimes deadly infections. Newer IUDs have been found to be safe, and the gynecologists group said the risk of pelvic infections increases only slightly during the first three weeks after insertion.	1	1	3		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	The hormonal implant has been updated, too. The newest kind uses just one thin rod; an older type no longer sold in the U.S. used six rods that sometimes didn't stay in place. IUDs and implants can be removed at any time with no lasting effect on fertility, the gynecologists group said.	1	2	1		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	"The ones on the market today are extremely safe," said Dr. Mary Fournier, an adolescent-medicine specialist at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital, who praised the new recommendations. "That is what everybody should be telling their patients."	1	2	1		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	She said she already recommends IUDs for her patients and is being trained in how to insert birth control implants.	1	2	1		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	Raine-Bennett, research director for women's health at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., said she gets mixed reactions from her patients about both methods.	1	1	2		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	"Some of them say, 'Great! Something that I don't have to think about.' Others are, like, 'Hmmm, something in my body?' It really varies," she said.	2	2	2		4	
319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	Doctors need to be sensitive to that and provide detailed information to dispel any myths and allow teens to make informed decisions, Raine-Bennett said.	2	2	1		4

320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast will abolish a 20-year-old tax break given to local cocoa grinders when the 2012/13 season starts on October 1, an official with the top grower's marketing board told Reuters on Saturday, in a victory for exporters who don't grind locally.	1	1	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	The move was announced at a board meeting of the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) late on Friday during which the body also decided to increase a key transportation-reimbursement allowance at the heart of a row threatening reform of the sector.	1	1	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	Exporters Cargill, Barry Callebaut, CEMOI and ADM, who process a portion of their cocoa domestically, all benefit from a reduced DUS ("droit unique de sortie") tax - the main cocoa export tax - and stand to lose if the tax break is scrapped.	2	2	2		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	Rival exporters say the subsidy gives the grinders an unfair advantage and cost Ivory Coast 34 billion CFA francs in 2010.	2	1	2		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	Farmers argue that this lost tax money should have been reinvested in the sector.	2	1	2		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	"The president of the (CCC) informed the board of directors of the government's decision to totally repeal the fiscal advantage given to cocoa grinders," a board member told Reuters, asking not to be named.	2	1	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	"This decision takes effect starting with the next harvest and should allow everyone to work together on equal footing," he said.	2	1	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	The government introduced tax incentives for local grinders during the 1991/1992 cocoa season to encourage investment in the country, create jobs in the cocoa sector, and increase grinding capacity.	1	2	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	Initially meant to last five years and apply only to exports during the April to September mid-crop, the incentives are now granted year-round and are currently worth about 75 CFA francs per kilogram of cocoa.	1	1	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	In 2010, Ivory Coast became the world's top cocoa grinder with a capacity of 532,000 tonnes, turned mainly into cocoa butter and powder.	1	2	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	As part of a sweeping reform of the cocoa sector, the government is aiming to locally grind half of its cocoa bean production by 2015.	2	1	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	Currently around 35 percent of beans are processed locally.	1	1	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	Cocoa grinders have however said the incentives do not give them any special advantage and that removing them could hurt the local grinding industry and even push some to move plants to neighbouring Ghana, the world's second-biggest producer after Ivory Coast.	1	1	1		4

320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	The new cocoa season opens next month under a government-led scheme that uses the proceeds from forward-selling of the crop to guarantee prices for farmers and encourage them to reinvest in their plantations.	1	1	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	The Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) is due within days to set a farmgate price, as well as a scale of cost reimbursement for exporters, including handling costs incurred to get the beans from farm to port.	1	1	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	But exporter and merchant groups have said that if the anticipated transportation and collection cost allowances are not increased, they will ignore the government's farmgate price.	1	1	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	The CCC has now informally suggested an increased allowance of 70 CFA francs per kg, but exporters have demanded an increase to 94.2 francs.	1	1	1		4	
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	"The transport and collection cost...was raised from 70 francs to 80 francs," the CCC official said.	2	1	1		4

It's amazing to look at the numbers and see the impact it can have on registration," Jack Johnson told Mashable in a phone interview. "I'm looking forward to seeing how it translates to the Internet."	2	2	1		4	
322	jack-johnson-breaks-no-social-media-rule-voter-123525067	HeadCount says that registering this year is crucial because many young voters who first cast a Presidential ballot in 2008 might be in for a surprise when they head to the polls this year. A recent survey found that seven out of 10 young people have moved in the past four years, according to the organization, and 43% of those potential voters haven't updated their voter registration since.	1	1	2		4	
322	jack-johnson-breaks-no-social-media-rule-voter-123525067	Due to new voter ID laws in some states that require voters to prove they live at the address where they are registered, this could prevent millions of people from voting on Election Day. About 52% said they didn't know or were unsure if they were registered to vote under their current address.	2	1	2		4	
322	jack-johnson-breaks-no-social-media-rule-voter-123525067	The campaign will also happen offline in more than 30 U.S. cities at locations such as transportation centers, retail stores and concerts.	1	1	1		4

322	jack-johnson-breaks-no-social-media-rule-voter-123525067	"I've always been grateful to the Internet -- without it, my music wouldn't have stood a chance," Johnson said. "Back when I got started, people were learning to burn CDs and that was great because it allowed my album to spread even though it was in limited distribution. The web can be very powerful."	2	2	1		4

323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	TOKYO (AP) — Japan posted a $9.6 billion trade deficit for August as shipments to Europe and Asian countries sank, further undermining hopes for an export-driven revival in the world's third-biggest economy.	2	1	3		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	The 754.1 billion yen ($9.6 billion) deficit in August was not much smaller than the $9.9 billion deficit reported a year earlier, the Finance Ministry reported Thursday.	1	1	2		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	Exports in August totaled 5.05 trillion yen ($64.33 billion), down 5.8 percent from a year earlier, while imports fell 5.4 percent to 5.8 trillion yen ($73.9 billion).	1	1	2		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	The strong Japanese yen has bit into exports while demand has evaporated in crisis-stricken Europe.	2	1	2		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	Meanwhile, the country's energy imports have risen following closures of most of its nuclear plants.	1	1	1		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	Japan's central bank, which on Wednesday announced it would boost the size and duration of a government bond-buying program to spur growth, forecast little change in the immediate future.	2	1	1		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	"Exports and industrial production are expected to remain relatively weak for the time being," the Bank of Japan said in its monthly report, released Thursday.	2	1	2		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	Japan has eked out small trade surpluses in some months this year but reported a record annual trade deficit for the fiscal year that ended in March.	1	2	2		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	Though the deficit for August was lower than the more than 800 billion yen that some analysts had forecast, prolonged weakness in Europe and recent friction with China, Japan's biggest overseas market, suggest the trade gap will likely persist in coming months.	2	1	2		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	Exports to Europe dived 28 percent in August from a year earlier to 484.9 billion yen ($6.2 billion) while exports to Asia — Japan's biggest overseas market — sank 6.7 percent overall to 2.84 trillion yen ($36.2 billion).	1	1	2		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	Even before a recent territorial dispute flared, sparking anti-Japanese riots across China, exports were weakening.	2	1	3		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	They fell 9.9 percent from a year earlier to 966.3 billion yen ($12.3 billion), the Finance Ministry reported.	1	1	1		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	The central bank's bond-buying program is meant to encourage borrowing and spending and make Japan's exports more competitive, while also exerting downward pressure on interest rates and on the yen.	1	2	1		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	The central bank acknowledged that Japan's economic rebound had stalled, but predicted it would return to a "moderate" recovery path in the longer term.	2	2	1		4	
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	Its report cited resilient domestic demand thanks to reconstruction in northeastern regions devastated by a March 2011 tsunami and earthquake and signs of quickening activity in the housing sector.	2	2	1		4

324	japan-tsunami-debris-turns-hawaii-170736829	A barnacle-covered seafood storage bin has been identified as the first piece of debris to arrive in Hawaii from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.	1	1	2		4	
324	japan-tsunami-debris-turns-hawaii-170736829	The blue cubed bin, about 4 feet (1.2 meters) on each side, was spotted floating off the coast of Waimanalo, Oahu, last week and was towed ashore by marine officials, according to a statement from Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR).	2	1	2		4	
324	japan-tsunami-debris-turns-hawaii-170736829	Officials said the plastic container belongs to Japanese seafood company Y.K. Suisan, Co., Ltd., based in the Miyagi prefecture, a region hit hard by the earthquake-triggered tsunami.	2	1	3		4	
324	japan-tsunami-debris-turns-hawaii-170736829	As the disaster also set off a nuclear crisis with a partial meltdown at Japan's Fukushima power plant, health officials tested the bin for radiation but did not find any abnormal levels.	2	1	3		4	
324	japan-tsunami-debris-turns-hawaii-170736829	The bin was housing gooseneck barnacles and crabs that typically live on floating debris in the open ocean.	1	2	2		4	
324	japan-tsunami-debris-turns-hawaii-170736829	Officials said the organisms are not invasive to Hawaii.	2	2	1		4	
324	japan-tsunami-debris-turns-hawaii-170736829	A few dead birds also were found inside the container.	1	1	2		4	
324	japan-tsunami-debris-turns-hawaii-170736829	The Japanese government has estimated that the tsunami swept about 5 million tons of wreckage out to sea.	2	1	4		4	
324	japan-tsunami-debris-turns-hawaii-170736829	Seventy percent of this debris is believed to have sunk offshore, but no one knows how much of the remaining 1.5 million tons are still floating in the Pacific Ocean.	2	1	3		4	
324	japan-tsunami-debris-turns-hawaii-170736829	A handful of these lost parts have already turned up on or near the west coast of North America, from a small boat that washed up on a remote island in British Columbia to a large Japanese fishing ship that officials had to sink off the coast of Alaska.	1	1	2		4

326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Jets' Revis cleared, says 'I'm playing' at Miami	2	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — Darrelle Revis is back in action for the New York Jets.	1	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	The All-Pro cornerback was cleared Thursday for contact in practice for the first time since suffering a concussion in the team's season opener.	1	2	2		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	And, as far as Revis is concerned, there's no doubt whether he'll be on the field against the Dolphins in Miami.	2	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"I'm playing," Revis said after practice.	2	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"The doctors cleared me, so I'll be playing Sunday."	2	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	He has no more restrictions, and just to show how ready he is, Revis jokingly added: "I can bang my head on a wall if I want to."	2	2	2		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Coach Rex Ryan was also optimistic about Revis' chances of playing Sunday, but said before practice that he'll lean on the team's doctors before saying the cornerback will definitely be on the field in Miami.	2	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"If it's not the final hurdle, I don't want to be saying something that isn't true," Ryan said.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"Hopefully he'll play, but I guess we'll see."	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Revis practiced fully Thursday after passing all required tests.	1	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	He needed to be cleared by the team physician and an independent neurologist to participate in contact drills.	1	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Revis was injured Sept. 9 against Buffalo when he was accidentally kicked in the head by teammate Bart Scott while attempting a tackle.	1	1	2		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	The cornerback said he didn't need to be re-evaluated after practice anymore since he was cleared medically, so barring a setback, Revis will be back in the Jets' secondary on Sunday.	2	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"I think you feel good when you have the best player on the field," Ryan said.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"That can't hurt you.	3	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	... There's only one Darrelle Revis.	1	1	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	I know I feel great about it.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	It's hard not to smile if he's out there.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	You feel great as a playcaller."	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	And it comes at a good time for the Jets (1-1), who take on the AFC East-rival Dolphins (1-1) in a game with some early importance.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"This is a must-win for us," Revis said.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"We need this win.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	The expectations are high for us to go down there and get a win Sunday."	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Revis didn't travel with the Steelers for the game in Pittsburgh after not being cleared for contact late last week.	1	1	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	He said he felt as though he were in "a fog" right after he was injured, but progressively felt better.	2	2	2		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"Today, it felt good," Revis said.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"I actually got a couple jams in on press (coverage) and got physical with some guys.	3	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Contact actually felt good today, hitting guys and guys were hitting me back."	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Revis added that he felt pretty good Wednesday, too, and told the trainers that he didn't want to wear the red non-contact jersey in practice.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	His presence will be a big boost to the Jets' defense, which received solid play from Kyle Wilson in his place, but Revis is considered by many to be the best player in the league at his position.	3	4	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"I'm definitely happy that he's cleared for contact," Ryan said.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"Without question, I'm happy about that, for his sake.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	He loves to play, but if he's healthy, I think that's the big thing.	3	4	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	As a coach, having probably, if he's not the premier defensive player in the league, he's certainly up there, so having him as a player, obviously, you're happy for that also."	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Without Revis on the field, the Jets allowed Ben Roethlisberger to throw for 275 yards and two touchdowns.	1	1	2		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	He also had a passer rating of 125.1.	1	1	2		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"I'm just one guy," Revis said.	3	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"I'm just happy to be back."	3	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	The challenge this week for the Jets will be defending do-it-all running back Reggie Bush, but having Revis in the lineup will help them try to shut down the Dolphins' receivers and force rookie Ryan Tannehill into making mistakes.	3	3	2		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"Having a special player like Darrelle, we ask him to do a lot of different things," Ryan said.	3	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"A lot of times, we put him one-on-one with a guy, on a team's best receiver and roll coverage away from him.	3	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	He's just that kind of guy."	3	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Tight end Dustin Keller (right hamstring) and safety Eric Smith (hip/knee) were upgraded Thursday to limited after not practicing Wednesday.	2	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Getting Keller back would also be a big help to the offense, which struggled last week without the tight end on the field.	2	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Keller injured his right hamstring in the Jets' second preseason game against Carolina, and then tweaked it again during practice last Wednesday.	1	1	2		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"We'll see how he goes through practice today, but it's much better than yesterday when he was out," Ryan said.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"Hopefully, that is a sign that he'll play this week."	3	2	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	Fullback John Conner (right knee), linebacker Bryan Thomas (hamstring), defensive back Ellis Lankster (lower back) and safety LaRon Landry (heel) didn't practice — although Landry's absence was expected.	2	1	2		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	The team gives him one day off from practice each week to reduce wear and tear on his heel, which caused him to miss the end of last season with the Washington Redskins.	2	2	2		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	___					4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	NOTES: Landry was called for a personal foul for a late hit last week and another for a horse-collar tackle, but Ryan enjoys the safety's aggressive style.	2	2	2		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"I love the fact he has a reputation as a huge hitter because he's clean," the coach said.	3	3	1		4	
326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"There isn't anybody saying he's not a clean player.	3	3	1		4

326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	"When I'm in the game, I'm not thinking about a penalty I'm about to have or anything like that," he said.	3	2	2		4

330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	NEW YORK (AP) — Viewers of Katie Couric's talk show were doubtless surprised on Monday when, during the discussion of eating disorders, Couric disclosed that she had had her own struggles with that cruel, sometimes deadly condition.	3	1	3			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	"I wrestled with bulimia all through college and for two years after that," she said, describing the guilt she felt at eating a single cookie or chewing a stick of gum that wasn't sugar-free.	1	1	3			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	But the bulk of the show was devoted to her guests, who included experts on the subject as well as its sufferers, notably singer and new "X Factor" judge Demi Lovato.	1	1	2			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	During the hour, Couric said little more about her experience, which she had never before made public.	1	1	1			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	"I kind of hesitated to even bring it up," she told The Associated Press after the taping. "But I felt that if I expect people on my show to be honest, then, when relevant, I owe it to people watching to be honest myself.	1	2	1			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	"I wanted to focus on my guests," she said, "while acknowledging one of the reasons this issue is so important to me: I went through it."	1	1	1			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	It's all part of a balance Couric is striving for on her new syndicated daytime show, "Katie," between sharing her experiences and turning her show into a personal confessional.	1	1	1			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	But in an exclusive interview with the AP, Couric, 55, shared details about the illness that first plagued her as a senior at Yorktown High School in Arlington, Va.	2	1	3			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	It began, she said, when she learned she had been turned down by the college she most wanted to attend.	1	1	2			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	Couric was a likely candidate for an eating disorder.	1	1	2			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	"Like a lot of young women, I was struggling with my body image," she said, "and feeling like I wasn't good enough or attractive enough or thin enough."	2	1	3			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	She termed her figure at the time as "curvy," and not the cultural ideal, which she identified as "five-foot-eight and weighing 115 pounds. It can be so difficult to embrace the body that you have if it doesn't fit with the ideal. Women get praised for being super-thin, so you keep striving to be that way."	3	1	3			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	She said her disorder "ebbed and flowed" through the years.	3	1	3			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	"Some periods were worse than others, when I was binging and purging a lot," she said. "I'd have a piece of gum that wasn't sugarless and then say, 'Oh! I've been bad,' and then feel so terrible that I would eat and throw up. It was awful.	1	1	3			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	"But what I'm describing is something so many people have gone through or are going through," she noted, "and it's so damaging, both psychically and physically."	2	1	4			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	Couric attended the University of Virginia, then landed her first job at the ABC News bureau in Washington, D.C. And even then, she was waging a battle with food.	1	1	3			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	With the help of a therapist, she had a grip on her condition by her early 20s, though "it didn't mean that I didn't still have issues and feel bad about myself."	1	2	2			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	But since then, she said, "I've learned how to have a much healthier relationship with food, and how to enjoy my life without obsessing about food."	1	3	1			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	She said she was glad she had shared with viewers her ordeal with bulimia, "because it's so commonplace."	1	2	2			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	And it's not the first time Couric has let the public in on a personal ordeal. Her audience shared her pain from the death of her husband, Jay Monahan, of colon cancer in 1998. The tragedy led Couric, then a co-anchor of "Today," to become an advocate for colon cancer awareness and for colonoscopies. In 2000, she underwent a colonoscopy on the air.	2	2	4			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	"The educational aspect far outweighed any personal embarrassment I might have felt," she explained. "I had just lost my husband at 42 to this No. 2 cancer killer of men and women. I had a bully pulpit from which I could implore people to take steps that could potentially save their lives. It was a no-brainer."	3	2	4			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	In the future, viewers of "Katie" can expect her to confide in them again when it feels right.	1	2	1			
330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	"I don't think there are any huge revelations about myself that need to be shared or would be appropriate to share," she said. "But I'm trying to strike the right balance of talking about my situation, but not focusing on it so much that I'm being put on the couch."	2	2	1

332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Kenyan warships shelled the southern Somali port of Kismayu overnight after al Qaeda-linked rebels said they had abandoned the city, residents said on Sunday.	1	1	3			
332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	Stunned by an assault by sea, air and ground forces late on Friday night, al Shabaab rebels fled the city that had been their key source of revenue, retreating to surrounding forests and towns.	3	1	3			
332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	The shells may have been targeting any remaining pockets of resistance or military installations in the city that was the rebels' last stronghold.	1	1	3			
332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	"The ships were firing deafening shells to the outskirts last night but several shells landed on houses," said Samira Ismail, a local mother of four.	3	1	3			
332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	Al Shabaab said two children were killed and other people injured by the shells, a statement rejected as propaganda by Kenyan military spokesman Col. Cyrus Oguna.	2	1	5			
332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	Kenyan and Somali troops sent to retake Kismayu from the rebels were still in the town's outskirts, Oguna said, proceeding carefully in case al Shabaab's claim that it had abandoned the city was a ploy to lure them into a trap.	1	1	3			
332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	"The troops are consolidating and making plans to expand into the southern part of the city," Oguna told Reuters.	1	2	1			
332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	"A lot of caution must be exercised here. We don't want to get into a situation where we start to lose troops here and there."	1	1	2			
332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	The southern part is the city center and whoever wins it will effectively have control over the port and other strategic installations.	2	2	1			
332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	The Kenya Defence Force and the Somalia National Army, fighting under the flag of the African Union force in Somalia (AMISOM), have not suffered any casualties in the operation, Oguna said.	1	3	1			
332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	An al Shabaab official said that although the group had ceded control of Kismayu, its fighters were poised to engage the allied troops once they enter the city.	1	1	3			
332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	"We are just waiting for the AU and Somali troops to enter the town. We shall fight them in streets and alleys. We abandoned the town. Why don't they go in if they have the guts?" Sheikh Hudayfa Abdirahman, the group's head of Jubba region, told Reuters.	1	1	3

332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	The rebel group, which counts foreign al Qaeda-trained fighters among its ranks, is seen as one of the biggest threats to stability in the Horn of Africa.

333	kenyan-shilling-steady-vs-dollar-eyes-inflation-094749348--business	NAIROBI (Reuters) - The Kenyan shilling was steady against the dollar but could come under pressure if figures due Friday show inflation is still falling, which could drag down investor returns from government bonds.	2	2	2		4	
333	kenyan-shilling-steady-vs-dollar-eyes-inflation-094749348--business	Typically, lower inflation cause yields on government securities to be cut and interest rates to be lowered, which make it cheaper for importers to access credit and commercial banks to hold long dollar position, weighing on the shilling.	1	2	2		4

333	kenyan-shilling-steady-vs-dollar-eyes-inflation-094749348--business	At 0832 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 85.20/40 versus the dollar, barely changed from Thursday's close of 85.25/45.	1	1	1		4	
333	kenyan-shilling-steady-vs-dollar-eyes-inflation-094749348--business	Inflation in the east African nation soared last year to peak at nearly 20 percent in November, due to a widening fuel import bill and drought, which dragged the shilling through a series of record lows.	2	1	3		4	
333	kenyan-shilling-steady-vs-dollar-eyes-inflation-094749348--business	A tight monetary policy adopted by policymakers in the fourth quarter of 2011 helped bring down inflation for nine straight months and stabilised the foreign exchange rate.	1	2	1		4	
333	kenyan-shilling-steady-vs-dollar-eyes-inflation-094749348--business	Policymakers embarked on an easing cycle in July, slashing the benchmark central bank rate by a total 500 basis points in two meetings to 13 percent, in order to support economic growth.	1	2	1		4

334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	It’s no secret that there’s an obesity epidemic in America.	2	1	2			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	But the side effects from being overweight, including cancer risks, continue to multiple.	1	1	2			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	Early treatment of prostate cancer, one of the most common cancers in men, is usually very successful.	1	2	1			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	But ScienceDaily reports today that, ”obesity increases the risk of aggressive prostate disease.	1	1	2			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	New research, published in BioMed Central's open access journal BMC Medicine, finds that the fat surrounding the prostate of overweight or obese men with prostate cancer provides a favorable environment to promote cancer growth.”	1	1	2			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	While they note that fat “is a major player in the immune system, which protects the body from infection and disease,” the bad news is that “too much fat can cause these systems to go haywire and can increase the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.”	1	1	2

334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	And this new research shows that, “Regardless of type of prostate disease the overweight men had different levels of gene activity in the fat surrounding their prostates compared to the lean men.”	1	1	2			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	To put things in perspective, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) says that in “One study, using NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, estimated that in 2007 in the United States, about 34,000 new cases of cancer in men (4 percent) and 50,500 in women (7 percent) were due to obesity.	1	1	2			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	The percentage of cases attributed to obesity varied widely for different cancer types but was as high as 40 percent for some cancers, particularly endometrial cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma.”	1	1	1			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	Earlier this year, the journal Science observed that, “Insulin and a related hormone known as insulin-like growth factor (IGF) are now at the center of a growing wave of research around the world aimed at elucidating what many scientists consider to be their critical role in fueling a wide range of cancers.	1	1	1			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	Elevated levels of insulin and IGF are also the leading candidates to explain a significant correlation in epidemiology that has gained attention over the past 30 years: Obese and diabetic individuals have a far higher risk than lean healthy people of getting cancer, and when they do get it, their risk of dying from it is greater.”	1	1	3			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	Furthermore, in March, USA Today reported, “Although the overall rate of new cancer cases is declining . . .	1	2	1	S		
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	excess weight and a sedentary lifestyle are risk factors for one-quarter to one-third of common cancers in the USA.	1	1	2	S		
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	About one-third of adults—almost 78 million—are obese, roughly 30 or more pounds over a healthy weight."	1	1	2			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	They go on to quote physician Marcus Plescia, director of the division of cancer prevention for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who said, "I don't think Americans understand the association between cancer and obesity . . .	2	1	2			
334	know-already-being-overweight-bad-know-cancer-041610420	We do know people are afraid of cancer.	2	1	2

335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	For me it was the end of a journey that had begun more than four decades earlier, even before Armstrong took his “one small step” onto the Sea of Tranquillity, during the summer I turned 13.	3	3	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Watching him on TV at the Apollo 11 pre-flight press conference in 1969 I sensed something special about him, a thoughtful, articulate nature that seemed to set him apart even from other astronauts.	4	4	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	He quickly became for me a hero among heroes, a kind of superman.	5	5	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	And yet, I heard him say before and after Apollo 11 that he was not unique, not deserving of special praise, a message I managed to absorb even as I idolized him.	3	4	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	I’d already been lucky enough to meet several Apollo astronauts, but now, as a full-fledged Apollo fanatic, meeting Neil Armstrong became one of my fondest hopes—not quite an obsession, but close.	4	5	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Two years later, in September 1971, on a sightseeing trip to Washington D.C., with my parents, I dragged them to NASA Headquarters.	3	2	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	There I learned that Armstrong, no longer an active astronaut, actually had his office in that building.	2	2	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	I could hardly believe what I was hearing.	3	2	2		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	In that moment, the rest of the world fell away, and I had a mission.	3	2	2		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	The next morning, despite my mother’s skepticism ("You can’t just go down there and meet Neil Armstrong!"),	3	2	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	I took a taxi by myself back to NASA.	1	1	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	[Photos: Neil Armstrong Remembered]				I	4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Making my way down the long corridor to Armstrong’s office, barely containing my excitement, I reached my goal only to be told by his secretary that he wouldn’t be in that day.	3	4	2		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Dejected, I headed back toward the elevators.	3	1	3		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	But then, as I looked up, my gloom vanished: there was Armstrong, carrying his briefcase, walking toward me.	4	4	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	I told him, "I'm about as interested in space as you can get."	5	4	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Minutes later, I had the autograph I had longed for, but there was one more thing I had to have: A photo.	4	4	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	I had brought along my dad’s little Minox camera, but there was no one else in the hallway where we stood.	2	2	2		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Armstrong offered to take the picture himself, holding the Minox with one outstretched hand and pointing it back at us.	1	2	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	And then, before we parted, I tried to communicate to him that I understood he was not a superman but a flesh-and-blood human being.	3	3	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Armstrong didn’t say anything in response.	1	1	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Looking back, I'm pretty sure he didn't know what to make of this 15-year-old who looked much younger, with a mop of hair, saying such things.	3	3	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	But I was on a nirvana cloud.	5	5	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	I had met my ultimate hero.	5	5	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Seventeen years later, in October 1988, I was once again face-to-face with Armstrong in Washington, this time to interview him for my book "A Man on the Moon."	2	1	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	By now I knew only too well his reputation for reticence and his reluctance to grant interviews, but I had managed to win his cooperation.	3	2	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Still, I wasn’t sure what to expect from this encounter.	1	1	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Armstrong had warned me on the phone a couple of weeks earlier not to expect him to answer personal questions; he would only talk about "matters of fact."	2	2	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	And yet, as the interview progressed, we connected.	1	1	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	He answered my questions about Apollo 11 with intelligence and humor.	2	3	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	When I asked about the experience of taking the first human footsteps on the moon, he surprised me by saying that for him, “The emotional moment was the landing.	3	3	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	That was human contact with the moon… And the business of getting down the ladder, to me, was much less significant.	3	3	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	You know, I wouldn't have focused on that at all except that the press and everyone was making so much of a big thing about the exit from the vehicle and step on the surface with the boot.”	3	2	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	I shouldn’t have been surprised: Neil Armstrong was the essence of the engineering test pilot.	2	2	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	And when I asked about the enormous role in which fate had placed him as the first human being to walk on another world, his answer revealed a man who saw himself in the broad sweep of human achievement.	3	3	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	"I don't focus on self-satisfaction and being first," Armstrong told me.	2	2	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	What mattered to him, he said, were the contributions he’d helped make to Apollo and the other programs he’d worked on, things that helped get humanity "to a new plateau to look from.	3	3	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	That’s just the way I tend to look at things."	3	2	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Interviewing Neil Armstrong was one of the highpoints of my professional career.	2	3	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	In the years that followed, I got an even greater gift, as he and I became friends.	3	4	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Anytime I saw him, whether at an Apollo anniversary event, in the SPACE.com	3	4	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	boardroom, or even in a more private, social setting, I delighted in his warmth and humor.				S	4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	I valued his feedback on my work.	3	3	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	And I cherished knowing a man who in every way lived up to the role in which fate placed him.	3	4	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Neil Armstrong went to the moon with the supreme self-confidence and skill necessary to carry out history’s ultimate test flight.	3	5	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	When he returned, despite his innate shyness, he showed the strength of character to carry out the mission we gave him, one for which there could have been no adequate preparation: to be a world icon.	3	5	1		4	
335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	Now that he is gone, I feel how blessed I am to have known him, and how lucky we all were to have experienced this singular human being, ideally suited for a singular place in history.	4	5	1		4

338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Orchestra was called the world's greatest not long ago, welcome recognition for musicians outside a top cultural center.	3	4	1		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Now its members are locked out of Orchestra Hall, stuck in the same kind of labor-management battle recently afflicting teachers and football referees.	2	1	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Across the country, symphony and chamber orchestra executives have cited flat ticket sales and slumping private support as they seek major pay concessions from musicians, who warn about a loss of talent and reputation.	2	1	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	In Minneapolis, the Minnesota Orchestra has already cancelled concerts through Nov. 25 as negotiators argue over a proposal to trim the average musicians' salary by $46,000 a year.	2	1	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	A similar standoff is underway across the Mississippi River at the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.	1	1	1		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	The Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra has canceled the first month of its season in a labor impasse, and labor troubles are also rumbling at orchestras in Richmond, Va., Jacksonville, Fla., and San Antonio, Texas.	2	1	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	"It breaks my heart," said Christal Steele, a violinist and assistant concertmaster in Indianapolis, where she and fellow musicians have gone without pay and benefits for almost a month.	3	1	3		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	"This is my 40th season, and in that time, I have seen nothing but this orchestra rise in quality and in stature.	3	3	1		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Now in one fell swoop, they're trying to erase the last 30 years."	3	1	3		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Last week, musicians and management at the symphony orchestras in both Chicago and Atlanta reached new contracts after contentious negotiations.	1	2	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Atlanta's musicians went without pay for a month before accepting $5.2 million in compensation cuts over two years, plus reductions in their ranks.	1	1	3		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	The Chicago deal came after a two-day strike that forced the cancellations of the season's first Saturday night show, with musicians wrangling salary increases but agreeing to pay higher health care costs.	1	2	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	"It's shaking up a lot of organizations right now," said Drew McManus, a Chicago-based consultant to orchestras and other arts organizations.	3	1	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	"This world of orchestras is one that's always been defined by well-established strata — the best orchestras in the country, the second tier and so on — and that is very much in flux at the moment."	3	2	1		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	The Minnesota Orchestra has seen its reputation grow in recent years under conductor Osmo Vanska.	2	2	1		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	The Finnish-born Vanska has become something of a celebrity in a state that treasures its Scandinavian heritage, and he's won international acclaim for pushing the orchestra to new heights.	3	4	1		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	After seeing the Minnesota Orchestra play at Carnegie Hall in 2010, The New Yorker's classical music critic Alex Ross wrote that they "sounded, to my ears, like the greatest orchestra in the world."	4	5	1		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	But the orchestra's leaders have said even as its reputation grows they've seen flat attendance, declining corporate and individual support, and poor results from investments.	3	2	3		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Meanwhile, salaries grew by 3 to 4 percent annually under the previous contract.	1	1	1		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	"You couple that with one of the worst financial markets of the last 100 years, and obviously you have to reset our orchestra and our organization in terms of looking to a future that's sustainable," said Michael Henson, the orchestra's president.	4	2	4		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	He said the orchestra has been forced to draw too deeply from its endowment to stay in the black.	2	2	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	"A very significant part of our expenses are musicians' salaries, and that's a logical area for us to address to find a solution for long-term stability," Henson said.	3	2	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Management's proposal would trim average annual salaries for orchestra members from $135,000 to $89,000.	2	1	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Doug Wright, the Minnesota Orchestra's principal trombonist and a member of the musicians' negotiating team, said the wages reflect the skill involved in reaching the top level and big salary cuts would result in a loss of talent.	3	2	3		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	"The musicians of a major American symphony orchestra live in a global marketplace," Wright said.	3	2	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	"And if we're going to continue to attract and retain the best of the best, our competition is not, you know, the local marching band.	3	2	1		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Our competition is Boston, Chicago, L.A., San Francisco."	3	1	1		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	McManus, the arts consultant, said the Detroit Symphony Orchestra took a big blow to its reputation after a six-month musicians' strike in 2010, during which many musicians quit.	3	1	3		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Musicians have demanded an open audit of the orchestras' finances, complaining about a $50 million renovation of Orchestra Hall's lobby now underway.	3	1	3		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Henson said renovation funds come from dedicated donations and are needed to keep drawing audiences and big donors.	2	1	1		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	Jesse Stone, president and chief executive officer of the League of American Orchestras, which doesn't take sides in labor-management disputes, said orchestras are struggling with the economy like many other businesses that depend on discretionary spending.	3	1	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	"These are big cultural trends that are affecting the movie business, and professional sports, and the way our culture operates now," he said.	3	1	2		4	
338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	"So it's not surprising that we're likely to see a period of visible experimentation in American orchestras and the way they operate."	3	1	2		4

339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - 'Home cooking' has helped the United States win the Ryder Cup all but three times on American soil but former captain Bernhard Langer has already proved once that he has the recipe for European success.	3	2	1		4	
339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	Eight years ago, Langer led Europe to a record victory by 18-1/2 points to 9-1/2 at Oakland Hills and the meticulous German believes his continent can triumph again this week by using a similarly subtle mix of various ingredients.	3	2	1		4	
339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	Though Langer believes home advantage will give the U.S. a slight edge over holders Europe at Medinah Country Club, he expects the winning margin to be wafer thin, whichever team prevails.	2	1	1		4	
339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	"There are lots of little things a captain can do that could have an influence positively or negatively on a Ryder Cup," the twice Masters champion told Reuters on Wednesday a short distance from 18th green on Medinah's No. 3 Course.	1	1	1		4

339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	Asked what advice he would give to European captain Jose Maria Olazabal for this week's showdown, Langer replied: "To communicate well to his players, to keep them happy, especially those guys who are not playing.	2	2	1		4	
339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	"He has to figure out his best players on the course and if he puts someone out and if he is not confident enough or not playing well, he needs to give him a rest, give him a chance to work out his game or his putting stroke or whatever it is and hope he will be ready for the singles.	2	1	1		4	
339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	"If he has someone who is hot, let him play.	2	2	1		4

339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	The fact that four players have to sit out each of the foursomes and fourballs sessions on the Friday and Saturday gives the captain a public relations headache, according to Langer.	2	1	2		4	
339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	"Those guys sitting out are not going to be happy," said the German, a veteran of 10 Ryder Cups as player.	2	1	2		4

339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	Langer, who won his two Green Jackets at the Masters in 1985 and 1993, predicted that this week's Ryder Cup would be a very close contest.	1	1	1		4

339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	"The golf course is set up a little different than most golf courses with no rough which is unheard of nowadays.	1	1	1		4

339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	Langer, an official patron of the Ryder Cup who is a global ambassador for Mercedes-Benz, said home advantage at a Ryder Cup related to the crowd atmosphere and not to the course.	2	1	1		4

340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	BEIRUT (Reuters) - Large parts of Aleppo's covered market, the largest of its kind in the world and a UNESCO world heritage site that traces its history back to the 14th century, have been reduced to ashes as government forces and rebels fight for control of the city.	1	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	The historic market was largely undamaged by earlier fighting in Syria's largest city, but in the early hours of Saturday some of its shops caught fire during clashes in circumstances that remain unclear.	1	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	The flames spread rapidly, partly because many of the small retail units tucked beneath the market's ancient arches were full of fabric, and have now ravaged at least 1,500 shops and are still burning, activists said.	1	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	"It is not only the souk that is burning, my heart is burning as well," said an anti-government activist called Hashem who learnt the craft of jewelry-making in the souk before the revolt against President Bashar al-Assad erupted last year.	2	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	The souk's devastation is a reminder of how the 18-month-old conflict - in which both sides are struggling to gain the upper hand and activists estimate 30,000 people have been killed - is destroying Syria's rich cultural and historical legacy as well as the lives of its 22.5 million people.	2	1	3		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	Aleppo's old city is one of several places that UNESCO, the United Nations cultural agency, has designated world heritage sites and which are now at risk.	1	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	UNESCO believes that five of Syria's six world heritage sites have already been damaged. Other heritage sites include the ancient desert city of Palmyra, the Crac des Chevaliers crusader fortress and parts of old Damascus.	2	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	It was not immediately clear how the fire in the market started but activists accused government forces of using incendiary bullets to attack rebels who had taken up positions there after launching a new offensive in the city on Thursday.	2	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	"The fighters tried to put out the fire but failed to do so because snipers were shooting at them," another activist said.	1	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	"The fire is still raging and at least 1,500 shops have now been burnt down."	1	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	The market - Souk al-Madina - comprises a network of vaulted stone alleyways and carved wooden facades and was once a major tourist attraction and a busy cosmopolitan trading hub on the ancient Silk Road from China.	1	2	1		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	Its many narrow alleys have a combined length of 13 km (8 miles) making it the largest covered market in the world and it sells everything from soap to jewelry to clothing.	1	2	1		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	ANGER TOWARDS THE REBELS	2	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	Activists said they were working to try to document the scale of the damage, which it is estimated it will cost millions of dollars to repair.	1	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	Some anti-government activists have privately expressed anger towards their own fighters for taking up positions in the old city. "We all know that this is a criminal regime and it will do anything," said one activist who declined to be named. "That is why the fighters had no business being in the souk. Why did they go there?"	2	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	But other activists defended the rebels' behavior.	1	1	1		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	"The fire spread as far as the Umayyad Mosque, the fighters who managed to stop it from spreading even further," an activist from the city called Yasser said.	1	2	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	"For all those asking why the fighters are in the Old City, we say we have only entered to liberate it"	1	2	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	Rebels said they were involved in heavy clashes in Aleppo on Sunday, saying they had attacked the Neirab military air base. They also reported fighting in Arkoub, east of the city.	1	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	The failure of either side to break the military deadlock is reflected diplomatically, with foreign powers divided over how to act. Western states and Gulf Arab countries back the opposition but most seem reluctant to interfere, while Russia, China and Iran back Assad.	1	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	Speaking to a conference of the ruling AK party in Turkey, Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi - who has said he opposes military intervention in Syria - said he favored a diplomatic solution facilitated by the Arab League, the United Nations and individual countries across the world.	1	2	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	He said the Syrian people were being "butchered and killed day and night" and that he fully backed their struggle to overthrow Assad.	1	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	"We will not be calm, we will not settle down until this bloodshed stops and until the will of the Syrian people to choose their own leader is realized and until this current oppressive leadership disappears," he said.	2	1	3		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	"This oppressive regime is spilling the people's blood and the Syrian people must gain full liberty."	1	1	2		4	
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	Activists reported fresh clashes in Damascus suburbs on Sunday and at least eight bodies were reported to have been found in the northern suburb of Barzeh.

340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	Syrian state television said a suicide bomber had killed at least four people in the northern city of Qamishli.

341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	A last hurrah at the 50th New York Film Festival	1	1	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	NEW YORK (AP) — When the playwright Tony Kushner recently grabbed a microphone and sat down for a post-screening Q&A with a filmmaker and the film's cast, he mumbled that he felt like Richard Pena.	2	1	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	So central has Pena been to film in New York over the last 25 years that for many merely sitting in front of a movie screen here is likely to bring him to mind. As the programming director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and chairman of the New York Film Festival selection committee, he's one of the city's most devoted advocates of global cinema.	2	2	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	This year's New York Film Festival, the 50th, is also Pena's last. After 25 years, Pena is retiring at the end of the year.	1	1	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	"I'd be really pleased to be known as the person who kept the — what I think — extremely high level of the festival constant," Pena said in a recent interview in Lincoln Center's Walter Reade Theater. "That indeed I was given a trust in 1988 and I didn't screw up."	3	2	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	Most would give him far more credit than that. Pena has overseen film at Lincoln Center through a tumultuous period that's seen the graying of art house audiences, the birth of digital filmmaking and distribution, the exponential growth of film festivals and the shift of the art film's epicenter away from Europe and toward the Middle East, Asia and South America.	2	2	2			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	It hasn't always been easy — critics have claimed narrowing relevancy for the NYFF — but most see in "The Festival" an exalted, uncorrupted platform of some of the best in movies. When the 50th NYFF begins Friday, it will be much how it's always been: a carefully curated, highly-selective few dozen films from around the world, including choice offerings from international festivals and highly anticipated fall films from Hollywood.	3	3	2			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	The premiere of Ang Lee's "Life of Pi," a 3-D adaptation of the fantastical bestseller, opens the festival. "Sopranos" creator David Chase's directorial debut, "Not Fade Away," is the midway centerpiece. And the Robert Zemeckis drama "Flight," starring Denzel Washington, will close the fest.	1	1	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	The rest of the 32 movies in the main slate include films from Noah Baumbach ("Frances Ha"), Brian De Palma ("Passion"), Olivier Assayas ("Something in the Air"), Michael Haneke ("Amour," the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes), Cristian Mungiu ("Beyond the Hills") and Abbas Kiarostami ("Like Someone in Love").	1	1	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	This year's festival promises to be a milestone, celebrating the NYFF's past and its future. Along with various 50th anniversary celebrations, Pena will be feted in one of two galas (the other is for Nicole Kidman, star of Lee Daniels' "The Paperboy," an entry in the main slate). But the festival has also responded to a changing landscape by expanding: A three-screen theater opened last year, allowing the Film Society to broaden its offerings and add some less stuffy events, like a reunion of the cast of Rob Reiner's 1987 comedy classic, "The Princess Bride."	2	3	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	The 59-year-old Pena, who also teaches film at Columbia University, has seen the passion that accompanied the art house of the '60s — when films by Godard, Truffaut, Antonioni were met with fervor — wane: "Something happened along the way there and I don't really know what it was."	1	1	2			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	In festival programs and retrospectives, Pena has sought to expand the horizons of contemporary cinephilia, trumpeting directors like Kiarostami, Pedro Almodovar, the Dardenne brothers, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Chao-sheng and Edward Yang.	1	2	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	"In terms of international cinema, I would love to take a bow for that," says Pena. "But on the other hand, you have to realize, I had much greater access to that kind of work than my predecessors did. I mean, VHS tape was invented in 1985 and I came in 1988."	1	3	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	Rose Kuo, executive director of the Film Society, says Pena "very much took a lead" in bringing foreign films to Americans.	1	1	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	"When everybody else was looking right, he decided to look left and search out what other regions were producing interesting work," says Kuo.	2	2	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	Fittingly, the first festival Pena oversaw opened with Almodovar's "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown." The Spanish director has since been a regular at the festival. In a book planned for release this fall on the festival, Almodovar writes of the resonance of the festival and its director: "At that moment I initiated a dialogue with New York City and its cinephiles that has only increased in intensity, fun, variety and passion."	2	3	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	It was Koch, the longtime administrator of the Film Society, who hired Pena, formerly the program director at the Art Institute of Chicago. His arrival, initially in a lesser role, was promptly expanded in wake of the acrimonious exit of Richard Roud, who had been program director for the festival's first 25 years and was also hired at age 34.	1	1	3			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	"Things were simpler in those times and in hiring Richard, I believe I made the most important decision of my 32 years as administrator of the Film Society," says Koch. "After the first year, I knew he would make it to 25 — and probably another 25, if he wanted to work 24/7 a few more decades."	3	2	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	Pena will be succeeded by not one but two: Programmer and sometimes documentarian Kent Jones will be director of programming of the festival, and critic Robert Koehler will be director of programming year-round for the Film Society.	1	1	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	With three kids ranging in age from 15-24, Pena says he's "winding down a bit" and will likely occupy himself by organizing smaller programs here and there and doing series of lectures.	1	1	1			
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	"I always think that there's stuff out there," he says of film. "If you're willing to move a little bit and make a tiny bit of effort, you can discover all kinds of wonderful things."	2	3	1

344	led-zeppelin-dodges-reunion-issue-film-promotion-165625765	LONDON (Reuters) - The surviving members of British rock band Led Zeppelin on Friday sidestepped the question of whether they would perform together again, and the closest their legions of fans may get is a film of their last concert in 2007.	1	2	2		4	
344	led-zeppelin-dodges-reunion-issue-film-promotion-165625765	The group that brought the world tracks like "Whole Lotta Love", "Kashmir" and "Stairway to Heaven" reunited five years ago at London's O2 Arena for a tribute gig to Ahmet Ertegun, the founder of Atlantic Records which signed Led Zeppelin in 1968.	1	2	1		4	
344	led-zeppelin-dodges-reunion-issue-film-promotion-165625765	It was one of the few times the band performed together since breaking up following the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980, and sparked frenzied speculation that a lucrative reunion tour could be on the cards.	2	2	1		4	
344	led-zeppelin-dodges-reunion-issue-film-promotion-165625765	That has failed to materialize, and at a press conference to promote the new video of the 2007 gig, called "Celebration Day", lead singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page and bass/keyboard player John Paul Jones all refused to be drawn on future plans.	1	1	2		4	
344	led-zeppelin-dodges-reunion-issue-film-promotion-165625765	Asked whether they might consider reuniting, Page, considered one of the greatest guitarists in rock history, replied: "Can I ask you a question? You've all been to see the film. Did you enjoy it?"	2	2	1		4	
344	led-zeppelin-dodges-reunion-issue-film-promotion-165625765	From a mostly partisan crowd of journalists and fans, the answer was in the affirmative. "Then we've done our job," added the silver-haired 68-year-old.	1	2	1		4	
344	led-zeppelin-dodges-reunion-issue-film-promotion-165625765	When a reporter called out would Led Zeppelin "do it again", Plant simply replied: "With you?"	1	1	1		4

344	led-zeppelin-dodges-reunion-issue-film-promotion-165625765	"It was appropriate and it was wonderful and also his vigor was so fantastic too," said Plant. "He drove us, you know. It was peculiar and strange at times, but at the same time it was very rewarding for all of us."	2	3	1		4

345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Hundreds of Libyans handed in weapons left over from last year's war on Saturday, part of a drive by the North African country to rid its streets of arms and crack down on rogue militia groups.	1	2	2		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	As the day went on, a trickle of people turned into longer lines in Tripoli and in the eastern city of Benghazi, where tents were set up in squares for military officials to collect arms, explosives and even rocket propelled grenade launchers.	2	1	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	Amid a celebratory atmosphere, women and children looked on as men queued to turn over their weapons as they listened to a military marching band and pop music.	2	3	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	"We want our country to be safe and secure ... We don't want to see weapons anymore," Tripoli resident Mohammed Salama said, as he stood in line to hand over a rifle.	3	3	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	"We want to live our lives.	2	2	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	The time of war is over."	3	2	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	Libya's new rulers have struggled to impose their authority on a country awash with weapons, and many Libyans are fed up with militias, formed during the war but which still patrol the streets and often take the law into their own hands.	3	1	3		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	A September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, in which the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed, was followed by anti-militia protests in the city last week, increasing pressure on the authorities to tackle insecurity.	1	1	3		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	The government has since taken a twin-track approach - vowing to dissolve rogue militias that operated without official government permission, but also offering public backing to many of the most powerful armed groups, which have official licenses to operate, as it seeks to build stronger security forces.				i	4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	Saad Bakar, head of a small brigade in Benghazi, handed over rifles and ammunition on Saturday, saying he was ready to disband his group.	1	1	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	"We were waiting until today to make sure that the weapons go to the right place," he said.	2	2	1		4

345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	In Benghazi, an organizer said more than 800 people had been registered as having come to the collection point.	1	1	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	In Tripoli, an army official did not give an exact figure but said the number had superseded expectations of around 200 people.	1	1	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	One participant said he had even heard that a tank had been handed over.	1	1	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	Those numbers suggest a fraction of the arms that spilled out of Muammar Gaddafi's arsenals have been handed over but the initiative is seen as a step forward in a country where many still keep their weapons citing a precarious security situation.	1	2	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	"I want to live in a peaceful place where only the police and army have arms," Benghazi businessman Ibrahim Ali said after handing over a machine gun.	3	2	1		4

345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	"When I can call the police and they are able to arrive quickly, then I can give them that weapon," he said.	3	1	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	The collection drive is a collaboration between the army and a private television station which drummed up support through live broadcasts from Tripoli and Benghazi.	1	1	1		4	
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	Organizers in both cities, who said the event would be repeated in other cities, planned to raffle off prizes, including cars at the end of the day-long collection.	1	2	1		4

346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) — Hundreds of protesters stormed the compound of one of Libya's strongest armed Islamic extremist groups Friday, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building as the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador and four other Americans sparked a public backlash against armed groups that run rampant in the country and defy the country's new, post-Moammar Gadhafi leadership.	3	1	5		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Armed men at the administrative center for the Ansar al-Shariah militia, suspected to have led the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Benghazi consulate, first fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually withdrew from the site with their weapons and vehicles after it was surrounded by waves of protesters shouting "No to militias."	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to see people in uniform," said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover, which protesters said was done in support of the army and police.	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi in a rally against armed militias.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	A vehicle was also burned at the compound, which was taken over by Libyan security forces after its occupants fled.	1	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	For many Libyans, last week's attack on the U.S. Consulate in the eastern city of Benghazi was the last straw with one of the biggest problems Libya has faced since Gadhafi's ouster and death around a year ago — the multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the regular armed forces and police.	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Gadhafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's revolution, providing security where police cannot.	2	2	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals and carrying out killings.	2	1	4		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Militias made up of Islamic radicals are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their hardline ideology.	2	1	3		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar al-Shariah led the attack on the U.S. consulate.	1	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar al-Shariah.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"No, no, to militias," the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard.	2	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	They carried banners and signs demanding that militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"Benghazi is in a trap," signs read.	3	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"Where is the army, where is the police?"	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Other signs mourned the killing of U.S. Amb.	1	1	3		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Chris Stevens, reading, "The ambassador was Libya's friend" and "Libya lost a friend."	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the protesters.	2	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Several thousand Ansar al-Shariah supporters lined up in front of their headquarters in the face of the crowd, waving black and white banners.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	There were some small scuffles, but mostly the two sides mingled and held discussions in the square.	2	2	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of Gadhafi in August 2011.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	The unprecedented public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been unable to rein in the armed factions.	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Residents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar al-Shariah and other militias.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of Benghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists.	2	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	During the Gadhafi era, it was the hotbed of a deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.	3	1	3		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	During the revolt against him last year, Gadhafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and ally itself with al-Qaida.	1	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.	2	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation.	3	1	4		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	It was disastrous," said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio show he hosts.	3	1	3		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"We felt that the revolution is going in vain."	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Al-Shedwi said some were afraid that if they don't act to rein them in, the U.S. will strike against the militias, pushing people to support the gunmen.	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias disband.	1	2	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests.	1	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are killed.	4	2	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put an end to the "state of terrorism" created by the militias.	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	At the city's main hotel, The Jewel of Darna, tribal figures, activists, local officials and lawmakers have been meeting in recent days to come up with a plan.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"Until when the tribes will remain silent," cried a bearded young man standing on a podium at one such meeting Thursday.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"The militias don't recognize the state.	1	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	The state is pampering them but this is not working anymore.	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	You must act right now." Elders in traditional Libyan white robes stood up and shouted in support.	2	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna.	1	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked, reportedly beaten or stabbed.	1	1	4		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and assassinations of former officers from Gadhafi's military.	1	1	5		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Darna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists.	2	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	In the ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare Western songs.	2	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	And many are impatient with Ansar al-Shariah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law.	3	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	The group's name means "Supporters of Shariah Law."	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"We are not infidels for God sake.	2	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street," said Wassam ben Madin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising against Gadhafi.	1	1	3		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"This is not the time for talk about Shariah.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Have a state first then talk to me about Shariah."	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"If they are the 'supporters of Shariah' then who are we?" he said.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	"We don't want the flag of al-Qaida raised over heads," he added, referring to Ansar al-Shariah's black banner.	1	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Youssef, said, "We will talk to them peacefully.	1	2	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	We will tell them you are from us and you fought for us" during the civil war against Gadahfi.	1	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	But "if you say no (to integrating into the) police and army, we will storm your place.	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	It's over."	2	1	1		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias.	2	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	The armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.	1	1	2		4	
346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	So the government has created a "High Security Committee" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to integration.	1	1	1		4

347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Light rainfall and abundant sunshine across most of Ivory Coast's main cocoa regions last week will encourage healthy output as the new harvesting season opens, farmers and analysts said on Tuesday.	1	3	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	The main crop harvest in the world's top cocoa producer opens on October 1.	1	2	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	While improved weather in recent weeks is helping to ease worries that outbreaks of fungal disease caused by poor conditions in July and August could affect production, fears that a sweeping reform of the sector may disrupt supply persist.	2	2	2		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	Farmers said that most regions were primed for a healthy start to the season but continued rains and sunshine would be needed until November to ensure robust output through January.	1	2	2		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	In the western region of Soubre, in the heart of the Ivorian cocoa belt, one analyst reported 9 millimetres of rainfall compared with 18mm the previous week.	1	1	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	"We're set to have lots of good quality cocoa for the first two months of the main crop," said Lazare Ake, who farms on the outskirts of Soubre.	2	2	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	"If we have good rains and lots of sunshine in October and until early November, we'll have an abundant harvest until January," he said.	3	3	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	Similar growing conditions were reported in the western regions of Duekoue, Gagnoa and Meagui and in the southern regions of Divo and Agboville.	1	1	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	In the western region of Daloa, responsible for a quarter of Ivory Coast's national output, farmers reported two good showers during the week.	1	2	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	"The flowers are still coming out.	1	1	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	It's a good sign and that is encouraging going forward.	1	2	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	Harvesting has started on most of the plantations and there are lots of ripe and nearly ripe pods on the trees," said local farmer Laurent Kouakou.	2	2	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	In the southeastern region of Aboisso, farmers reported two light showers and abundant sunshine after two weeks without rain.	1	2	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	"More and more beans are being dried in the villages in the region.	2	1	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	The harvest will be good, because there is now less black pod (disease)," said Aboisso farmer Etienne Yao.	2	2	2		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	In the eastern region of Abengourou, one analyst reported 42mm of rains, which followed a week without showers.	1	2	1		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	"Looking at the trees, we don't think there will be a lot of cocoa in October, but there will be lots of beans in November and December," said farmer Marcellin N'Da.	3	2	2		4	
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	A sweeping reform of the top world grower's cocoa sector is meant to provide its farmers with a minimum price for their produce and is a key condition for debt relief under the IMF-World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) scheme - a vital part of its bid to rebuild after last year's post-election conflict.				i	4

349	lindsay-lohan-scuffles-man-york-hotel-012407879	(Reuters) - Actress Lindsay Lohan was involved in a scuffle with a man at a New York hotel on Sunday, police said, over what media reports described as her demand that photos of her be deleted from his cellphone.	2	1	3		4	
349	lindsay-lohan-scuffles-man-york-hotel-012407879	Investigators took reports from both Lohan, 26, and the man, but charges appeared unlikely, said a spokeswoman for the New York City Police Department.	2	1	2		4	
349	lindsay-lohan-scuffles-man-york-hotel-012407879	A misdemeanor assault charge filed earlier in the day against the man was dropped, the spokeswoman said.	1	1	2		4	
349	lindsay-lohan-scuffles-man-york-hotel-012407879	Police declined to confirm local media reports identifying the man as Christian LaBella, 25, of California, a staffer with Congressman John Shimkus, an Illinois Republican.	1	1	2		4	
349	lindsay-lohan-scuffles-man-york-hotel-012407879	"Nobody's been arrested, there's no assault," the police spokeswoman told Reuters.	1	2	2		4	
349	lindsay-lohan-scuffles-man-york-hotel-012407879	"Reports were taken and both parties were able to give their account of what took place."	1	1	1		4	
349	lindsay-lohan-scuffles-man-york-hotel-012407879	Lohan's spokesman Steve Honig earlier in the day said Lohan suffered minor injuries in what he described as an attack, and said her assailant was arrested.	2	1	2		4	
349	lindsay-lohan-scuffles-man-york-hotel-012407879	"Lindsay was victim of an assault," Honig said.	3	1	3		4

350	linkedin-introduces-twitter-feature-influencers-090059502	LinkedIn has reason to wade cautiously into this Twitteresque feature. While fake accounts and off-subject tweets are part of that social network's charm, unleashing the same on LinkedIn could destroy its niche as a sober forum for business. As such, the activity of the initial 150 will be different than their Twitter feeds. "People come here for a purpose," Roth says. "They're at work or thinking about work. It's not about their personal lives."	1	1	2		4

350	linkedin-introduces-twitter-feature-influencers-090059502	The addition of the program is the latest evolution for the nine-year-old LinkedIn, which was initially little more than an online Rolodex. Over time, the site has emerged as a social network with its own hive of activity. Twitter's decision in June to no longer let users tweet to LinkedIn may have actually helped the company overcome criticism that it's a low-engagement network: PageLever, an analytics tool for Facebook Pages, found that the Twitter disentanglement actually prompted a 1,000% increase in page referrals from Facebook. Since the Twitter breakup, LinkedIn also ushered in a redesign that made it look more like Facebook or Google+.	2	2	2		4

355	low-early-windows-8-adoption-numbers-sound-alarm-194045320	Microsoft (MSFT) had better hope that early adoption numbers aren’t a reflection of consumer interest in Windows 8, because if they are then the company could be headed for a Vista-style disaster.	3	2	4		4	
355	low-early-windows-8-adoption-numbers-sound-alarm-194045320	ComputerWorld reports on new numbers from research and analytics firm Net Applications showing that just 0.33% of all Windows-based computers ran on Windows 8 in September.	3	1	2		4	
355	low-early-windows-8-adoption-numbers-sound-alarm-194045320	For comparison’s sake, ComputerWorld notes that 1.64% of Windows-based computers were running on Windows 7 the month before it was released in 2009, meaning that the early adoption rate of Windows 7 was roughly five times that of Windows 8. Needless to say, if these numbers are reflection of how people feel about Windows 8, then it adds a lot more weight to some of the harsh criticisms hardware and software vendors have been lobbing at Microsoft in recent months.	2	2	4		4

356	low-returns-hurt-demand-german-10-debt-sale-101433276--finance	LONDON (Reuters) - Germany failed to attract enough demand to meet its 5 billion euro target at a sale of 10-year bonds on Wednesday, as a record low rate of return deterred investors despite doubts over when Spain would seek a bailout.	2	1	2		4	
356	low-returns-hurt-demand-german-10-debt-sale-101433276--finance	German authorities had to pick up 36 percent of the debt after commercial banks bought just 3.951 billion euros of the issue, meaning the sale was technically uncovered.	1	1	2		4

358	lyor-cohen-leave-warner-music-224815927	NEW YORK (AP) — Lyor Cohen, the chief executive of Warner Music Group Corp.'s recorded music division, is resigning at the end of September.	1	1	2		3	
358	lyor-cohen-leave-warner-music-224815927	The company announced the move Monday.	1	1	1		3	
358	lyor-cohen-leave-warner-music-224815927	Cohen was credited with restructuring the division after joining Warner in 2004.	1	2	1		3	
358	lyor-cohen-leave-warner-music-224815927	During his tenure, Warner had hits with artists such as The Black Keys, Bruno Mars and Cee Lo Green.	1	2	1		3	
358	lyor-cohen-leave-warner-music-224815927	Cohen told artists and employees in a statement to "'keep on keepin' on' in the tradition of a company that respects and honors the artistic community."	1	2	1		3

359	magnetic-therapy-help-tinnitus-patients-162200017	Tinnitus is such a distracting condition that many who suffer from it develop depression. Illinois researchers are conducting a study to determine whether magnetic therapy can help people who suffer from this debilitating condition and depression. One of my parents struggled for years with depression related to this hearing problem.	2	2	4			
359	magnetic-therapy-help-tinnitus-patients-162200017	Researchers at Loyola University Medical Center are testing a new therapy known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), according to Newswise. Since 2009, it has been used to treat patients with major depression who have not been helped by at least one antidepressant.	1	3	2			
359	magnetic-therapy-help-tinnitus-patients-162200017	Tinnitus is a ringing or noise in the ears that affects about 20 percent of the population. The Mayo Clinic says that tinnitus is actually a symptom of an underlying condition like hearing loss related to age, a circulatory system disorder, or an ear injury. Sometimes medication is the cause.	1	1	3			
359	magnetic-therapy-help-tinnitus-patients-162200017	Patients hear unpleasant sounds even in silence: buzzing, clicking, roaring, whistling, and hissing. They can affect one or both ears, intermittently or all the time, from a low pitch to a high squeal. This annoying problem causes some patients to develop depression.	2	1	3			
359	magnetic-therapy-help-tinnitus-patients-162200017	Most people automatically associate tinnitus with musicians, audiences, or teachers subjected to loud music. However, some of those at highest risk are military personnel, who experience loud noise in their work, according to the American Tinnitus Association. Tinnitus ranks first for veterans from all periods of service as a service-related disability.	1	1	2			
359	magnetic-therapy-help-tinnitus-patients-162200017	Other risk factors include being older than 65, male, or Caucasian. Age-related hearing loss and having post-traumatic stress disorder are factors. Common treatments include addressing an underlying health condition and using various devices and techniques that mask the symptoms. However, there is no cure.	1	1	4			
359	magnetic-therapy-help-tinnitus-patients-162200017	The Loyola study is the first to follow subjects with both tinnitus and depression. Once the patient is comfortable, researchers place a magnetic coil next to the left side of the head. The coil transmits short pulses of magnetic fields to the brain, producing currents that stimulate brain cells.	1	2	3			
359	magnetic-therapy-help-tinnitus-patients-162200017	During each 35- to 40-minute treatment, these currents affect mood-regulating portions of the brain. Since patients need no anesthesia or sedation, they can immediately resume normal routines. The only reported side effects are mild headaches and a tingling in the scalp. Each subject receives five treatments a week for four to six weeks and is evaluated by a doctor three times.	1	2	2			
359	magnetic-therapy-help-tinnitus-patients-162200017	From her late 60s until her death at 81, my mother complained about a constant ringing in her ears. It was also apparent that she suffered from a significant hearing loss. When various attempts to relieve the noise failed, she took antidepressants for several years. Doctors now believe that these drugs can make tinnitus worse. If the misery she suffered was typical, it's easy to see why tinnitus patients with depression would be eager to try magnetic therapy.	3	2	4

362	man-awarded-7-million-eating-too-much-popcorn-175500081	The man awarded $7 million for eating too much popcorn	1	2	2		4	
362	man-awarded-7-million-eating-too-much-popcorn-175500081	A Denver man has just won $7.2 million in damages from the makers and sellers of his favorite snack — microwave popcorn. Wayne Watson, 59, ate bags of the stuff every day for years, and developed a potentially fatal condition known as "popcorn lung." What is this odd-sounding ailment, and is the company that made the treat really to blame? Here, a brief guide:	3	2	2		4	
362	man-awarded-7-million-eating-too-much-popcorn-175500081	What exactly is popcorn lung?It's the informal name for a rare ailment called bronchiolitis obliterans, an irreversible respiratory illness that causes wheezing, dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Patients have scarring in the bronchioles, the lung's smallest air passageways, and the damage makes it harder for them to breathe. Some people stricken with "popcorn lung" require lung transplants. In severe cases, it can be fatal.	2	1	3		4	
362	man-awarded-7-million-eating-too-much-popcorn-175500081	SEE ALSO: 100 orgasms a day: One woman's agonizing and rare medical disorder				I	4	
362	man-awarded-7-million-eating-too-much-popcorn-175500081	How do you get popcorn lung?It's relatively common in people who have been exposed to high levels of diacetyl, an artificial flavoring used to give popcorn a buttery taste. Workers in factories that make microwave popcorn are the ones who usually suffer from it. The Centers for Disease Control recommends that anyone subjected regularly to the chemical wear a respirator and get regular breathing tests. Hundreds of popcorn-factory workers have sued over diacetyl exposure — winning settlements as high as $34 million — but Watson was the first consumer to go to court.	1	1	2		4	
362	man-awarded-7-million-eating-too-much-popcorn-175500081	Did Watson really get sick from eating popcorn?That's what he says — or at least, from inhaling popcorn fumes — and the jury sided with him. Watson says he first noticed something was wrong when he was singing in his church choir and couldn't "sustain notes like I used to." He went to a pulmonary specialist, who figured his problem had to be tied to something he was inhaling. On a hunch, the doctor asked Watson if he had been exposed to a lot of popcorn. Watson's jaw dropped.	2	1	2		4

362	man-awarded-7-million-eating-too-much-popcorn-175500081	How much popcorn did he eat?Watson told his doctor he had been eating two or three bags a day for 10 years. Later, air quality tests in his kitchen showed diacetyl contamination at factory levels when he was making popcorn. Not only that, but Watson said he used to savor inhaling the smell when he ripped open the bag. Now he won't go near the stuff.	2	1	2		4	
362	man-awarded-7-million-eating-too-much-popcorn-175500081	Is this really the fault of popcorn makers?Watson argued that a simple warning label would have been enough to keep him safe. "They thought that no consumer would ever be exposed to enough of it to make a difference," he says. "Well, they rolled the dice and they lose." The legal teams for Gilster-Mary Lee Corp, which manufactured the popcorn Watson bought, and supermarket chain The Kroger Co., which sold it, argued that Watson couldn't prove he fell ill because of his snack habit. They said he got sick because he worked with carpet-cleaning chemicals his entire career. Neither company had any immediate comment on the verdict, although the manufacturer issued a statement saying it was weighing its next step, and maintaining that its popcorn is perfectly safe.	2	2	2		4

365	man-mounts-protest-dome-st-peters-223001280	Video footage showed the man, identified as Marcello Di Finizio, jumping over railings near the top of the 137-m- (450- ft-) high dome on Tuesday afternoon, shocking visitors taking a tour.	2	1	2		4	
365	man-mounts-protest-dome-st-peters-223001280	He then tied a cord to the railings and abseiled to a ledge over a window in the cupola.	1	1	1		4	
365	man-mounts-protest-dome-st-peters-223001280	Tottering on the ledge, Di Finizio unveiled a banner reading: "Help!	2	1	2		4

368	markets-falter-focus-remains-spain-110647752--finance	LONDON (AP) — Markets stuttered Friday as investors continued to fret over the economy of Spain, which this week announced big spending cuts it hopes will convince potential bailout creditors and investors it has a rock-solid plan to heal its public finances.	1	1	2		3	
368	markets-falter-focus-remains-spain-110647752--finance	The positive momentum generated by Thursday's Spanish budget has ground to a halt as investors await more news out of the country, including stress test results into 14 banks that are due after European markets close.	1	2	2	I	3

369	markets-steady-spain-bailout-hopes-111759583--finance	Though those concerns remain, investor optimism was shored up Friday by hopes that Spain was negotiating with its partners in the eurozone on a new economic reform program.	1	2	1		3

371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has discovered what appears to be an ancient streambed, suggesting that water once flowed in large volumes — perhaps hip-deep in places — across the Martian surface.	1	2	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	Photos from the Curiosity rover have revealed several different rocky outcrops that contain stones cemented into a layer of conglomerate rock.	1	2	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	Some of these stones are rounded and large, indicating that they were transported relatively long distances across the Red Planet surface by water.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	This water flow was likely quite vigorous, perhaps akin to the flows produced by flash floods in desert areas here on Earth, researchers said.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	"From the size of gravels it carried, we can interpret the water was moving about 3 feet per second, with a depth somewhere between ankle and hip deep," Curiosity co-investigator William Dietrich, of the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	[The Search for Water on Mars (Photos)]				I	3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	"Plenty of papers have been written about channels on Mars with many different hypotheses about the flows in them," Dietrich added.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	"This is the first time we're actually seeing water-transported gravel on Mars.	1	2	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	This is a transition from speculation about the size of streambed material to direct observation of it."	1	2	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	The findings came after researchers studied photographs of three different outcrops inside Gale Crater, where Curiosity touched down on Aug. 5.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	The first outcrop, known as Goulburn, lies a few feet from the rover's landing site.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	Curiosity spotted the other two — called Link and Hottah — as it's been rambling toward an area called Glenelg, its first major science target.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	Photos of Link really got the team thinking of long-ago stream flows, Curiosity chief scientist John Grotzinger, of Caltech in Pasadena, told reporters today (Sept.	1	2	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	27).				S	3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	And images of Hottah, which juts from the Red Planet surface at an odd angle, pretty much sealed the deal.	2	2	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	"Hottah looks like someone jack-hammered up a slab of city sidewalk, but it's really a tilted block of an ancient streambed," Grotzinger said in a statement.	1	1	2		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	On Earth, tilted outcrops are usually the result of tectonic activity.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	But Hottah could have been deformed by a nearby impact or other process, Grotzinger said.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	The water on Mars likely flowed several billion years ago, researchers said, though an exact timeframe will be tough to determine.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	But the extent of the system that produced the outcrops — and the surrounding alluvial fan and channels — suggests that it wasn't produced in a single shot.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	Rather, water was likely flowing over a relatively long chunk of time, scientists said.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	"I'm comfortable to argue that it's certainly beyond the thousand-year timescale, but we're still gathering data to go further with that," Dietrich told reporters today.	1	2	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	The team has not yet analyzed Link or Hottah with Curiosity's 10 different science instruments; rather, the researchers' conclusions are based on images of Mars snapped by the rover's Mast Camera.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	But those pictures capture plenty of evidence, Grotzinger said.	1	2	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	"In some cases, when you do geology, a picture's worth a thousand words," he said.	1	2	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	The $2.5 billion Mars rover Curiosity is about 50 days into a roughly two-year mission to determine if the Gale Crater area has ever been capable of supporting microbial life.	1	2	2		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	Despite the outcrop discoveries, the six-wheeled robot's ultimate destination remains the base of Mount Sharp, a 3.4-mile-high (5.5 kilometers) mountain that rises from Gale's Center.	1	1	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	The mysterious mountain's foothills show signs of long-ago exposure to liquid water.	1	2	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	"A long-flowing stream can be a habitable environment," Grotzinger said.	1	2	1		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	"It is not our top choice as an environment for preservation of organics, though.	1	1	2		3	
371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	We're still going to Mount Sharp, but this is insurance that we have already found our first potentially habitable environment."	1	2	1		3

372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	BOSTON (AP) — A Massachusetts chemist accused of faking drug results, forging paperwork and mixing samples at a state police lab in a case that has thrown thousands of criminal cases into doubt was arrested Friday.	2	2	3		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	Annie Dookhan, 34, was led to a police cruiser at her home in Franklin, about 40 miles southwest of Boston.	1	1	2		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	Dookhan's alleged mishandling of drug samples prompted the shutdown of the Boston lab last month and resulted in the resignation of three officials.	2	1	3		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	State police say Dookhan tested more than 60,000 drug samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the lab.	1	1	1		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	Defense lawyers and prosecutors are scrambling to figure out how to deal with the fallout.	3	1	3		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	Since the lab closed, more than a dozen drug defendants are back on the street while their attorneys challenge the charges based on Dookhan's misconduct.	1	1	3		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	Many more defendants are expected to be released.	1	1	3		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	Authorities say more than 1,100 inmates are currently serving time in cases in which Dookhan was the primary or secondary chemist.	1	1	1		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	The scandal prompted the resignation of the state's public health commissioner and the resignations of two others.	2	1	3		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	Dookhan is charged with witness intimidation, a crime punishable by as many as 10 years in prison, and pretending to hold a degree, punishable by as much as a year in jail.	1	1	3		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	Dookhan had once testified under oath that she holds a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts, but school officials have said they have no record of her receiving an advanced degree or taking graduate courses there.	1	1	3		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	It is unclear whether anyone else will face charges, but Dookhan's supervisors have faced harsh criticism for not removing her from lab duties after suspicions about her were first raised by her co-workers and for not alerting prosecutors and police.	2	1	3		4

372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	Co-workers began expressing concern about Dookhan's work habits several years ago, but her supervisors allowed her to continue working.	2	1	2		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	Dookhan was the most productive chemist in the lab, routinely testing more than 500 samples a month, while others tested between 50 and 150.	1	2	2		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	One co-worker told state police he never saw Dookhan in front of a microscope.	1	1	2		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	A lab employee saw Dookhan weighing drug samples without doing a balance check on her scale.	1	1	2		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	In 2010, a supervisor did an audit of Dookhan's paperwork, but didn't retest any of her samples.	1	1	2		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	The audit found nothing wrong.	1	1	1		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	The same year, a chemist found seven instances where Dookhan incorrectly identified a drug sample as a certain narcotic when it was something else.	1	1	3		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	He told state police he told himself it was an honest mistake.	3	2	3		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	In an interview with state police late last month, Dookhan allegedly admitted faking test results for two to three years.	1	1	2		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	She told police she identified some drug samples as narcotics simply by looking at them instead of testing them, a process known as "dry labbing."	2	1	2		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	She also said she forged the initials of colleagues and deliberately turned a negative sample into a positive for narcotics a few times.	2	1	3		4	
372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	She was eventually suspended from lab duties after getting caught forging a colleague's initials on paperwork in June 2011.	3	1	3		4

373	mass-lab-could-taint-1-100-inmates-cases-062414913	BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts officials say they have identified more than 1,100 defendants serving state sentences based at least partly on drug tests by a chemist accused of failing to follow protocols and mishandling samples in a now-closed state drug lab.	2	1	3		4	
373	mass-lab-could-taint-1-100-inmates-cases-062414913	David Meier, an attorney appointed to help sort through the legal quagmire, released the number on Monday.	3	1	3		4	
373	mass-lab-could-taint-1-100-inmates-cases-062414913	Officials say chemist Annie Dookhan was involved in testing more than 60,000 drug samples involving about 34,000 defendants.	2	1	2		4	
373	mass-lab-could-taint-1-100-inmates-cases-062414913	Meier says it's unclear how many of the cases might have been tainted.	2	1	2		4	
373	mass-lab-could-taint-1-100-inmates-cases-062414913	He says prosecutors and defense attorneys have been given the list because Gov. Deval Patrick has given priority to incarcerated people.	3	1	3		4

374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	BOSTON (AP) — Faced with the daunting task of evaluating more than 34,000 drug cases handled by a Massachusetts chemist accused of misconduct, prosecutors and defense attorneys are starting with 1,140 cases of people who are already serving prison sentences based on potentially tainted evidence.	2	1	3		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	David Meier, a defense attorney and former prosecutor appointed to help sort through the legal quagmire created by the chemist's alleged actions, on Monday turned over a list of 690 people currently serving sentences in state prisons and 450 who are currently serving sentences in county jails.	1	2	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Samples in all of the cases were tested by chemist Annie Dookhan, who state police say failed to follow testing protocols and deliberately mishandled evidence in some cases.	3	1	3		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Meier said it is unclear how many of those samples might have been tainted by Dookhan's actions, but said both sides want to deal first with people who are already in prison.	2	2	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	"That is our first priority, people who are presently incarcerated," he said.	3	2	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Meier said lawyers in those cases will now have to work out resolutions on a case-by-case basis.	2	1	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	"The merits and any alleged issues in any one of those cases is for prosecutors and defense attorneys and judges to determine," he said.	3	2	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	State police have said Dookhan was involved in testing more than 60,000 drug samples involving about 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the Boston lab.	1	1	1		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Dookhan resigned in March during an internal investigation by the state Department of Public Health, which ran the lab until state police took over on July 1 as part of a budget directive.	1	1	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Meier, who was appointed by Gov. Deval Patrick last week, met Monday with a group of district attorneys, defense attorneys and public safety officials.	1	1	1		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	After the meeting, Meier said he turned over a list of currently incarcerated defendants whose cases were worked on by Dookhan, either as the primary chemist, who performs an initial test on a drug sample, or as the secondary chemist, who performs a second, confirmatory test.	1	1	1		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	The list does not include thousands of people who are currently awaiting trial, are on probation or are serving federal sentences in cases in which Dookhan tested drug samples.	2	1	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Since the lab was closed last month, judges in Suffolk and Norfolk counties have already begun to hear motions filed by defense attorneys seeking bail reductions for drug defendants awaiting trial in cases handled by Dookhan.	1	1	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Prosecutors have agreed to many of those motions, citing possibly tainted evidence.	1	1	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Dookhan hasn't been charged, but the state attorney general's office is conducting a criminal investigation.	1	1	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	On Monday, a judge in Boston agreed to put the sentences of career criminal David Huffman on hold and set bail for him at $75,000 cash, with GPS monitoring.	1	1	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	The 55-year-old Huffman had pleaded guilty in August to trafficking in heroin and cocaine, possession of oxycodone with the intent to distribute and unlawful possession of ammunition and a firearm as an armed career criminal He began serving concurrent seven- to 10-year sentences last month.	1	1	4		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Huffman's lawyer, Bernard Grossberg, said the next step will likely be for the defense to ask that Huffman be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea.	1	1	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	"He would not have pleaded guilty to the gun charges if it was not part and parcel of his plea on the drug charges," Grossberg said.	4	1	3		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Dan Conley, said prosecutors opposed the motion to put his sentence on the gun charges on hold.	2	2	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	He said the gun evidence was tested in a different lab and was unaffected by the drug lab scandal.	1	1	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	"This is an individual who's been involved in just about every type of property and violent crime over the course of 40 years.	5	1	4		4

374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	"We believe the judge should have treated the two cases separately," he said.	3	2	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Dookhan has not responded to repeated requests for comment.	1	1	2		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	Her father, Rasheed Khan, told The Associated Press that she had been "bullied and abused," but he would not say by whom.	3	1	3		4	
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	"No one has heard her side of the story," Khan said outside his home in Kissimmee, Fla., on Saturday.	4	1	2		4

377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The longtime mayor of struggling Central Falls resigned and has agreed to plead guilty to a federal corruption charge of accepting gifts in exchange for handing out a lucrative contract to board up city houses, according to papers filed Wednesday by federal prosecutors.	2	2	3		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Charles Moreau and his friend, businessman Michael Bouthillette, were charged.	1	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Bouthillette was charged with one count of giving gifts, according to the documents.	2	2	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Moreau and Bouthillette acknowledge in a plea agreement that Bouthillette paid at least in part for a furnace installed at Moreau's former Central Falls home and for renovations at a home Moreau owned in Lincoln.	1	1	1		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	In exchange, Moreau used his emergency powers to order homes that were foreclosed be boarded up by Bouthillette's business.	1	1	1		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Court papers say Bouthillette boarded up at least 167 houses from 2007 to 2009 and made "unreasonable profits" of hundreds of thousands of dollars.	2	2	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	When city employees questioned the amounts Bouthillette was charging for the work, the documents show, Moreau dismissed the concerns, on one occasion telling an employee to "mind his own ... business."	2	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Moreau, who resigned as mayor effective at noon Wednesday, did not answer calls placed to his phone and a message could not be left.	1	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	His lawyer, William J. Murphy, and Bouthillette's lawyer, C. Leonard O'Brien, did not immediately return calls for comment.	1	1	1		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Central Falls had a deficit of more than $6 million on an annual budget of about $16 million by the time a state-appointed received filed for bankruptcy on its behalf, the first time ever in Rhode Island, in August 2011.	1	1	3		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Moreau was stripped of his duties — along with his key to City Hall — about a year earlier when the state stepped in.	1	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	About a quarter of the city's 19,000 residents live below the poverty level, according to census data, and the city has one of the state's highest foreclosure rates.	2	1	3		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Moreau has been the target of a yearslong investigation by federal and state authorities into whether he improperly accepted gifts from Bouthillette.	1	2	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	City Council President William Benson Jr. told the AP on Wednesday he is disappointed and that he's "sorry that it's come to this."	2	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	"It's terrible for the city," he said.	2	1	3		4

377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	The city's going through enough problems as it is."	1	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	He said he is waiting to hear from the receiver, John McJennett III, and City Hall on next steps.	1	1	1		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Under the city charter, the president of the City Council would serve as the acting mayor.	2	1	1		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	But the receiver, under state law, has the powers of both the mayor and City Council.	1	1	1		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Moreau was first elected to lead the state's smallest city in 2003.	1	1	1		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	He would have been up for election next year and planned to run again.	2	1	1		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Moreau, who sold his house in Central Falls last year but said he was staying with a friend, often referred to the receivership as a "dictatorship."	2	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	Along with several City Council members, he took a challenge of the state receivership law all the way to the state Supreme Court, arguing unsuccessfully that it violated their rights as elected leaders and infringed on the city's constitutionally-protected sovereignty.	2	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	A report on the city's financial problems by the first receiver, Mark Pfeiffer, didn't place blame solely on Moreau or the rest of the elected leadership.	1	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	It cited $80 million in unfunded pension and benefits obligations, a loss in state aid and anticipated revenue that never materialized.	1	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	But Pfeiffer also noted a "culture of government" that allowed the crisis to spiral.	1	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	A federal judge this month signed off on a five-year recovery plan for Central Falls, paving the way for its exit from municipal bankruptcy and, eventually, the return of its elected government.	1	1	2		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	State Revenue Director Rosemary Booth Gallogly will determine when the elected leadership comes back, but only after she feels confident they understand and will implement the plan.	3	1	1		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	The budget for the current fiscal year has them returning in January.	1	1	1		4	
377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	A spokeswoman for Gov. Lincoln Chafee, Christine Hunsinger, said Wednesday the governor has faith in McJennett and Gallogly to provide oversight in Central Falls.	2	1	1		4

379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - World number one Rory McIlroy and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell had a three-hole lead disappear before rising at the 18th hole to win the first point for Europe at the Ryder Cup on Friday.	1	3	1			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	The duo, sent out first by Europe captain Jose Maria Olazabal, snared a critical point from Americans Jim Furyk and Brandt Snedeker when McIlroy blasted out from a bunker to five feet and McDowell sank the par putt for a 1-up victory.	3	3	1			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	"It was a great game of golf, it really personified the Ryder Cup this morning," McDowell told reporters on the 18th green after sinking the putt that allowed Europe to finish the opening foursomes session tied 2-2.	2	3	1			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	"We played some great golf to be 3-up and two very gutsy players come back at us with a few birdies and we're playing these last two holes all square and having to hit some quality shots down the stretch."	3	3	1			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	A run of six birdies in seven holes from the fourth boosted the Europeans, who led by three holes through the 12th.	1	2	1			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	That streak was started by a chip-in by McIlroy from behind the green at the fourth that charged up the Europeans who felt wronged after Furyk had not allowed McDowell to take relief from a ball sitting close by a sprinkler head on the second hole.	2	2	2			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	The Americans, however, fought back and ran off a string of three successive birdies from the 14th to level the alternate-shot match.	1	3	1			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	At the 18th, Snedeker sent his drive way right among the oak trees and pantomimed snapping his driver in half at the tee. McIlroy's drive was also headed right but clipped a branch and dropped into light rough alongside a fairway bunker.	2	1	2			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	Furyk punched out through a tight lane to put the ball on the fairway and Snedeker stuck his approach shot about 15 feet from the cup.	1	1	1			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	McDowell's approach found a bunker below the green, but McIlroy put pressure on the U.S. by blasting out to five feet.	2	2	2			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	Furyk's right-to-left par putt broke away just inside the hole, making McDowell's putt good for a point in the European column.	1	2	1			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	"It was a great match," said 23-year-old McIlroy. "They came back at us. Unfortunately, Brandt didn't hit a very good tee shot there at the last and we were able to take advantage."	2	2	2			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	McDowell praised his playing partner.	1	2	1			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	"My job is easy. I'm playing alongside the greatest player on the planet right now," said the 2010 U.S. Open champion, who described McIlroy's sand shot as "phenomenal."	3	3	1			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	McIlroy returned the bouquet.	1	1	1			
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	"If I had to choose anyone on either of these two sides to have to hole that putt to win at the last, it would have to be G-Mac," the number one said about McDowell, who clinched the winning putt in Europe's victory over the U.S. team two years ago in Wales.	2	2	1

380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A former Penn State graduate assistant who complained he saw former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky showering with a young boy on campus in 2001 and testified at his sex abuse trial this summer sued the university on Tuesday for what he says is defamation and misrepresentation.	2	1	3		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	Mike McQueary's whistle-blower lawsuit claims his treatment by the university since Sandusky was arrested on child molestation charges in November has caused him distress, anxiety, humiliation and embarrassment. It seeks millions of dollars in damages.	2	1	3		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	Penn State spokesman Dave La Torre declined to comment on Tuesday, and McQueary's lawyer Elliot Strokoff did not return a phone message.	1	1	2		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	The lawsuit discloses that shortly after Sandusky was charged, the university's then-president, Graham Spanier, met with athletic department staff inside the football stadium and expressed his support for athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz, who had been charged with perjury and failure to properly report suspected child abuse in the Sandusky case. Spanier also issued a public statement with the same message.	2	2	2		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	Curley, now on leave, and Schultz, who has retired, have repeatedly denied the charges against them and await trial.	1	1	2		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	McQueary, whose contract with Penn State wasn't renewed, testified that he came upon Sandusky and the boy in a team shower in a sexually suggestive position on a Friday night in early 2001.	2	1	2		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	He told jurors at Sandusky's trial he heard a "skin-on-skin smacking sound" and what he saw was "more than my brain could handle." He said the boy's hands were against a wall and Sandusky was behind him, with his midsection moving subtly.	2	1	2		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	McQueary reported the episode to then-head football coach Joe Paterno, who in turn alerted Curley and Schultz. Paterno was fired after the three men were charged, and he died of complications from lung cancer in January.	1	1	3		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	McQueary claims that the November meeting with Spanier "clearly suggest(ed) that (McQueary) was lying in his reports and testimonies that he had reported the sexual misconduct."	2	1	2		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	"Spanier's statements have irreparably harmed (McQueary's) reputation for honesty and integrity, and have irreparably harmed (his) ability to earn a living, especially in his chosen profession of coaching football," the lawsuit said.	2	1	2		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	Messages left for Spanier and his lawyer on Tuesday were not immediately returned.	1	1	2		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	The lawsuit said McQueary learned his contract was not being renewed, meaning he was no longer a university employee, from a news conference held in July by the university's new president, Rodney Erickson. He said his salary last year was $140,000 and his future earnings as a coach would amount to at least $4 million.	2	1	2		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator, was convicted in June on charges he sexually abused 10 boys, some on campus. He remains jailed awaiting sentencing.	1	1	2		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	Eight young men testified against Sandusky, describing a range of abuse they said went from grooming and manipulation to fondling, oral sex and anal rape when they were boys. One young man testified his muffled screams from the basement of the Sandusky home in State College, where Penn State is based, went unanswered as Sandusky attacked him.	1	1	4		4	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	The 68-year-old Sandusky maintains his innocence, acknowledging he showered with boys but insisting he never molested them. Given his age and the serious nature of the crimes of which he was convicted, he's likely to receive a sentence that will keep him in prison for life.	1	1	3		4

381	meet-baxter-robot-common-sense-video-044626602	Priced at $22,000 and with no integration required, Baxter robots are "a fraction of the cost of a traditional industrial robot," according to Rethink.	2	1	1		4	
381	meet-baxter-robot-common-sense-video-044626602	"Baxter was specifically designed to be affordable for mid-size and small manufacturers, companies that have never been able to afford robots before."	2	1	1		4	
381	meet-baxter-robot-common-sense-video-044626602	"We [can] offer new hope to the millions of American manufacturers who are looking for innovative ways to compete in our global economy."	3	2	1		4

383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	Sticking to traditional gender roles could make you less comfortable and less safe in the bedroom.	2	2	1		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	In a new study, young adults who assumed that men should take charge during sex were less likely to feel confident in sexual situations and less perceptive to using female condoms.	1	1	2		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	The study, published online Sept. 25 in the journal Sex Roles, involved 357 women and 126 men (ages 18-29) from a public university in the Northeast, all heterosexual and sexually active.	1	1	1		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	The researchers, led by Lisa Rosenthal from Yale University, gave the students a survey to measure their sexual confidence, asking them how assertive they were about getting sexual satisfaction from a partner, using a condom and taking precautions for safer sex.	1	1	1		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	They also examined the students' support for social power inequalities and hierarchies based on their agreement with statements such as: "It’s OK if some groups have more of a chance in life than others;" and "The man should be the one who dictates what happens during sex."	1	1	1		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	(The endorsement of such power dynamics has been linked to sexism, negative attitudes toward women's rights and a greater tolerance of sexual harassment.)	1	1	2		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	In the private cubicle where the students filled out their survey, there was a bowl of female condoms with a sign that read: "Protect yourself and your partner.	1	1	1		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	Please take some!	1	1	1		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	FREE FEMALE CONDOMS."	1	1	1		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	There were small pamphlets next to the bowl about how to use female condoms, which are inserted into the vagina before sex.	1	1	1		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	The more men and women endorsed hierarchical power dynamics, the more likely they were to believe men should dominate during sex and the less likely they were to take the free female condoms and report confidence in sexual situations, the researchers said.	1	1	1		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	"If men believe that men should dominate sexually, this may prevent them from feeling open or comfortable discussing sexual behavior and protection with their partners or asking questions about things they may not know," which could lead to reduced sexual confidence, wrote the researchers.	2	1	2		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	"For both women and men, the belief that men should dominate sexually could reduce interest in female condoms, because female condoms are meant to be a woman-centered source of protection and may be seen as violating the norm or belief that men should be in control of sexual situations," Rosenthal and her team explained.	2	1	1		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	Women in the study were generally less likely than men to believe that men should dominate in the bedroom, the study's authors noted.	2	1	1		4	
383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	The researchers controlled for variables such as age, family income, number of sexual partners in the past month and perceived HIV/AIDS risk.	1	1	1		4

386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	The findings suggest suicide is not simply a mental health problem, the researchers said, but also one of men's place in societies and of societies' inability to adapt to men's needs when trying to deal with depression, anxiety and other problems.	3	1	3		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	"While suicide is mental health issue.... it is also a social and health inequality issue.	3	1	3		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	This is unjust and unreasonable," said Stephen Platt, a University of Edinburgh health policy research professor and trustee for the Samaritans, who presented the report at a briefing in London	3	1	3		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	"The differences we are highlighting in this report.. are not ones that any civilized society should be comfortable with."	2	1	2		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	While the report focused on Britain, the experts behind its findings were relevant to many developed countries across the world, especially those that have experienced a post-industrial shift to service-driven economies	2	1	1		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	It said that men in mid-life are part of a "buffer" generation, not sure whether to be like their older, more traditional, silent, austere fathers or like their younger, more progressive, individualistic sons.	3	2	2		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	"The changing nature of the labor market over the last 60 years has affected working class men," it said.	3	1	2		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	"With the decline of traditional male industries, they have lost not only their jobs but also a source of masculine pride and identity."	3	2	3		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	The World Health Organisation estimates that every year, almost a million people commit suicide - a rate of 16 per 100,000, or one every 40 seconds.	2	1	4		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	It also estimates that for every suicide, there are up to 20 attempted ones.	3	1	3		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	Men are more likely to commit suicide than women in almost every country in the world, and the WHO says the main risk factors are mental illness - primarily depression - and alcohol abuse, as well as violence, loss, abuse and pressures from cultural and social backgrounds.	3	1	4		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	The Samaritans study found that in Britain on average about 3,000 middle-aged men from disadvantaged backgrounds kill themselves each year.	2	1	3		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	Platt described the findings as "shocking" said this high risk group could no longer be ignored.	3	1	4		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	"Men are often criticized for being reluctant to talk about their problems and for not seeking help," he said.	3	1	3		4	
386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	"With this in mind, we need to acknowledge that men are different to women and design services to meet their needs, so they can be more effective."	3	2	1		4

387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	Middle East telcos mull alliance in Facebook fight	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	DUBAI (Reuters) - Middle East telecommunications firms are discussing the idea of creating a pan-Arab online platform that would earn them more revenue from their networks by challenging Facebook and other Internet behemoths of the West.	2	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	The ambitious project faces technical and financial obstacles and may never be implemented on a large scale. But proponents argue the common language and culture shared by the world's more than 350 million Arabic speakers, plus the webs of affiliated companies which Gulf operators own across the Middle East and North Africa, could make the project viable.	2	2	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	"A single operator, even one in multiple geographies and with tens of millions of subscribers, can't create this platform on its own," said Osman Sultan, chief executive of du, the second biggest operator in the United Arab Emirates.	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	"It would be restricted to the customers of this operator and wouldn't have sufficient scale to succeed. But a unified platform spanning the Arab world would," he told Reuters.	2	2	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	Sultan said he had proposed the idea to all major operators in the Arab world over the past 12 months.	1	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	Behind the proposal is a frustration shared by telecommunications firms globally: as they spend heavily to build networks, data traffic on the networks is increasing rapidly, but the firms essentially only make money from charging for access to their networks - a low-margin business.	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	The lion's share of new revenue from traffic is being taken by so-called "over-the-top" (OTT) Internet companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Twitter. The telecommunications firms have unsuccessfully pressed them for bigger contributions to the cost of building the networks.	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	"OTT players...we can't share their gain and they won't share our pain," said Sultan. "Network traffic doubles every eight to nine months, but revenue is heading to a plateau, so we need to claim part of the new revenues alongside OTT players."	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	VERY DIFFICULT	1	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	The proposed Arab online platform would feature social media and online shopping for goods and services, including digital content such as music, video and applications, Sultan said.	1	1	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	He declined to give details, saying parts of the talks were confidential, and most other Arab telecommunications operators contacted by Reuters declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment	1	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	But Sheikh Mohamed Al Khalifa, chief executive of Bahrain Telecommunications Co, welcomed the idea.	1	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	"Telcos are beginning to look to the deployment of OTT services such as streamed TV and video-on-demand," he said. "Such diversification (into) adjacent industries has become necessary. There are gains to be made by collaborating within our industry in the Middle East."	2	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	Sceptics point to the fact that efforts by telecommunications firms elsewhere in the world to set up online ventures have often failed when faced with the technical savvy and marketing muscle of the established Internet giants.	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	"Fundamentally, it's very difficult to complete against OTT players - operators lack the agility and the core competencies as well as the brand appeal," said Guillermo Escofet, a senior analyst at Informa Telecom and Media in London.	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	"They're used to running networks, not being media companies. Also, operators instinctively try to differentiate themselves from each other - it's against their DNA to work together."	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	London-listed Vodafone is one of a number of operators that have had difficulty creating Internet services. The Vodafone 360 service, based on customers' phone address books, was launched in Europe in 2009, letting customers import contacts from social networks and use an online application store. In 2011, Vodafone said it was winding down the service.	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	"Operators have failed miserably every time they have tried to move up the value chain, except for in certain business-to-business services," said Pedro Oliveira, a partner at global management consultants Oliver Wyman. "Some have tried to move into content and applications, but the war is lost already."	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	The big Western Internet firms are already popular around the Middle East. Facebook, which offers an Arabic interface, had 45.2 million users in the Arab world as of June 30, up more than 50 percent from a year earlier, according to the Arab Social Media Report, produced by the Dubai School of Government.	1	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	Despite pockets of innovation in the region, such as video game industries in Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and ventures developing applications for smart phones in Egypt, the Middle East has so far not come close to developing online products to rival the top Western Internet companies.	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	FEASIBLE	1	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	However, proponents of the telecommunications firms' online plan argue it is more feasible in the Arab world than elsewhere.	1	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	Only about 1 percent of the world's websites are in Arabic, according to a survey by analysts W3techs. Internet penetration lags regions such as Europe, North America and east Asia, with only about 86 million of the estimated 360 million native Arabic speakers online at end-2011, Miniwatts Marketing Group said.	1	1	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	Such figures may mean Western Internet firms are not yet so entrenched in the Middle East that they cannot be challenged. The new online platform would satisfy hunger among the region's young population for more Arabic-language content, said Sultan.	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	Another factor is the impressive geographical reach of Gulf telecommunications firms; if a few of them can agree on introducing the online platform, they may be able to roll it out quickly across more than a dozen countries.	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	Combined, Qatar Telecom, Saudi Telecom, Kuwait's Zain and the UAE's Etisalat cover 16 of the 22 Arab League countries. The other six countries are the smallest four in economic terms - Mauritania, Somalia, Djibouti and Comoros - plus war-ravaged Libya and Syria.	1	1	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	The Arab telecommunications operators' extensive distribution networks and point-of-sale advertising could help them win customers from OTT players.	2	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	Most Middle Eastern mobile phone subscribers are on pre-paid contracts typically topped up with scratch cards. These are sold everywhere from petrol stations to local stores, so vouchers for the online platform might easily be rolled out alongside them.	2	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	"The reach we have to consumers and the knowledge we have of consumer behavior is vast," Sultan said.	1	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	Thomas Kuruvilla, managing director of consultants Arthur D. Little Middle East, said an alliance of regional telecommunications firms could form a community of social networks that was attractive to local populations.	2	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	If the firms can cooperate on content and social networks, "it will surely attract more niche advertisers and hence higher revenue potential," he said.	2	2	1		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	However, even if the region's biggest telecommunications firms succeed with the online platform, it will be hard for smaller operators to make much money from it, said Oliveira.	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	This could consign smaller firms to serving as nothing more than low-margin pipes for the data services of the big ones.	1	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait have multiple telecommunications firms providing Internet access, and some of them may be the most vulnerable to becoming "dumb pipes". Such companies might cut access fees to their networks in an effort to win market share, Oliveira said.	2	1	2		4	
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	"If one operator takes this approach, then others in the same market may be forced to follow as they lose revenue and market share and struggle to keep on investing in their network," he said. "It's a race to the bottom."	2	1	2		4

388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An Israeli immigrant who started a signage company in his basement and spent decades building it into a successful business was among five people slain by a fired employee at a Minneapolis workplace, authorities said.	1	1	3		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Also killed were an avid sculptor and painter with a day job there and a UPS driver who made pickups and deliveries to the company for years. Police said he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.	1	1	3		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Six people — including the suspected gunman — were shot to death Thursday afternoon at Accent Signage Systems, located in a quiet residential corner of northwest Minneapolis. Police say Andrew Engeldinger, 36, was fired from the company that afternoon and responded by fatally shooting others there before he turned the gun on himself in the building's basement.	1	1	3		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Among those killed were Reuven Rahamim, 61, the company's founder; Rami Cooks, 62, of Minnetonka; Jacob Beneke, 34, of Maple Grove; Ronald Edberg, 58, of Brooklyn Center; and Keith Basinski, 50, a Wisconsin native who was the UPS driver.	1	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	No details were immediately released about why Engeldinger was fired, but Minneapolis Police Chief Tim Dolan said it appeared he singled out some victims and spared others. Engeldinger's family offered sympathy to the victims in a statement through the National Alliance on Mental Illness. It said he had struggled with mental illness for years.	1	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	"This is not an excuse for his actions, but sadly, may be a partial explanation," the statement said.	2	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Rahamim's family asked that the focus of the tragedy be on those killed rather than the gunman. Rahamim's son-in law, Chad Blumenfield, wrote in an email that he was born and raised on a farm in Israel and was a soldier in the Israeli Army before leaving for the U.S. after the Yom Kippur War, which occurred in 1973.	1	1	3		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	"He loved spending time with his children and grandchildren and especially loved to take his grandson for bike rides," Blumenfield wrote.	1	2	1		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Beneke had a wife and a young son, said Lorrie Link, who heads the Maple Grove Arts Center. She said Beneke was a volunteer there, where he displayed his work and promoted the work of other artists in the suburb northwest of Minneapolis.	1	2	1		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Beneke's Facebook page said he worked as digital imaging manager at Accent Signage Systems.	1	1	1		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	"He was just a very cool guy. He was very creative and expressive," Link said of the New Albin, Iowa, native. "His sculptures and paintings and drawings made us laugh."	2	2	1		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Basinski was a Wisconsin native dedicated to the Green Bay Packers. Dolan said he likely wasn't one of the gunman's primary targets but was killed simply because he happened to be there.	2	1	3		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Minneapolis Police Capt. Amelia Huffman said the scene at Accent Signage Systems was "very chaotic" and that it was taking time for police to put together a comprehensive chronology. She said there were more than 20 people scattered in the building when Engeldinger began firing, and witnesses only saw bits of what happened.	2	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Huffman said police believe Engeldinger got a letter of reprimand in the mail and came into the office Thursday afternoon. At that point, he was terminated.	1	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	"From the best we can tell, the incident started right after Mr. Engeldinger had been fired," Huffman said. She said there was a struggle in the office and shots were fired, which employees elsewhere in the building heard. Dolan said Engeldinger used a 9mm Glock semi-automatic pistol he had owned for about a year.	2	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	"And Mr. Engeldinger left the back office area and fired additional shots throughout the building," she said. Victims were shot throughout the building, she said.	1	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Police said the first 911 calls came in about 4:30 p.m. Thursday. Initially, three officers responded; Dolan said the shooting was over by the time they got there, and they entered the building to find a scene he described as "hellish." Dolan said those three officers were put on leave to give them time to recover.	1	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	"This scene is by far the most traumatic these officers have ever encountered," Dolan said.	2	1	3		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	It took officers a long time to secure the very large building, he said. The company had no security, and Dolan said tactical units found two people hiding "a very long time" after the attack began.	1	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Later Thursday, SWAT teams and investigators searched Engeldinger's home in south Minneapolis. There they found a second gun and packaging for 10,000 rounds of ammunition in the house.	1	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	"He obviously had this gun and was practicing how to use this gun," Dolan said.	2	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Sue Abderholden, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness' Minnesota chapter, said Engeldinger's family had sought help from the group two years ago, with his parents taking a 12-week course on recognizing and dealing with mental illness.	1	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	She said their concerns were "much more centered around paranoid thoughts. No violence or anything like that." The Engeldingers were not able to convince Andrew to seek treatment, she said.	1	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Andrew Engeldinger's uncle, Joe Engeldinger of New Germany, Minn., called his nephew a "good kid" who broke the hearts of family members when he broke off contact with them about two years ago.	2	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	"When I would see his family, I would ask them about Andy and nobody could ever tell me anything," Joe Engeldinger said.	1	1	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	Chuck and Carolyn Engeldinger raised Andrew and his two siblings in the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield, Joe Engeldinger said.	1	1	1		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	"He wasn't a monster. He wasn't," Joe Engeldinger said. "He was a real good kid, a real good person. He had a real good heart. I don't know what made all this transpire. Hopefully the truth will come out and won't get twisted into some demented thing."	2	2	2		4	
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	The Minnesota Bureau of Labor and Industry said it was the deadliest workplace shooting since the agency began tracking such events in 1992. No more than two workers had died in such a shooting before this week, according to the St. Paul Pioneer Press.	2	1	3		4

390	mitt-romneys-47-percent-disaster-actually-golden-opportunity-094500594--election	As Mitt Romney continues to stand behind his surreptitiously recorded, admittedly "not elegantly stated" contention to wealthy donors that nearly half of American voters are dependent on government handouts, nursing "victim" complexes, and unlikely to vote for him, Republicans are split between banging their heads on their desks over this "47 percent disaster" and rushing to Romney's defense.	4	2	3		4

391	mitt-romneys-strategy-win-virginia-lyme-disease-162000153--election	The image: The Weekly Standard reports that voters in Virginia are starting to receive their first mailers from the Romney campaign — and the top issue isn't the lackluster economy or the bloated budget deficit, but Lyme Disease.	1	1	1		3

391	mitt-romneys-strategy-win-virginia-lyme-disease-162000153--election	"It's a disease that begins from a small bug," reads the mailer.	1	1	2		3	
391	mitt-romneys-strategy-win-virginia-lyme-disease-162000153--election	"But Lyme Disease has quickly become the most common vector-borne disease in the United States."	1	1	2		3

391	mitt-romneys-strategy-win-virginia-lyme-disease-162000153--election	The mailer is apparently part of Romney's micro-targeting strategy, which seeks to engage voters on the local issues they care most about.	2	1	1		3

392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Advocates for people who engage in rough but consensual sex say they fear an abuse case unfolding in Missouri ultimately could criminalize their lifestyle.	3	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Ed Bagley faces a federal trial early next year on 11 counts of abuse against a woman who authorities say he groomed to be his sex slave.	1	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Now prosecutors plan to present consensual, though violent, acts between Bagley and his own wife as evidence that Bagley has a history of sexually assaulting women.	2	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	The case will include evidence of "sadistic sexual assaults" committed by Bagley against his wife, Marilyn, prosecutors say.	3	1	4		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	"Marilyn Bagley's 'consent' to the sexual assaults by Defendant Edward Bagley does not change whether the acts legally constitute assault or not.	2	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Pursuant to the Missouri state assault statute ... consent is not a defense to assault resulting in serious physical injury," prosecutors wrote in court documents filed last month.	2	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Some worry the government's assertion could open up people who practice bondage, dominance, sadism and masochism — or BDSM — to criminal charges for consensual acts they're already performing, said Susan Wright, founder of the Baltimore-based National Coalition for Sexual Freedom.	2	1	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	"We are following this case specifically because we were hoping this issue would not come up," she said.	3	1	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Ed Bagley, 45, of Lebanon, Mo., is accused of grooming a young woman to be his sex slave starting in 2002, then keeping her captive for years while making money from her images on fetish Internet sites and forcing her to work as a dancer at strip clubs.	1	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Marilyn Bagley, 47, is charged with five counts, including sex trafficking and forced labor trafficking.	1	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Both have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial in February.	2	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Prosecutors claim Bagley, known as "Master Ed," tortured the young woman and made her available to other men who came to his trailer, either to torture or have sex with her.	2	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Four men, who said they visited Bagley's trailer to watch or take part, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges.	2	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	The case came to light in early 2009 after the woman, then 23, was hospitalized after what prosecutors said was a torture session.	2	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Then-U.S. Attorney Beth Phillips called the case one of "the most horrific ever prosecuted in this district."	3	1	4		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Advocates for the BDSM community say even the most brutal acts detailed in Bagley's federal indictment are not criminal acts, as long as there was consent.	2	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	But if the woman was too young or not intelligent enough to consent, as prosecutors allege, or if she initially gave consent and then changed her mind, most who spoke with the AP said that would be criminal sexual abuse.	3	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	It's the inclusion of Bagley's acts with his wife in the case that concerns BDSM advocates and Bagley's attorney, Susan Dill.	2	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	"Like many people from all walks of life, my client and his wife engaged in what some might term alternative, but nonetheless, consensual sexual activity that they both enjoyed," Dill said in an email to The Associated Press.	3	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	"The assertion that their consensual, marital sex life is evidence of prior criminal activity is nonsensical."	3	2	1		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	As in several other states, Missouri assault laws limit instances in which consent can be used as a defense against criminal charges when serious injuries occur.	1	1	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Exceptions generally are made for athletic activities and the victim's occupation or professions in which the conduct and harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards.	1	1	1		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Wright's group contends "serious physical injury" is not well-defined under law.	2	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	"The assessment of the seriousness of harm is often affected by judges' 'moral judgments about the iniquity of the conduct,'" the organization says on its website in a section focusing on the consent issue.	3	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	"Courts tend to inflate the risk and harmfulness of an activity they want to denounce.	3	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	For example, any injury caused during a sadomasochistic encounter has been consistently classified as serious."	3	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Diana Adams, a New York attorney and sexual freedom activist who represents clients in alternative lifestyles, said the landmark 2003 U.S. Supreme Court ruling "Lawrence v. Texas" that struck down a Texas anti-sodomy law "declared we had a right to consensual sex between adults in the privacy of our own homes," but that the law is not clearly defined.	3	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	"In this kind of case, sometimes it's selectively applied," Adams said.	3	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	She said federal courts in Texas and Alabama interpreted the Lawrence decision in different ways in 2004.	2	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	The Texas court used the case to strike down a ban on sales of sex toys, citing Lawrence's privacy conclusion.	2	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	The Alabama court, however, upheld a similar ban by saying commercial sale of the toys was an issue of obscenity, not privacy.	2	1	3		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	Wright notes that regardless of the legal precedent, prosecutors' attempts to present acts between Bagley and his wife as evidence in the Missouri case also comes at a time when kinky sex practices appear to be gaining broader public acceptance amid the popularity of the E.L. James "50 Shades of Grey" bondage books.	3	2	2		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	"Because of '50 Shades of Grey,' a lot of people are trying BDSM for the first time this year," she said.	3	2	1		4	
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	"We want to be sure they understand they have to do these activities consensually, and to make sure they have the skill to do them safely."	3	2	1		4

395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	ST. LOUIS (AP) — With a string of gold albums, a hit TV series and the signature "Moon River," Andy Williams was a voice of the 1960s, although not the '60s we usually hear about.	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	"The old cliche says that if you can remember the 1960s, you weren't there," the singer once recalled.	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	"Well, I was there all right, but my memory of them is blurred — not by any drugs I took but by the relentless pace of the schedule I set myself."	3	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Williams' plaintive tenor, boyish features and easy demeanor helped him outlast many of the rock stars who had displaced him and such fellow crooners as Frank Sinatra and Perry Como.	2	2	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	He remained on the charts into the 1970s, and continued to perform in his 80s at the Moon River Theatre he built in Branson, Mo.	1	2	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	In November 2011, when Williams announced that he had been diagnosed with bladder cancer, he vowed to return to performing the following year: His 75th in show business.	1	2	3		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Williams died Tuesday night at his home in Branson following a yearlong battle with the disease, his Los Angeles-based publicist, Paul Shefrin, said Wednesday.	1	1	3		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	He was 84.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	He became a major star the same year as Elvis Presley, 1956, with the Sinatra-like swing "Canadian Sunset," and for a time he was pushed into such Presley imitations as "Lips of Wine" and the No. 1 smash "Butterfly."	2	3	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	But he mostly stuck to what he called his "natural style," and kept it up throughout his career.	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	In 1970, when even Sinatra had given up and (temporarily) retired, Williams was in the top 10 with the theme from "Love Story," the Oscar-winning tearjerker.	3	2	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	He had 18 gold records and three platinum, was nominated for five Grammy awards and hosted the Grammy ceremonies for several years.	1	3	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Movie songs became a specialty, from "Love Story" and "Days of Wine and Roses" to "Moon River."	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	The longing Johnny Mercer-Henry Mancini ballad was his most famous song, even though he never released it as a single because his record company feared such lines as "my huckleberry friend" were too confusing and old-fashioned for teens.	2	2	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	The song was first performed by Audrey Hepburn in the beloved 1961 film "Breakfast at Tiffany's," but Mancini thought "Moon River" ideal for Williams, who recorded it in "pretty much one take" and also sang it at the 1962 Academy Awards.	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Although "Moon River" was covered by countless artists and became a hit single for Jerry Butler, Williams made the song his personal brand.	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	In fact, he insisted on it.	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	"When I hear anybody else sing it, it's all I can to do stop myself from shouting at the television screen, 'No!	3	1	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	That's my song!'" Williams wrote in his 2009 memoir, titled, fittingly, "Moon River and Me."	3	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	"The Andy Williams Show," which lasted in various formats through the 1960s and into 1971, won three Emmys and featured Williams alternately performing his stable of hits and bantering casually with his guest stars.	1	2	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	It was on that show that Williams — who launched his own career as part of an all-brother quartet — introduced the world to another clean-cut act — the original four singing Osmond Brothers of Utah.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Their younger sibling Donny also made his debut on Williams' show, in 1963 when he was 6 years old.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Four decades later, the Osmonds and Williams would find themselves in close proximity again, sharing Williams' theater in Branson.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Williams did book some rock and soul acts, including the Beach Boys, the Temptations and Smokey Robinson.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	On one show, in 1970, Williams sang "Heaven Help Us All" with Ray Charles, Mama Cass and a then-little known Elton John, a vision to Williams in his rhinestone glasses and black cape.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	But Williams liked him and his breakthrough hit "Your Song" enough to record it himself.	2	2	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Williams' act was, apparently, not an act.	3	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	The singer's unflappable manner on television and in concert was mirrored offstage.	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	"I guess I've never really been aggressive, although almost everybody else in show business fights and gouges and knees to get where they want to be," he once said.	3	2	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	"My trouble is, I'm not constructed temperamentally along those lines	3	1	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	His wholesome image endured one jarring interlude.	2	2	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	In 1976, his ex-wife, former Las Vegas showgirl Claudine Longet, shot and killed her lover, skiing champion Spider Sabich.	1	1	3		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	The Rolling Stones mocked the tragedy in "Claudine," a song so pitiless that it wasn't released until decades later.	2	1	3		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Longet, who said it was an accident, spent only a week in jail.	2	1	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Williams stood by her.	1	2	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	He escorted her to the courthouse, testified on her behalf and provided support for her and their children, Noelle, Christian and Robert.	1	3	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Also in the 1970s, Williams was seen frequently in the company of Ethel Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's widow.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	The singer denied any romantic involvement.	2	1	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	He was born Howard Andrew Williams in Wall Lake, Iowa, on Dec. 3, 1927.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	In his memoir, Williams remembered himself as a shy boy who concealed his insecurity "behind a veneer of cheek and self-confidence."	3	1	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Of Wall Lake, Williams joked that it was so small, and had so little to do, that crowds would gather just to watch someone get a haircut.	2	1	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Williams began performing with his older brothers Dick, Bob and Don in the local Presbyterian church choir.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Their father, postal worker and insurance man Jay Emerson Williams, was the choirmaster and the force behind his children's career.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	When Andy was 8, Williams' father brought the kids for an audition on Des Moines radio station WHO's Iowa Barn Dance.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	They were initially turned down, but Jay Emerson Williams and the young quartet kept returning and they were finally accepted, their show bringing them attention from Chicago, Cincinnati and Hollywood.	1	2	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Another star at WHO was a young sportscaster named Ronald Reagan, who would later praise Williams as a "national treasure."	2	2	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	The brothers joined Bing Crosby in recording the hit "Swinging on a Star" in 1944 for Crosby's film "Going My Way," and Andy, barely a teenager, was picked to dub Lauren Bacall's voice on a song for the film "To Have and Have Not." His voice stayed in the film until the preview, when it was cut because it didn't sound like Bacall's.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Later the brothers worked with Kay Thompson of eventual "Eloise" fame, then a singer who had taken a position as vocal coach at MGM studios, working with Judy Garland, June Allyson and others.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	After three months of training, Thompson and the Williams Brothers broke in their show at the El Rancho Room in Las Vegas to a huge ovation.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	They drew rave reviews in New York, Los Angeles and across the nation, earning a peak of $25,000 a week.	1	2	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Williams, analyzing their success, once said: "Somehow we managed to work up and sustain an almost unbearable pitch of speed and rhythm."	1	2	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	After five years, the three older brothers, who were starting their own families, had tired of the constant travel and left to pursue other careers.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Williams initially struggled as a solo act and was so broke at one point that he resorted to eating food intended for his two dogs.	2	1	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	"I had no money for food, so I ate it," he recalled in 2001, "and it actually was damned good."	2	2	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	A two-year TV stint on Steve Allen's "Tonight Show" and a contract with Cadence Records turned things around.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	In the 1960s.	1	1	1	 	4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Williams later formed his own label, Barnaby Records, which released music by the Everly Brothers, Ray Stevens and Jimmy Buffett.	1	1	1	 	4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Williams was a lifelong Republican who once accused President Obama of "following Marxist theory."	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	But he acknowledged experimenting with LSD, opposed the Nixon administration's efforts in the 1970s to deport John Lennon, and, in 1968, was an energetic supporter of Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	When Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles in June 1968, just after winning the California Democratic primary, Williams sang "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" at his funeral.	1	1	3		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	"We chose that song because he used it on the campaign trail," Williams later said of Kennedy, who had been a close friend.	2	2	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	"He had a terrible voice but he loved to sing that song.	3	2	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	The only way I got through singing in church that day was by saying, 'This is my job.	4	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	I can't let emotion get in the way of the song.'	4	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	I really concentrated on not thinking about him."	4	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	After leaving TV, Williams headed back on the road, where his many Christmas shows and albums made him a huge draw during the holidays.	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	One year in Des Moines, however, a snowstorm kept the customers away, and the band's equipment failed to reach Chicago in time for the next night's show, forcing the musicians to borrow instruments from a high school band.	1	1	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	"No more tours," Williams decreed.	3	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	He decided to settle in Branson, the self-proclaimed "live entertainment capital of the country," with its dozens of theaters featuring live music, comedy and magic acts.	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	When he arrived in 1992, the town was dominated by country music performers, but Williams changed that, building the classy, $13 million Andy Williams Moon River Theater in the heart of the city's entertainment district and performing two shows a night, six days a week, nine months of the year.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Only in recent years did he begin to cut back to one show a night.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Not surprisingly, his most popular time of the year was Christmas, although he acknowledged that not everyone in Hollywood accepted his move to the Midwest.	2	1	2		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	"The fact is most of my friends in L.A. still think I'm nuts for coming here," he told The Associated Press in 1998.	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	He and his second wife, the former Debbie Haas, divided their time between homes in Branson and Palm Springs, where he spent his leisure hours on the golf course when Branson's theaters were dark during the winter months following Christmas.	1	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Retirement was not on his schedule.	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	As he told the AP in 2001: "I'll keep going until I get to the point where I can't get out on stage."	2	1	1		4	
395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	Williams is survived by his wife, Debbie, and his three children, Robert, Noelle and Christian.	1	1	1		4

396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	The percentage of school children obtaining exemptions from required vaccinations for nonmedical reasons is increasing, a new report says.	1	2	1		3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	In 2011, just over 2 percent of school children were exempt from getting their vaccines for nonmedical reasons, up from about 1 percent in 2006, the report found.	1	2	2		3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	"Our results show that nonmedical exemptions have continued to increase, and the rate of increase has accelerated," in recent years, the researchers at Emory University wrote in a letter published today (Sept.	1	2	1	S	3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	20) in the New England Journal of Medicine.	1	1	1	S	3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	All U.S. states allow children to be exempt from vaccination requirements for medical reasons — some children are allergic to vaccines, others have conditions that severely compromise their immune systems, and could make vaccination dangerous to a child's health.	1	2	3		3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	In addition, 48 states allow exemptions for nonmedical reasons (Mississippi and West Virginia do not).	1	2	2		3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	Nonmedical exemptions can be granted for religious reasons or philosophical reasons, though fewer states allow philosophical exemptions than religious ones.	1	2	2		3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	For their report, researchers used data on vaccine exemptions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for school years 2005–2006 through 2010–2011.	1	1	1		3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	They found that the rates of nonmedical exemptions were 2.5 times higher in states that allowed philosophical exemptions, compared with states that allowed only religious exemptions.	1	1	1		3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	However, the rate of exemptions was rising faster in states that allowed only religious exemptions, the report said.	1	1	1		3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	The researchers also looked at state exemption rates in terms of how difficult exemptions are for parents to get — some states use a standardized form to request exemptions and make this form available at schools, others require parents to go though the state health department, or require a specifically worded letter or notarization.	1	1	2		3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	Over the study period, the exemption rates were higher in states with "easy" exemption policies, compared with states with "difficult" policies.	1	2	2		3	
396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	In 2011, the average exemption rate in states with easy policies was 3.3.	1	1	1	S	3

396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	"In an earlier analysis of data from 1991 through 2004, we found an increase in exemption rates only in states with philosophical exemptions and in states with easy exemption procedures," the researchers said.	1	1	1		3

398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	For the first time, scientists have peered to the edge of a colossal black hole and measured the point of no return for matter.	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	A black hole has a boundary called an event horizon.	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	Anything that falls within a black hole's event horizon — be it stars, gas, or even light — can never escape.	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	"Once objects fall through the event horizon, they're lost forever," Shep Doeleman, assistant director of the MIT Haystack Observatory and research associate at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, said in a statement Thursday (Sept.	2	1	1	S	5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	27).	1	1	1	S	5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	"It's an exit door from our universe.	2	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	You walk through that door, you’re not coming back."	2	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	Although the event horizon is an imaginary line that's impossible to observe, astronomers have imaged the region around a giant black hole at the center of a distant galaxy, and measured, for the first time, the closest stable orbit in which matter can circle the black hole.	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	The findings were reported today in the journal Science.	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	The supermassive black hole in question lies at the center of the galaxy M87, which is about 50 million light-years from our own Milky Way.	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	This behemoth black hole contains the mass of 6 billion suns.	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	Using a new observatory called the Event Horizon Telescope, which links up radio dishes in Hawaii, Arizona and California, astronomers measured that the innermost possible orbit for matter around the black hole is roughly 5.5 times the size of the black hole's event horizon.	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	This innermost orbit is about five times the size of the solar system, or 750 times the distance from Earth to the sun, Doeleman told SPACE.com.	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	The distance between the Earth and the sun is nearly 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	The observations allowed the researchers to confirm that this swirling mass around the black hole is the source of the powerful jets of light seen radiating from the galaxy.	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	Many galaxies throughout the universe spot similar jets, thought to be produced by matter falling into their central black holes.	1	1	1		5	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	Until now, no telescope has had the resolution power to verify the idea.	1	1	1		5

399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	PEMBA, Mozambique (Reuters) - It was billed as a celebration of its socialist revolution, but when Mozambique's ruling Frelimo party marked its 50th birthday this week, Marx came a distant second to Money.	3	2	2		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	Reflecting their anti-colonial, revolutionary roots, Frelimo leaders pointedly chose a venue in the untamed corner of southern Africa where half a century ago guerrillas launched the uprising that would lead to independence from Portugal in 1975.	2	2	2		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	But beyond the symbolism of the location, in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, the obligatory use of "Comrade" and the AK-47 rifle that still adorns the national flag, everything at the party congress pointed to the huge wealth accruing to the political elite in the fast-growing energy producer.	2	1	3		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	The venue itself was a lavish complex of VIP reception rooms and cavernous dining areas, set amid a village of apartment units, two on-site banks and a hospital clinic for 2,000 guests.	2	2	1		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	Just to the north lies the Rovuma Basin, where U.S. energy firm Anadarko and Italy's Eni are exploring some of the world's biggest untapped natural gas reserves - an estimated 130 trillion cubic feet, or enough to supply Western Europe for over a decade.	2	3	1		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	To some of Mozambique's 23 million people, the talk of "revolutionary war" by Frelimo leader and President Armando Guebuza - known as "Mr.	2	2	2		4

399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	"It is absurd to spend $8 million on a week-long conference when people are starving a block away," said Rudiger Franck, a hotel owner and Frelimo party member in Pemba, the run-down seaside town that hosted the seven-day jamboree.	3	1	3		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	"It gives the impression that the party has lost touch with the reality of life for most of its members."	3	1	3		4

399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	Under its first president, U.S.-educated sociologist Eduardo Mondlane, Frelimo struck out on a Marxist course until 1990 when, tired from civil war and under growing pressure from the West, it renounced socialism.	2	2	3		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	In the last decade, mostly under Guebuza, Mozambique has become a hotbed of foreign mining investment that has lifted economic growth to 7 percent a year and in 2011 made its currency the strongest performer against the dollar.	2	3	1		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	Brazil's Vale , for instance, has poured $2 billion into a coal mine in the northwestern region of Moatize and plans to invest $6.4 billion in the years to come.	1	3	1		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	Frelimo says all Mozambicans stand to benefit, yet in a country where the average person scrapes by on $400 a year, the opulence of its congress sends a conflicting message.	2	3	2		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	"This money never reaches the people.	3	1	3		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	It remains in Frelimo's pocket," said Mustagibo Bachir, a Cabo Delgado member of parliament for Renamo, Frelimo's foe during a 16-year post-independence civil war.	3	1	3		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	Bachir sees a worrying precedent in the handling of the ruby and timber sectors in the north, which remains one of the country's poorest regions.	2	1	2		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	"Our people still don't have access to water, food or jobs," he said.	3	1	3		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	Besides Renamo, Frelimo is also facing opposition from the upstart Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), run by the 48-year-old mayor of Beira, Mozambique's second city with a population of half a million people.	2	1	2		4	
399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	Analysts say elections due in 2014 are too soon for MDM to make serious headway, but point to its popularity with young, educated and unemployed Mozambicans as a sign that it could become a force to be reckoned with later in the decade.	3	3	2		4

400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique's cashew industry is ailing, and the symptoms point to a bad bout of "Dutch disease."	1	1	2		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	In a nutshell, this illness strikes an economy when the discovery of a resource such as oil draws in a flood of dollars, boosting the local currency but making all other exports uncompetitive.	2	1	2		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	The term was coined to explain the decline of manufacturing in the Netherlands after the discovery of North Sea oil and gas in the late 1950s.	1	1	1		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	In Mozambique's case, an investment boom in the nascent coal and gas sectors hoisted the metical by a whopping 33 percent against the dollar from September 2010 to the end of 2011.	2	2	1		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	It has since held on to the bulk of those gains.	1	1	1		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	Foreign direct investment soared to $2.1 billion last year - when the metical was the top-performing currency against the dollar - compared with just $7.8 million in 2010, central bank data showed.	2	2	1		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	While the government will welcome the money, it has crushed any cashew comeback and put the livelihood of tens of thousands of peasant farmers at risk in a country where agriculture still accounts for a third of gross domestic product.	2	1	3		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	The tropical southeast African nation and former Portuguese colony was once the world's top producer of the coveted nuts, but - as with most of its economy - the industry was gutted when civil war erupted after independence in 1975.	2	1	3		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	The end of conflict two decades ago allowed the cashew sector to sprout anew, and in 2010, sales rose to a post-war peak of 113,000 tonnes, the third-highest in Africa behind Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau, according to the Ghana-based African Cashew Alliance.	1	2	1		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	But sales then tumbled to 63,000 tonnes last year.	1	1	2		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	Market and industry players say the currency's appreciation prompted buyers in India, where most of Mozambique's cashews are processed, to search for cheaper options elsewhere.	2	1	1		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	"Prices last year got to all time highs and that really hurts demand," said Richard Rosenblatt, of the Richard Franco Agency, a U.S.-based nut broker.	2	1	2		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	Oil-rich Angola, another former Portuguese colony on the other side of Africa, also highlights the impact of Dutch disease on agriculture.	1	1	1		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	Before independence in 1975 and the chaos of its civil war, Angola was the world's fourth-largest coffee producer, churning out 200,000 tonnes of beans a year.	2	1	2		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	Now, a decade after the fighting ended, it is vying with Nigeria to be Africa's biggest oil producer, while its coffee industry remains in a rut with annual output of a paltry 4,000 tonnes.	1	1	2		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	One solution being explored in Mozambique is to process its cashew nuts at home.	1	1	1		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	"The cashew nut is consumed externally so it is the international price that dictates things," said Filomena Maiopue, director of the National Cashew Institute in the capital, Maputo.	2	1	1		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	"We've reached the conclusion, in discussion with the Ministry of Agriculture, that in order to minimize that effect, we need to intensify local processing," said Maiopue.	3	1	1		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	Even if the government does get its act together, there is little immediate relief in store for farmers as money continues to pour in from mining giants such as Brazil's Vale to develop the Mozambique's vast coal fields.	2	1	1		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	Joaquin Solomon Nhantumo, a farmer in southern Mozambique, has been forced him to grow lettuce and tomatoes in his back-yard orchard to provide for himself and his eight children.	2	1	2		4	
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	But he says there is only one crop that will keep him in business in the long run.	2	1	1		4

401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	With thousands of attendees, campaign staff and reporters -- and all of their smartphones, tablets, laptops and other connected gear -- descending on campus Oct. 11, it takes impressive technology and a coordinated effort to keep the data running smoothly.	2	1	1		4

401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	To give an idea of the challenge, the college's IT crew is expecting approximately 1,500-2,000 wireless-connected devices at any given time, with an average 2.5 wireless devices per attendee -- and that doesn't count the computers and other equipment that calls for a hardline connection.	2	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	It's also, the team admits, an estimation.	2	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	"Bandwidth is a big guess," said Shane Wilson, coordinator of Network Services at Centre College.	2	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	"The only data we have is from 2008, and that's basically ancient history.	2	1	1		4

401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	How is the college preparing to deliver problem-free data connections?	2	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	To make sure there's enough bandwidth to go around, Centre College will be temporarily expanding its Internet connection from 250 megabits to 2 gigabits.	1	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	That's an eightfold increase using two single-gigabit links running simultaneously.	1	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	Mobile providers are also bringing in trucks to help boost the mobile phone and data signals in the immediate area.	1	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	And what about network problems?	2	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	For network engineers concerned about stability during a high-traffic event, redundancy is the name of the game.	2	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	Accordingly, Centre Network worked with several vendors to set up a temporary network that's running separate from the campus network.	1	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	The new network is fully redundant with four routers, multiple backbone links and multiple core paths, giving Centre College's IT staff the ability to quickly adapt is something goes wrong on debate day.	1	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	There's also a power redundancy -- the debate hall is run on a diesel generator, but it can be quickly switched to standard line power if there's a problem (it's quicker to switch from diesel to electric than vice-versa).	2	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	And like a military tanker jet high above a field of combat, diesel gas trucks will be waiting nearby in case they need to refuel.	3	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	And what if something goes wrong on the provider side, like physical damage to fiber?	2	1	2		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	The college's staff will have support cases with CISCO, AT&T and Time Warner Cable open in advance, drastically speeding up any necessary repairs.	2	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	AT&T and Time Warner will also have trained technicians on site, ready to go in case of an emergency -- think of them as network first responders.	1	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	With so many connected devices, security is surely a concern.	3	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	Centre College's staff says they'll be using separate VLAN SSID networks for each of the campaigns as well for the media and other major groups involved with the debate.	1	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	Each network will use encrypted 802.11x to help keep the campaigns from spying on one another's traffic and the media from spying on the campaigns' traffic.	1	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	Will it all work?	2	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	On Thursday afternoon, Centre College invited about 120 faculty, staff and students to help test the network and look for problems.	1	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	A few were found and quickly fixed -- a result that built confidence among the Centre College team.	1	2	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	"We discovered problems and corrected them -- and that was the goal," said Wilson.	2	2	2		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	"I feel much better than if everything had gone smoothly.	3	2	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	If that happened, I would've wondered what was left uncovered."	2	1	1		4	
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	The tech involved in running a nationally-televised debate has drastically changed in the last 12 years, said Art Moore, Centre College's director of information technology services.	2	1	1		4

402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	LONDON (Reuters) - Two former editors of Rupert Murdoch-owned newspapers who had close ties to British Prime Minister David Cameron will face trial late next year at the earliest on charges related to alleged phone-hacking, a court heard on Wednesday.	1	1	2		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson were among 13 suspects who appeared in court, accused either of conspiring to intercept the voicemail messages of more than 600 people or hindering the police investigation into those claims.	1	1	3		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	The hearing - at London's Central Criminal Court, known as the Old Bailey - only dealt with administrative matters, not the substance of the allegations.	1	1	1		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	All 13 suspects heard the proposed date for their trial had been set for September 9, 2013.	1	1	1		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	The hacking scandal has damaged the reputation of Murdoch's global media operations, raised questions about Cameron's judgment and exposed the close relations between British politicians, police and journalists.	2	1	3		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	Brooks and Coulson were both once editors of the News of the World, a Sunday tabloid that Murdoch abruptly shut down in July 2011 because of allegations that some of its journalists had hacked the phones of celebrities, politicians and crime victims.	2	1	3		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	By that time, Brooks had been promoted to chief executive of News International, Murdoch's British newspaper business, and was a confidante to the media mogul and a close friend to successive British prime ministers including Cameron.	2	2	1		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	After leaving the News of the World, Coulson was hired by Cameron, then in opposition, to be his communications chief.	1	1	1		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	Cameron took Coulson into government with him but Coulson later resigned.	1	1	1		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	None of the accused in the hacking case has yet entered a plea though Brooks and Coulson have indicated they will deny the accusations.	2	1	2		5

402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	The dock at the Old Bailey's wood-paneled Court One, where some of Britain's most notorious criminals have gone on trial, was so full that several of the suspects had to sit on adjacent benches.	1	1	2		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	Eighteen lawyers in wigs and black gowns, including some of the country's top defense counsel, looked on.	2	1	1		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	Brooks, instantly recognizable with her mane of long red curls was wearing a beige jacket and spoke only to confirm her presence, as did the other suspects.	1	1	1		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	Joining Coulson and Brooks in the dock were some of the most senior former staff from the News of the World who have been charged with conspiracy to intercept voicemails.	1	1	3		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	Brooks is also charged, with six others, including her husband Charlie, with conspiring to hinder police investigating the alleged phone-hacking by concealing material from them.	1	1	3		5

402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	Tight restrictions were imposed on the reporting of the hearing which decided on a timetable for evidence to be disclosed.	1	1	1		5	
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	The court was told that the next hearing for the cases would be on December 12 and 13.	1	1	1		5

404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	Nadine was born, declared to be over, came back from the dead and just keeps sticking around.	1	1	2	 	4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	And now, the cyclone's longevity will earn it a spot in the record books: By tonight, it will become the Atlantic Ocean's 10th longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).	1	2	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	A tropical cyclone is an organized storm with winds greater than 32 mph (52 kph), and includes tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes.	1	1	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	Nadine is expected to retain tropical cyclone strength for another three to four days, in which case it could become one of the top five longest-lasting cyclones, said Dennis Feltgen, an NHC spokesman.	1	1	2		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	The longest-lasting Atlantic cyclone ever was the San Ciriaco Hurricane of 1899, which hung on for 28 days.	1	1	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	Nadine, which has been a cyclone for 19 days, is not expected to challenge that record, Feltgen told OurAmazingPlanet.	1	1	1		4

404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	Nadine has had an interesting life.	1	2	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	Forecasters issued the first advisory for the storm on the morning of Tuesday, Sept. 11.	1	1	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	Three days later, at 11 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14, the storm became the eighth hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season.	1	1	2		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	Exactly one week later, at 11 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 21, forecasters at the NHC declared that Tropical Storm Nadine was no more.	1	1	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	Yet forecasters suspected the storm wasn't finished, writing that it could regenerate.	1	1	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	And indeed, Nadine did spring back to life like a meteorological zombie, and was declared to be a tropical storm again on Sunday, Sept. 23.	2	1	2		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	On Sept. 28, it was again declared a hurricane.	1	1	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	It weakened because it encountered surface waters cooler than 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius), and ingested colder, drier air, both of which slow down storms and disrupt the convection that fuels them.	1	1	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	But it picked up when it re-encountered warmer waters and began reorganizing, Feltgen said.	2	1	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	It's not unusual for storms to weaken and strengthen again, although it doesn't usually happen this far north.	1	1	1		4

404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	1), Nadine was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, defined as being a rotating, organized storm with maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph).	1	1	1	S	4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	Nadine currently packs maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph) and is churning away about 690 miles (1,110 kilometers) west of the Azores.	1	1	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	It doesn't present any immediate threat to people on land.	1	2	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	Nadine has been a tropical storm for the seventh longest amount of time in the history of the Atlantic Ocean basin, Feltgen said.	1	1	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	The longest-lasting storm in any ocean basin was John, which began life as a hurricane in the East Pacific basin, then moved to the Northwest Pacific and was renamed as a typhoon.	1	1	1		4	
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	That storm survived for 31 days in August and September 1994.	1	1	1		4

405	nasdaq-defends-facebook-compensation-plan-letter-sec-191238322--sector	(Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group Inc stood by its proposed $62 million plan to compensate firms affected by the fallout from Facebook's botched IPO, taking aim at UBS AG, Citigroup Inc and other parties which derided the payback plan.	1	1	1	 	4	
405	nasdaq-defends-facebook-compensation-plan-letter-sec-191238322--sector	In a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated September 17, Nasdaq said the proposed compensation pool "goes well beyond what is required under current Nasdaq rules."	2	2	1		4	
405	nasdaq-defends-facebook-compensation-plan-letter-sec-191238322--sector	It noted that if the proposal is not approved, the applicable limit of liability under the approved rule would instead be $500,000 - less than 1 percent of the proposed pool.	1	1	1		4	
405	nasdaq-defends-facebook-compensation-plan-letter-sec-191238322--sector	Nasdaq's plan to offer $62 million in cash was an increase from an earlier $40 million payback fund, which was made up mostly of trading rebates.	1	1	1		4	
405	nasdaq-defends-facebook-compensation-plan-letter-sec-191238322--sector	Nasdaq defended its use of a 45-minute window to determine a benchmark reference price to assess the amount owed on orders qualifying for accommodation.	2	1	1		4	
405	nasdaq-defends-facebook-compensation-plan-letter-sec-191238322--sector	The company said the time frame "should have been ample time for a reasonably diligent member to identify any unexpected losses or unanticipated positions and take steps to mitigate or liquidate them."	2	1	2		4

407	navy-officer-faked-own-death-affair-132500204	The Navy officer who faked his own death to get out of an affair	1	1	3			
407	navy-officer-faked-own-death-affair-132500204	In August, Navy Cmdr. Michael P. Ward II was given command of his own nuclear submarine — the culmination of a lifelong dream. A week later, he was languishing at a desk job, on his way to an official reprimand for violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice. His offense? Being a really incompetent adulterer, essentially. Ward, a 43-year-old married father, faked his own death to get out of a relationship with his 23-year-old pregnant mistress. Here's the sordid tale of one man's self-defeatingly elaborate plan to end an affair:	2	1	4			
407	navy-officer-faked-own-death-affair-132500204	What do we know about this relationship?According to the Navy's investigation, obtained by the AP Sept. 18 under a Freedom of Information Act request, and the unidentified woman's earlier account in the Connecticut newspaper The Day, Ward (then a Virginia resident) met his lover through an online dating site last October. He initially used the alias Tony Moore, then told her his real name once they met; he claimed he and his wife were separated. He and this new girlfriend hooked up during a visit near her Norfolk, Va., home, and Ward got her pregnant. In July, after he had moved to Connecticut, they met in Washington to discuss the pregnancy. The woman then lost the baby. And then, Ward suddenly "died."	1	1	4			
407	navy-officer-faked-own-death-affair-132500204	SEE ALSO: Good day, bad day: September 17, 2012				I		
407	navy-officer-faked-own-death-affair-132500204	How did he fake his death?Over email. Using his own account, but posing as a colleague named "Bob," Ward wrote: "He asked me to contact you if this ever happened. I am extremely sorry to tell you that he is gone. We tried everything we could to save him. I cannot say more. I am sorry it has to be this way."	1	1	4			
407	navy-officer-faked-own-death-affair-132500204	And how did he get caught?The woman, with her mother and sister in tow, drove three-and-a-half hours to Ward's Virginia home to offer their condolences. Instead of a grieving family, they found Jon Boyle, the new owner of the Wards' house. "She was very surprised," Boyle tells the AP. "They said they wanted to offer their condolences. I said, 'I don't think he's dead.'" A relative of the mistress then contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. "I don't want revenge here," the woman told The Day in August. "I want everyone to know the truth about Michael. He does not need to be commanding a submarine. He's a deceitful man." On Sept. 5, Ward was slapped with three violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.	3	2	4			
407	navy-officer-faked-own-death-affair-132500204	SEE ALSO: Petty in pink				I		
407	navy-officer-faked-own-death-affair-132500204	Is this a fireable offense?Yes. Adultery, not to mention being a jerk — or, in military code, engaging in "conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman" — violate military rules. "The Navy doesn't kid around with its leadership," Rep. Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) tells the AP. "These positions, to command submarines, are very competitive and I think the Navy is right to hold people to the highest standard." Besides, says Nicole Fabian-Weber at The Stir, he sounds like a spineless idiot. Would you really want to put your multimillion-dollar attack sub, much less your life, in the hands of a man undone by his lack of courage to tell his mistress "he just wasn't that into her"?	4	3	5

414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	NFL kickers are off to their best start ever	2	3	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	DENVER (AP) — The men in stripes have drawn so much attention this season that some interesting developments on the football field have gone largely unnoticed, like a big spike in field goal accuracy.	2	2	2		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	NFL teams combined for a record 2,287 points in the first three weeks of the season thanks to a record 248 touchdowns.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Kickers have done their part in this proliferation of points, converting 182 field goal attempts and missing just 15 for a 92.4 percent clip — the best three-week start ever.	2	3	2		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	The three-week mark tends to be a precursor for the entire season, with the final accuracy rate dipping two or three percentage points as the weather gets worse and the pressure rises.	2	2	2		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	That means the record set in 2008 of 84.5 percent could be obliterated this season.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	The league-wide field goal percentage last season was 82.9 percent, second-highest all-time.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Through three weeks last season, the number was 85.8 percent, according to STATS LLC.	1	1	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	If this year's figure drops a similar 2.9 percentage points, it would end up at 89.5 percent, an enormous jump, statistically speaking.	2	2	2		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Denver Broncos kicker Matt Prater, the most accurate kicker in league history from 50 yards and out, said he thinks this year's spike is the culmination of several factors ranging from better athletes to improved coaching and superior training.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"Guys are just getting better and better," Prater said.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"You get guys who are veterans in there and they learn from their mistakes and don't want to repeat them."	2	2	2		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Yet, it's not just the icy veined veterans who are nailing their kicks.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Kickers coming out of college are having immediate success, too, much like the better-prepared rookie quarterbacks who no longer have to bide their time as backups.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Heading into this weekend's slate beginning with Thursday night's Cleveland-Baltimore game, the Ravens' Justin Tucker, St. Louis' Greg Zuerlein and Minnesota's Blair Walsh were a combined 22-for-22 with each rookie having kicked at least a 55-yarder.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Tucker and Walsh have game-winners already.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Tucker's beat New England 31-30 last weekend as time expired and Walsh's came in overtime against Jacksonville after he kicked a 55-yarder as time expired in regulation.	1	2	2		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"There's more camps for kids coming up the ranks now," Prater said.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"You can get a good head start on it."	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	During their high school years, both Walsh and Tucker attended kicking camps in California run by Chris Sailer, who kicked for UCLA in the 1990s.	1	1	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Kickers are also in the weight room more, employ specialized training and superior techniques, kick on more favorable surfaces, generally are better coached and are used more effectively and efficiently on game day.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	They benefit from better athleticism than their predecessors, come almost exclusively from soccer backgrounds, are aided by an increased emphasis on special teams and rule changes, and even by playing some of their games indoors.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	It all adds up to greater accuracy.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"Coaches are starting to let more opportunities happen, which will increase the percentage," Walsh said.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"I just think guys are really starting to perfect what they do, and you're seeing a lot more great kickers today than you probably did in the past.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	You'd have a handful of great kickers and the rest would be pretty good, but not elite, but I think there's a ton of elite kickers in the NFL right now."	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	The success rate has risen steadily from all distances, short and long, during the Super Bowl era.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	In 1967, for instance, barely 51 percent of all field goal attempts were good.	2	1	2		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Now, nine in 10 are splitting the uprights, which were moved to the back of the end zone in 1974.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Back then, kickers were often converted linemen who happened to have strong legs.	2	1	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Now, every kicker in the NFL played soccer as a kid and all employ the soccer-style kick that has improved place-kickers' accuracy over the decades.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Hall of Fame kicker Lou "The Toe" Groza made 54.9 percent of his field goal attempts, a percentage that would get him run off the roster today, not enshrined in Canton, Ohio.	2	2	2		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Kickers aren't just more accurate, but with such parity in the league, they're more important than ever.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Through Week 3, 28 games were decided by one score, tied with 1988 for the most such games through the first three weeks.	1	1	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Last weekend, seven games were decided in the final minute of regulation or overtime, something that's happened just once before, in 1995.	1	1	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Five of those came down to a field goal.	1	1	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Among the seven game-winning field goals so far was Tucker's 27-yarder as time expired that gave the Ravens the victory over the New England Patriots last weekend in a rematch of the AFC championship game.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	In that title game, Billy Cundiff missed a 32-yard field goal in the closing seconds.	1	1	2		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	In the encore, Tucker — who took the job away from Cundiff in training camp — drove his kick just inside the right upright.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"Bottom line is it went in," Tucker said.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"That's all I care about.	2	1	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	It went in."	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Patriots coach Bill Belichick wasn't so sure and he was fined $50,000 this week for grabbing a replacement official's arm after the game as he tried to see if the call was reviewable.	2	1	2		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	It wasn't.	1	1	2		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Tucker, who beat out Cundiff with a perfect preseason, attributes his success to lessons he received from head coach John Harbaugh, special teams coach Jerry Rosburg and kicking consultant Randy Brown.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"I feel like I'm kicking the best I ever kicked," Tucker said.	3	3	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"Took a little work, took a couple of days, and now I feel like I'm striking the ball as confidently as I ever have."	3	3	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	He's not the only one who feels that way.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Prater's three field goals against Houston last week moved him past Jason Elam as the most accurate kicker in team history at 81 percent, and his 53-yarder made him 13 for 17 from 50 yards and out for a 76.5 percent clip, the best in league history with a minimum of 10 attempts.	1	3	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Ryan Succop's club-record sixth field goal gave Kansas City a 27-24 win in overtime at New Orleans last weekend.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	He was a perfect 6 for 6 on kicks ranging from 25 to 45 yards.	1	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Zuerlein, a sixth-round pick out of tiny Missouri Western, is 8 for 8 on field goals, including a 56-yarder last week, one yard shy of the Rams franchise record.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	What impresses his coaches is his steely resolve that belies his inexperience.	3	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"I guess I'm just confident in my abilities," Zuerlein said.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"I expect to make the kick, so I don't get nervous really."	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Rams special teams coach John Fassel said he's never worked with a kicker this talented so early in his career: "You see him in the mall, he looks like any other 24-year-old walking around," Fassel said.	2	3	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"But his leg speed is incredible."	2	3	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	Zuerlein said years spent playing soccer probably account for his explosive leg power, not anything he does in the weight room.	2	2	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"I can't squat a house or anything like that," Zuerlein said.	2	1	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	"It's probably about the same amount of weight just an average person might lift."	2	1	1		4	
414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	So far this season, there's been nothing ordinary about NFL kickers.	2	2	1		4

415	nfl-referee-lockout-huge-win-organized-labor-160500722	The NFL referee lockout: A huge win for organized labor?	3	3	1			
415	nfl-referee-lockout-huge-win-organized-labor-160500722	Following a heinous game-ending call that handed the Seattle Seahawks a victory over the Green Bay Packers on Monday night, everyone seems to agree that the NFL has to resolve a labor dispute with the referees' union that has kept the regular refs on the sidelines. Even President Obama tweeted that "NFL fans on both sides of the aisle hop the refs' lockout is settled soon," while GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin native, is fuming about it on the campaign trail. But perhaps the most surprising response came from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who is famous for trying to repeal collective bargaining rights of public unions in his state. Walker tweeted that the Packers game was "painful," and practically begged for the real refs to return, which sounded an awful lot like a pro-union statement. Has the controversy been a boon for organized labor?	4	3	4			
415	nfl-referee-lockout-huge-win-organized-labor-160500722	Yes. It obliterates union stereotypes: "The NFL referee lockout is turning into a gigantic advertisement for organized labor," says Jonathan Chait at New York. "Conservatives have spent decades successfully associating labor unions with laziness and shoddy work," and the bungling of the replacement refs, "broadcast into tens of millions of living rooms," is empathic evidence to the contrary. The lockout could potentially be a "seminal event" in how Americans view union employees. "Scott Walker, Packer fan, now a union man"	4	3	4			
415	nfl-referee-lockout-huge-win-organized-labor-160500722	And it bolsters other unions' claims: "Never before has so much media attention been paid to a labor dispute involving so few actual laborers— the 120 NFL referees," says Karl Taro Greenfeld at Bloomberg Businessweek. But the controversy also "reflects a larger trend in the American workplace." In addition to a dispute over pensions, the referees' union is rejecting a strict performance metric that is similar to a recent proposal to evaluate Chicago teachers on student test scores. Both the refs and teachers say such rigid proposals fail to take their work environment into account, and the replacement refs controversy may show that "officiating, like teaching, is as much art as science." "The NFL fiasco: Why referees are like Chicago teachers"	2	2	3			
415	nfl-referee-lockout-huge-win-organized-labor-160500722	This is actually an area of bipartisan agreement: Walker has previously said he "has no beef with private-sector unions," and in this case, he just seems to be advocating a "more conciliatory approach," says David A. Graham at The Atlantic. The most important thing is "to get the unionized refs back on the field," and "on that, at least, Wisconsites should be able to find bipartisan agreement."

417	niger-reduce-fuel-prices-china-loan-rate-cut-153752961--finance	NIAMEY (Reuters) - Niger will reduce the cost of fuel at the pumps by about 7 percent next year as a result of China cutting the interest rate on a loan taken out to pay for the West African country's sole oil refinery, the oil minister said on state television.	2	2	1		5	
417	niger-reduce-fuel-prices-china-loan-rate-cut-153752961--finance	The move will curb the threat of further social unrest in the West African state, where riots over fuel prices have cost at least two lives this year.	2	1	3		5

417	niger-reduce-fuel-prices-china-loan-rate-cut-153752961--finance	The retail price is currently 579 CFA francs per litre.	1	1	1		5

421	nigerias-boko-haram-says-no-peace-talks-spokesman-053318248	KANO, Nigeria (Reuters) - The purported leader of Boko Haram, the Islamist sect in Nigeria, has denied government statements the group is involved in peace talks and has said its spokesman Abu Qaqa has been captured by security forces.	2	1	2		4	
421	nigerias-boko-haram-says-no-peace-talks-spokesman-053318248	Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has said the authorities were in dialogue with Boko Haram via back channels and that this was helping neutralise the threat the sect posed.	2	2	2		4	
421	nigerias-boko-haram-says-no-peace-talks-spokesman-053318248	But Abubakar Shekau, the group's leader, said in a video posted on YouTube on Sunday that no such talks were going on.	2	1	1		4

421	nigerias-boko-haram-says-no-peace-talks-spokesman-053318248	It has been blamed for more than 1,000 deaths since its insurgency - which is aimed at carving out an Islamic state in northern Nigeria - intensified in 2010.	2	1	4		4	
421	nigerias-boko-haram-says-no-peace-talks-spokesman-053318248	Shekau also said the sect's spokesman was being detained by the security forces.	2	1	2		4

421	nigerias-boko-haram-says-no-peace-talks-spokesman-053318248	It was the first public statement on the matter by the militants since a raid, which it says led to Qaqa's arrest but not his death.	2	1	2		4

423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Bond's world of cars, casinos and caviar was sexy, luxurious and colorful.	3	3	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Instead of a gray, shadowy figure, here was spy as glamorous jet-setter.	3	3	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	The films turned Cold War anxiety into a thrill-ride from which the good guy always emerged triumphant.	3	3	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	"There had been nothing like it before," said Graham Rye, editor of 007 magazine, who remembers being blown away by the film as an 11-year-old.	3	5	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	"A lot of British films at the time were austere, black-and-white, kitchen-sink dramas.	3	1	3

423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	No' exploded onto the screen, it had a pretty visceral effect on everybody."	3	3	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Since then, Bond has survived showdowns with enemies from uber-villain Ernst Blofeld to steel-toothed assassin Jaws.	3	3	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Even more impressively, he has weathered the social revolution of the 1960s, financial woes and lawsuits, multiple changes of lead actor, the end of the Cold War and the dawn of the War on Terror.	3	4	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	His survival is the result of chemistry, tenacity and luck.	3	4	1

423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	No" received mixed reviews — some positive, others dismissive.	3	2	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	"Pure, escapist bunk," sniffed Bosley Crowther of the New York Times.	4	1	3			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	But audiences responded, and "From Russia With Love," released the next year, was also a hit.	2	3	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	By 1964's "Goldfinger," Bond was a phenomenon.	3	5	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	From the start, success was enhanced by clever marketing.	3	3	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	We may think of product placement and merchandising as recent strategies — Daniel Craig's Bond diverges from his martini habit to drink Heineken — but it was part of the package starting with the books, in which Bond's watch is a Rolex, his shampoo Pinaud Elixir.	2	2	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	What began as Fleming's way of demonstrating his character's expensive tastes quickly became a commercial arrangement, now worth millions to the films' producers.	3	3	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	In the '60s, Bond fans could wear 007 deodorant and aftershave or sport James Bond swimming trunks, complete with logo.	2	2	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Connery's Bond drank Smirnoff vodka, while the villain in "Goldfinger" played golf with Slazenger balls.	1	1	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	More than movies, these were experiences in which key elements were established, expected and anticipated.	2	2	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	The locations that spanned the globe and headed into outer space; the gravity-defying stunt sequences; the rocket belts, car-submarines and other gadgets; the megalomaniacal villains and their sadistic henchmen — all quickly became part of the Bond brand.	2	3	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	So did the theme songs, many of them performed by the biggest artists of the day, from Paul McCartney ("Live and Let Die") to Madonna ("Die Another Day").	2	3	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	And, of course, there were the "Bond girls," characters who are victims or villains but always fatefully — and often fatally — attracted to 007.	2	3	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Bond's scantily clad female companions have long provided ammunition for critics, who accuse the films of sexism, though others argue that the films offer eye-candy for everyone: Ursula Andress in a bikini, but also Daniel Craig in his tight blue swim trunks.	3	2	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Anticipating new tweaks on the familiar elements became part of the films' appeal, rendering them both instantly recognizable and eminently spoofable, as Mike Myers' pitch-perfect Austin Powers movies proved.	2	3	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	The films' producers at EON Productions — today run by Cubby Broccoli's daughter and stepson, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson — have become expert at honing the formula.	2	3	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	They are masters of suspense, drip-feeding details about each new film — title, locations, guest stars — to eager fans.	3	4	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Like its hero, the series has had many near-death experiences.	2	1	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Connery quit acrimoniously after six films.	3	1	3			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	There was a long-running legal battle with screenwriter Kevin McClory over rights to the "Thunderball" script.	3	1	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	The result was the unofficial Bond film "Never Say Never Again," which saw 52-year-old Connery return after a decade away from the role.	1	2	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Former model George Lazenby lasted just a single film — "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" from 1969, a dark-hued tale that ranks among many fans' favorites.	2	2	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Moore took Bond in a lighter direction during the 1970s.	1	1	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Audiences didn't warm to Timothy Dalton's tougher, meaner 1980s Bond, but Pierce Brosnan's suave superagent — circling the globe in ever more futuristic vehicles, including an invisible car— fit with the optimistic post-Cold War era.	3	3	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Just as 007's clothes have evolved with changing fashions — from Connery's lean '60s suits to Moore's flares to Craig's Tom Ford formalwear — producers have tried to find Bonds to mirror the mood of the times.	2	2	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	The aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks brought a change of tone.	2	1	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Craig's Bond, who made his debut in "Casino Royale" in 2006, is a darker, tougher spy who harkens back to Fleming's original, restoring sadism and self-loathing to Bond's emotional arsenal.	3	2	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Although the Broccoli family won't comment, media reports say Craig has committed to two more films after "Skyfall," with Bond 24 due for release in 2014 or 2015 — that is, if 007 continues to cheat death.	3	2	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	The most recent threat to Bond was a production delay on "Skyfall" when studio MGM filed for bankruptcy in 2010.	2	1	2			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	But Agent 007 is in pretty good shape for 50.	2	2	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Will he last another half century?	2	2	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	Rye, the magazine editor, thinks so.	3	2	1			
423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	"Bond, like diamonds, is forever," he said.	4	4	1

424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - It might be hard to believe there are more pressure-packed moments in golf than standing over a four-foot putt to win a tournament and pocket a $1 million cheque.	2	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	But almost to a man, members of the United States and European Ryder Cup teams who will battle at Medinah Country Club this week insist that barely gets the pulse racing compared to the heart-thumping pressure when playing for national pride.	2	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	All 12 members of each side have won tournaments around the world, some have slipped into green jackets after winning the Masters while others hoisted the Claret Jug after British Open triumphs, but nothing compares to the thrill and heartbreak that accompanies every Ryder Cup.	3	1	2		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	Two years ago at Celtic Manor Graeme McDowell rolled in a 12-footer on the 16th green that secured Europe's margin of victory, the Northern Irishman mobbed by team mates and a euphoric crowd one hole later as his opponent, American Hunter Mahan, was left crushed.	3	2	2		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	In the aftermath of Europe's victory, McDowell described his U.S. Open win earlier that year to a back nine stroll with his dad compared to the weighty burden he felt that day.	2	1	2		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	"I can safely say that I don't think I can ever be more nervous on a golf course than I was that day for those last seven holes," McDowell recalled on Tuesday, the first day of official practice for this week's Ryder Cup.	2	1	2		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	"You're just trying not to mess up.	2	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	You're trying not to lose it for your team mates.	2	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	... Coming down the stretch that day was some of the toughest golf I had ever played in my life."	3	1	2		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	The Ryder Cup's team concept is a foreign but strangely alluring concept to most golfers who otherwise spend their careers focused on their own performance and bank accounts.	3	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	But this week 24 of the world's best players will not pocket a penny for the opportunity to put themselves through an emotional meat grinder.	4	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	At a tournament, if a golfer fails to make the cut, he has only to answer to himself.	1	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	At the Ryder Cup players must deal with the unfamiliar responsibility of holding up their end and carrying the flag for their respective nations.	2	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	"For us to represent the United States of America and our team mates, it's something else," said Tiger Woods, who is taking part in his seventh Ryder Cup.	1	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	"When it gets to a certain point, either Friday afternoon, late in the evening, or Saturday late in the evening, and all the teams are gathered and there's like one group out there, and if you happen to be in that group, it's interesting.	2	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	"It's so much heat on you.	2	2	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	"It's different than playing by yourself.	1	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	Playing for team mates, it just adds an element that it means so much more because it is our country and it is our team mates."	2	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	GUT-CHURNING INTENSITY	1	1	2		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	The Ryder Cup generates the type of gut-churning intensity that can cause even golfers with the strongest knees to buckle.	3	1	2		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	Each Ryder Cup produces moments of truth that will test a player's nerve and in some cases define careers.	3	1	1		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	At Kiawah Island in 1991, known in Ryder Cup lore as "The War at the Shore," Mark Calcavecchia suffered one of the biennial event's great collapses.	2	1	2		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	Four-up with four holes to play against Colin Montgomerie, Calcavecchia stumbled and allowed the Scotsman to escape with a half-point.	2	1	2		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	A disconsolate Calcavecchia walked off the 18th green to the beach where he shed a few tears but the U.S. was able to end the day in celebration when Germany's Bernhard Langer, one of golf's coolest customers, missed a short putt on his final hole to hand the Americans a 14 1/2-13 1/2 victory.	2	2	2		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	Experience will help defuse some of the anxiety but there is no escaping the pressure that has come to characterise the Ryder Cup.	2	2	2		4	
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	"Experience is a big key this week, just knowing what to expect I suppose," said McDowell.	2	1	1		4

425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	Norwegian mass killer's speech to hit German theatre	2	2	2		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	BERLIN (Reuters) - A Turkish-German actress will read out Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik's bizarre courtroom speech in German theatres next month in an effort to highlight the widespread prevalence of far-right ideology in Europe.	2	2	2		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	Swiss director Milo Rau adapted the script of "Breivik's Explanation" for the German stage from an audio recording of the hour-long speech the far-right nationalist gave in April before being sentenced by an Oslo court to 21 years in prison for killing 77 people last year.	2	2	2		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	Though Breivik's talk of an international underground of killers - latter-day Crusaders he called the Knights Templar - seemed to be mere fantasy, many of his beliefs are to be found within the fold of anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant populists.	2	1	3		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	"His ideological `manifesto' is a distilled representation of a cultural crisis that pervades the European continent and finds expression in an increasingly xenophobic populism," Kirsten Simonsen, a professor at Denmark's Roskilde University, wrote in "Bloodlands", a 2012 series of essays about Breivik.	1	1	2		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	Some notions touched on by Breivik in his justification for setting off a bomb in Oslo and shooting dozens of teenagers dead on an island retreat - that Europe and its indigenous cultures are being weakened by immigration and multiculturalism - have been helping reshape right-wing continental politics for years.	1	1	3		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	The theatre performances in Weimar and Berlin are intended to promote the view that while Breivik's actions were those of a madman, the ideology that drove him is shockingly widespread in democratic societies like Switzerland and Germany, the 35-year-old director told Reuters.	2	1	2		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	"It's merely a coincidence that Breivik was the one saying it," Rau said.	1	2	1		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	"His words could just as well have come from 60 percent of the Swiss population."	1	1	1		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	Citing the language of far-right Swiss nationalists who enjoy wide support in his country, Rau added that issues such as a referendum banning the construction of minarets in Switzerland exposed the parallels between Breivik's hate speech and the xenophobia in European society.	2	1	2		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	Breivik's words will merely be read rather than dramatised and there will be no courtroom scene, Rau said.	1	2	1		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	Turkish-German actress Sascha Soydan was chosen to distance the Breivik "character" and his actions from the ideology that drove him.	2	2	1		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	"It's not a good speech and it doesn't make for good theatre either," Rau said.	1	1	2		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	"I want to show a text and an ideology, I don't want to depict the person behind them - that's why I opted for this extremely unauthentic portrayal and very dry way of doing it."	1	2	1		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	Only snippets of Breivik's speech were ever made public during the proceedings in April because judges thought publishing it in its entirety would only provide Breivik with a platform for his xenophobic views.	1	1	2		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	"There's a reason the speech wasn't allowed to leave the courtroom - so that no one tinkers around with it and makes it seem better than it was," Rau said.	1	1	2		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	Performances are scheduled to take place in Weimar on October 19 and in Berlin on October 27.	1	1	1		3	
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	A panel discussion will follow both performances.	1	1	1		3

427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	That's more than a percentage point lower than the growth in each of the past two years, and the smallest increase since 2009 when sales were up just 0.3 percent.	1	1	2		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	The projections are an important indicator for retailers that depend on the last two months of the year for up to 40 percent of their annual sales.	1	1	1		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	But the estimates also offer valuable insight for economists who closely watch consumer spending, which accounts for up to 70 percent of economic activity.	1	1	1		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	The holiday shopping season is one gauge of not only the shopping habits, but also the mindset of the average American during what has turned out to be a slow and uneven economic recovery.	2	1	2		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	Right now, people are feeling better about rising home prices and a rebounding stock market, but job growth is still weak and prices for everything from food to gas are higher.	2	2	2		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	At the same time, there's uncertainty about who the next president will be and some Americans worry that the U.S. debt crisis could lead to another recession.	3	1	2		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	"In all the years, this is the most challenging year doing a forecast," said Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the National Retail Federation, based in Washington, D.C. "There are so many uncertainties."	2	1	2		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	No one's feeling those uncertainties more than U.S. shoppers.	3	1	1		2

427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	Still, Johnson, who's been grappling with higher food and gas prices, says the economy is still not stable enough for her to splurge during this holiday shopping season.	3	1	2		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	And she's worried about how the debt crisis could affect her.	2	1	2		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	Johnson says last year, she overindulged and spent about $5,000.	3	1	1		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	It took until this past May to pay down her credit card debt.	1	1	1		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	As a result, this year, she plans to cut her holiday spending to $1,500.	1	1	1		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	"I felt too much pressure financially," said Johnson, who works for the National Institutes of Health, a government agency that's a conglomerate of research centers.	1	1	1		2

427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	It's Americans' worries about the economic uncertainty that led the National Retail Federation to predict slower growth during the winter holiday shopping season than the increase of 5.6 percent and 5.5 percent in 2010 and 2011, respectively.	1	1	2		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	Still, the forecast is higher than the average growth of 3.5 percent for November and December over the past 10 years.	1	2	1		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	And it continues a growth trend that began after holiday sales fell 4.4 percent in 2008 during the middle of the recession.	1	2	2		2

427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	The federation's forecast also is still more optimistic than the International Council of Shopping Centers, a mall trade group that last week said it predicts a 2.9 percent increase.	1	3	1		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	It's also higher than the 3.3 percent growth estimated by ShopperTrak, a Chicago-based analyzer of retail foot traffic, last month.	1	2	1		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	The forecasts come as retailers wrap up what's expected to be a strong back-to-school shopping season.	2	2	1		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	There have been no official numbers out on sales for that shopping period, which is typically the second biggest shopping season of the year and a barometer for what people are willing to spend during the winter holidays.	2	1	1		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	But Ken Perkins, president of RetailMetrics LLC, said he expects revenue at stores opened at least a year to be up 5 percent for the combined August and September months.	2	2	1		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	But predicting holiday spending is never easy.	2	1	1		2

427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	Overall sales were strong, but sales don't tell the whole story: Retailers' profits were eroded because they had to do a lot of discounting to get shoppers to spend, particularly during the final weeks before Christmas.	2	2	2		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	And all the economic variables that will likely have an impact on this year's shopping season make predicting sales that much more difficult.	2	1	2		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	Among them, the worry that the U.S. economy will fall off into another recession next year.	1	1	3		2

427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	Confidence has been bouncing around since the recession and the current level is still well below what's considered healthy.	2	1	2		2	
427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	Moreover, the spike in confidence has yet to translate into a surge in spending.	2	1	1		2

427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	That's well above the 324,900 hired during the financial meltdown in 2008, but still below the 746,800 level in pre-recession 2006, and well under the nearly 850,000 seasonal workers hired during the height of the dot.com boom in 1999.	1	2	2		2

428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Republican state senator whose vote was crucial to legalizing gay marriage in New York has lost his primary election while a Senate colleague who also broke with the party's stance against same-sex unions narrowly escaped defeat.	2	1	2		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	Senators Roy McDonald and Stephen Saland were among four New York Senate Republicans to cast key votes last year to make New York the most populous U.S. state to allow homosexual marriages.	2	2	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	After a count of absentee ballots, McDonald was determined to have lost his race while Saland narrowly won in September 13 primary elections.	2	2	2		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	Mark Grisanti, another Republican senator who backed the gay marriage measure, which passed New York's Republican-controlled Senate on a 33-29 vote in June 2011, won his primary race by a clear margin.	1	1	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	A fourth senator who supported the bill was not seeking re-election.	1	1	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	McDonald lost the Republican nomination in the 43rd District to Kathy Marchione, the Saratoga County clerk, in a contest that frequently touched on the issue of gay marriage.	1	1	2		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	Although the results are yet to be certified, Marchione had a lead of about 110 votes after a final count of absentee ballots, according to her campaign and The Saratogian newspaper.	2	2	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	About 50 votes still were awaiting adjudication by a judge.	1	1	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	"Senator McDonald's vote on marriage was certainly on the minds of voters but they took even greater issue with the fact that he was telling people he would vote a certain way up to a week prior and then voted differently," said Ken Girardin, a spokesman for the Marchione campaign.	2	1	2		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	A McDonald spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.	1	1	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	Saland of Poughkeepsie and Grisanti of Buffalo have retained their party's support following the primaries.	1	1	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	Saland's victory was not secured until Monday after a final tally of absentee ballots gave him a lead of a little more than 100 votes.	1	2	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	The New York primary races were being closely watched as a measure of the tolerance Republican voters might have for candidates who deviate from the official party line, which defines marriage as being between "one man and one woman."	1	1	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	Lawmakers in Rhode Island, Delaware and elsewhere are expected to weigh gay marriage legislation next year and some Republican backing could be needed to pass those measures.	1	1	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	And this November, voters in four states - Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington - will decide ballot initiatives on the issue.	1	1	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	Same-sex marriage has been legalized in seven states and the District of Columbia.	1	2	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	But the outcomes of the New York primaries were close enough that both opponents and supporters of same-sex marriage were able to find encouragement in the results on Tuesday.	1	1	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	Jason McGuire, the executive director of New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms, an evangelical Christian organization that lobbies against same-sex marriage, said Marchione's victory and even Saland's narrow win should be seen as a warning to Republican legislators tempted to "go rogue," as he put it.	2	1	2		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	"The fact that she came from behind with so little support shows that no amount of activist dollars can protect you from an angry electorate," he said of Marchione's victory.	2	1	2		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	But Lynn Faria, the interim executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda, which has lobbied in support of same-sex marriage, said Marchione's narrow win showed many Republicans are willing to back candidates who support gay unions.	2	2	1		4	
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	"Now that we finally know the unofficial results of our state's primary elections, even some among the most conservative of New York voters have sent a clear message that they will support elected officials who stood on the right side of history in June 2011," she said in a statement.	2	2	1		4

431	nyc-worlds-largest-ferris-wheel-171830672	The $230 million attraction, to be called the New York Wheel, is to grace a spot overlooking the Statue of Liberty, New York Harbor and the downtown Manhattan skyline — a singular view that officials hope will add to the appeal what they say would be the world's tallest Ferris wheel.	2	3	1		4	
431	nyc-worlds-largest-ferris-wheel-171830672	The 625-foot-tall structure would swing higher than the Singapore Flyer, the London Eye, and a "High Roller" wheel planned in Las Vegas.	1	2	1		4

431	nyc-worlds-largest-ferris-wheel-171830672	The grand opening could come by the end of 2015.	1	1	1		4

432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	NEW YORK (AP) — Police investigating two gangs called the Very Cripsy Gangsters and the Rockstarz didn't need to spend all their time pounding the pavement for leads. Instead, they fired up their computers and followed the trash talk on Facebook.	3	2	2			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	"Rockstarz up 3-0," one suspect boasted — a reference to the body count from a bloody turf war between the Brooklyn gangs that ultimately resulted in 49 arrests last month.	2	1	4			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	Authorities in New York say a new generation of gang members is increasingly using social media to boast of their exploits and issue taunts and challenges that result in violence. And police and prosecutors have responded over the past several years by closely monitoring Facebook and other sites for leads and evidence.	1	2	4			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	On Tuesday, New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced plans to beef up the NYPD's cyber crackdown by expanding the use of aggressive online investigative tactics and doubling the size of the department's gang unit to 300 investigators.	3	3	2			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	The reinforcements will focus less on established gangs like the Bloods and Crips and more on loosely knit groups of teenagers who stake out a certain block or section of a housing project as their turf and exact vengeance on those who trespass or fail to show the proper respect.	1	1	3			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	"By capitalizing on the irresistible urge of these suspects to brag about their murderous exploits on Facebook, detectives used social media to draw a virtual map of their criminal activity over the last three years," the commissioner said in remarks prepared for delivery at a law enforcement convention in San Diego.	3	2	4			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	Examples of the public displays of digital bravado abound. In the Brooklyn case, suspects sought to intimidate informants by posting court documents containing their names, authorities said. In another throwdown, the Rockstarz posted a photo of a Very Crispy member and the comment, "He is scared. Look at him."	1	1	3			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	Police say much of the potentially incriminating material they gather can be found on Facebook profiles that are public.	1	1	2			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	But as part its new, stepped-up efforts, the department will refine and expand use of a tactic instrumental in the three-year Brooklyn gang investigation — having officers adopt Internet aliases, create phony profiles and seek to "friend" suspects to gain access to nonpublic information, officials said.	2	2	1			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	It's an effort that should be closely regulated, said Christopher Dunn, associate legal director for the New York Civil Liberties Union.	1	1	1			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	"Electronic undercover work is fine," Dunn said. "But we worry about the ease with which the police can use deceit on the Internet to monitor private communications."	1	2	3			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	Police and prosecutors insist they are following strict legal protocols.	1	2	1			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	"When we meet with the police and we talk about investigative techniques, when they are on these social media sites, we'll give them certain directions," Ed Carroll, head of the Gang Bureau of the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, said Tuesday. "We don't want to set up any situation where anyone is being entrapped or put in a position where they're going to agree to commit a crime."	1	2	4			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	In Chicago, police similarly monitor Facebook and other social media to learn what gang members are saying about shootings and other crimes. They also built a database of the city's gang members and provide commanders with software that allows them to send officers to spots where they expect a gang to retaliate for a shooting.	1	2	3			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	A federal judge in New York has already weighed in on the privacy issue, siding with prosecutors in a gang case in the Bronx.	1	1	1			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	In that case, federal investigators infiltrated the private Facebook posts of a suspected leader of a drug crew leader by using the account of a "friend" who became an informant. Court papers says the posts included comments about cocaine deals such as, "I'm trying to see the man for like 600 grams," and photos of the suspect making gang hand gestures.	1	1	3			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	Defense attorneys tried to have the material thrown out, arguing it was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure.	1	1	4			
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	In a decision last month, U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley wrote that defendant Melvin Colon's "legitimate expectation of privacy ended when he disseminated posts to his 'friends' because those 'friends' were free to use the information however they wanted — including sharing it with the government."	2	1	2

433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	Two new independent studies of health insurance premiums and health care spending indicate both are rising at an accelerated pace, despite President Obama's 2008 promise to contain those costs and his pledge that his health care legislation would reduce premiums.	1	1	3		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	Spending on health care surged 4.6 percent in 2011 - up $4,500 per person, on average - according to the nonpartisan Health Care Cost Institute.	1	1	3		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	That's up from a 3.8 growth rate in 2010.	1	1	1		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	Health insurance premiums for individuals and families also climbed year-over-year, up 3 percent ($186) on average for an individual and 4 percent ($672) on average for a family, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.	1	1	3		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	During Obama's term, between 2009 to 2012, premiums have climbed $2,370 for the average family with an employer-provided plan - a rate faster than the during the previous four years under President George W. Bush, according to Kaiser.	1	1	3		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	Experts point to rising health care costs as the driver of increased individual spending and higher premiums.	1	1	2		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	During the 2008 campaign and health care reform debate in 2009, President Obama said repeatedly that his plan would bend the cost curve downward, ultimately saving the average family $2,500 per year.	2	3	1		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	At a rally in Virginia in June 2008, Obama said: "In an Obama administration, we'll lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year."	1	3	1		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	"We'll do it by investing in disease prevention, not just disease management; by investing in a paperless health care system to reduce administrative costs; and by covering every single American and making sure that they can take their health care with them if they lose their job," he said at the time.	1	3	2		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	"We'll also reduce costs for business and their workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses.	2	2	2		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	"We won't do all this twenty years from now, or ten years from now," he said.	2	1	1		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	"We'll do it by the end of my first term as President of the United States."	2	2	1		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	And in a debate with Sen. John McCain in October 2008: "The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.	2	3	1		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year," he said.	2	3	1		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	Obama and Democrats enacted the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a.	2	2	1	S	4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	"Obamacare," in March 2010, including many of the projected cost-saving measures that were hailed before voters.	2	2	1	S	4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	Many of those cost-savings have yet to be realized.	2	1	2		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	President Obama explained in response to a question from ABC News at a Sept. 2010 press conference that "bending the cost curve on health care is hard to do."	3	1	3		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	"I said at the time, it wasn't going to happen tomorrow, it wasn't going to happen next year.	2	1	1		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	It took us decades to get into a position where our health care costs were going up 6, 7, 10 percent a year.	1	2	2		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	And so our goal is to slowly bring down those costs," he said.	2	2	2		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	Obama added, "as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care, at the margins, that's going to increase our costs, we knew that.	2	1	2		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	We didn't think that we were going to cover 30 million people for free, but that the long-term trend in terms of how much the average family is going to be paying for health insurance is going to be improved as a consequence of health care."	2	2	2		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	Last year, I asked White House deputy chief of staff Nancy-Ann DeParle about that $2,500 in savings the president pledged.	1	1	1		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	She insisted families will see that savings seven years after the president said it would be achieved - by 2019.	3	2	1		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	"Many of the changes in the Affordable Care Act are starting this year, and in succeeding years," DeParle told ABC News, "and by 2019 we estimate that the average family will save around $2,000."	3	3	1		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	DeParle said that the "big increases that occurred (in 2010) were probably driven by insurance plans overestimating what the impact would be and maybe trying to take some profits upfront before some of the changes in the Affordable Care Act occur."	3	1	3		4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	The White House did not return a call for comment about the big increases in 2011.	1	1	2		4

439	olympus-former-executives-plead-guilty-scandal-trial-013639963--finance	Prosecutors charged ex-chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, former executive vice-president Hisashi Mori and former auditor Hideo Yamada with inflating the company's net worth in financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 2007 and 2008, in violation of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law.	1	1	2		4	
439	olympus-former-executives-plead-guilty-scandal-trial-013639963--finance	"The full responsibility lies with me and I feel deeply sorry for letting down our business partners, shareholders and the wider public," Kikukawa told the Tokyo district court at the start of the trial.	3	1	3		4

447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Overnight dementia 'camp' allows caregivers rest	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	NEW YORK (AP) — Just after 10 p.m., when most people their age are going to sleep, a group of elderly folks suffering from dementia are just getting started, dancing and shaking tambourines and maracas in a raucous version of "La Bamba."	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	"It's a party," says an 81-year-old woman, among dozens of patients brought to a Bronx nursing home every night for a structured series of singalongs, crafts and therapy sessions that lasts until dawn.	2	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	The program, which appears to be rare, is kind of a "night camp" for dementia victims who don't sleep at night or tend to wake up agitated or become frightened or disoriented by the fall of darkness.	2	1	2		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	It's meant to provide care and activity — lots of activity — to fill the wee hours for people with Alzheimer's and similar diseases who live at home.	2	2	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	And it's meant to provide their caregivers — usually a son or daughter — with a treasured night's sleep.	2	2	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	"Without this program, my father would be lost, and I would be crazy," said Robert Garcia, whose 82-year-old father, Felix, is in the program at the Hebrew Home at Riverdale called ElderServe at Night.	3	1	2		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	"He doesn't sleep.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	At night he's wide awake, and he needs activity."	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Garcia, who lives in a Bronx apartment with his wife and three of their children, said that before his father went into the program he would wake up in the night, loudly, and keep everyone else from sleeping.	2	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	"We would all wake up, and my daughter would ask, 'Why is Grandpa screaming?	2	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Why is he so grumpy?'"	2	1	2	S	4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Garcia said.	1	1	1	S	4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	"Now he comes home in the morning, shows me his drawings, tells me what they did all night."	2	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	While many nursing homes offer temporary "respite care" so caregivers can catch up on sleep or go on vacation, the overnight-only program at the Hebrew Home fills a niche.	2	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	But costs are high, and such programs are rare.	2	1	2		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	An official at the Alzheimer's Association said she knew of no other.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Daniel Reingold, president and CEO of the Hebrew Home, said the nonsectarian overnight program was started in 1998 because anecdotal studies found the biggest reason people gave for admitting loved ones into the nursing home was sleep deprivation of the caregiver.	2	2	2		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	"Someone with Alzheimer's can be getting up at 3 a.m., banging the pots and pans, thinking they were making dinner, even walking out of the house," Reingold said.	2	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	"We heard stories of caregivers who were sleeping on mattresses across the front doorway so their loved one couldn't get out."	2	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Most patients' care is covered by Medicaid, which pays the Hebrew Home $140 a night, plus $74 for transportation to and from home.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Dr. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, said sleep problems are typical in dementia and include the syndrome known as "sundowning," in which the fall of darkness causes confusion and fear.	2	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	At the Hebrew Home, shades are kept closed.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Abrams says an overnight activity program like the Hebrew Home's is preferable to "fighting nature by insisting that participants try to sleep."	3	2	2		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Ruth Drew, director of family services at the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, said, "Many family members want to care for relatives with Alzheimer's at home, but in order to do that, the caregivers themselves have to remain healthy.	2	2	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	You cannot stay healthy if you don't get a good night's sleep."	2	1	2		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Many patients sleep a few hours at home during the day.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	As the night passed at the Hebrew Home, other activities were offered to the 34 patients, who were in their 60s to 90s.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Most moved on to a "cooking" program, where they were asked to peel and slice a banana, then add grapes and blueberries for a fruit salad.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	During the slow process, the patients were asked, in English and Spanish, about colors and shapes.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Several downed the fruit as it came their way, before salads could be compiled.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Other nighttime activities include walks through the nearly empty halls of the nursing home and "movie nights" with popcorn.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Patients who are up to it are sometimes taken on field trips; for example, to see the neighborhood's Christmas lights.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	In quiet rooms, patients with more profound dementia were guided in simple puzzles like putting a peg in a hole.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	Others had sand or water poured over their hands to stimulate tactile sensations and perhaps reminiscences.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	"They haven't been to the beach in years," said program director Deborah Messina.	2	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	"Maybe it's a fond memory."	2	2	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	One darkened room was filled with recorded sounds of nature, a pleasant aroma and twinkly lights, all meant to provide gentle stimulation.	1	2	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	On occasion, a patient would nod off.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	There are "resting rooms" for patients who want to sleep, but half-hour naps in their chairs are more common.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	"It's like a sleepover," Messina said.	1	1	1		4	
447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	"It's a little bit of a party, and like a sleepover, when they come home in the morning, they haven't slept much."	1	1	1		4

448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Nearly two decades after Colombian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar died in a hail of bullets, his eldest son is conquering new markets in Mexico - with a fashion line in his father's image.	2	2	4		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	Sebastian Marroquin's designer T-shirts, plastered with photos of Escobar, are hot sellers in Mexican states that are on the front lines of the country's deadly drug war.	3	2	4		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	The shirts are emblazoned with images of the Medellin cartel boss, who flooded the world with cocaine before he was shot dead in 1993.	2	1	4		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	Featuring pictures from Escobar's student ID card, driver's license and other images, the shirts cost between $65 and $95 - a small fortune in a country where about half of the population lives in poverty.	3	1	2		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	"We're not trying to make an apology for drug trafficking, to glamorize it in the way that the media does," insists Marroquin, 39, who was born Juan Pablo Escobar Henao, but changed his name to avoid reprisals after his father's death.	3	1	3		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	In a bid to head off criticism that the line glorifies drug crime, the shirts carry messages to provoke reflection.	3	2	2		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	One bearing Escobar's student card reads: "What's your future looking like?" while a design emblazoned with his driver's license warns: "Nice pace, but wrong way."	3	2	2		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	The cotton shirts, which went on sale last year in Mexico, are selling well in stores in Culiacan, the capital of western Sinaloa state, which is home of Mexico's most wanted trafficker, Sinaloa cartel chief Joaquin "Shorty" Guzman.	2	2	4		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	The clothing is also on sale in Guadalajara in western Jalisco state, long a refuge for drug traffickers, which has been swept up in Mexico's raging drug violence.	2	1	4		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	About 60,000 lives have been lost in the last six years.	2	1	5		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	Analysts warn that the increasingly popular 'Escobar Henao' clothing line simply reinforces an already widespread fascination with the symbols of cartel culture such as marijuana leaves and AK-47s among youngsters in Mexico.	3	2	3		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	"I see it as a strong symbolic product," said Vicente Sanchez, a researcher at Mexico's Colegio de la Frontera Norte.	3	1	3		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	"The state ... has to have a better grasp of things directed at young people, as that's the way that these anti-values gain ground," he added.	3	1	3		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	But Marroquin, who has stores in Austria, Guatemala and the United States as well as Mexico, dismisses criticism, pointing to others who cashed in on his legacy.	3	2	2		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	There are plenty of books on Escobar's exploits and even a Colombian television soap opera, "Pablo Escobar: The Boss of Evil" that aired this year.	2	2	2		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	"Those who set out to criticize me are the same who have profited from the story, life and name of Pablo Escobar," Marroquin told Reuters in an interview on Skype.	3	2	2		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	The 39-year-old has said he held off opening stores in Colombia out of respect for drug trafficking victims there.	2	2	3		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	Despite the success of the clothing line in Mexico and other markets, Marroquin insists that there has been an enduring downside to his father's legacy that has followed the family in the 19 years since his death.	3	2	3		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	"In 1994, we left Colombia ... but because of our surname, we couldn't get a passport anywhere in the world ... for the crime of having Escobar DNA," says Marroquin, who lives in Argentina.	4	1	3		4	
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	"We have lived liked criminals without being them."	4	2	2		4

454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	(AP) — The National Park Service acted properly when it ruled out using wolves to control the elk population in Rocky Mountain National Park, government lawyers argued Thursday before a federal appeals court.	3	1	1	S	4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	The government also defended the use of trained volunteers to help Park Service employees shoot and kill excess elk, saying it didn't violate a hunting ban in national parks.	2	1	2		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	In a hearing before the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a law student representing the wildlife advocacy group WildEarth Guardians argued the Park Service did not give enough consideration to the wolf option and rejected it without giving the public a chance to comment.	2	1	2		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	The group also said letting volunteers shoot elk instead of limiting the shooting to Park Service employees was tantamount to hunting.	2	1	2		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	WildEarth Guardians sued the Park Service in 2008, asking a Denver federal judge to overturn the park's elk-thinning policy.	1	1	2		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	The judge upheld the policy last year, and WildEarth Guardians appealed to the 10th Circuit.	1	1	1		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	The appeals court normally meets in Denver but heard this case at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder as part of an outreach program.	1	1	1		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	The judges did not say when they would rule.	1	1	1		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	Rocky Mountain National Park sometimes has so many elk that they overgraze the vegetation, leaving other animals without enough food and habitat.	2	1	1		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	Few natural predators are left there, and hunting is prohibited, so little remains to keep the elk population in check.	1	1	2		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	The park launched a 20-year program in 2008 to thin the herd by having park employees and trained volunteers under park supervision periodically shoot and kill elk.	1	1	2		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	The program also includes fences to protect vegetation from elk and redistributing some of the animals.	1	1	1		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	Officials said reintroducing wolves to control elk numbers was infeasible.	1	1	1		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	They cited a lack of support from other agencies, safety concerns of people who live nearby, expected conflicts between wolves and humans and the amount of attention that a wolf population would require of park officials.	2	1	2		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	Park spokeswoman Kyle Patterson said 131 elk have been killed in the culling program during since 2008.	1	1	2		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	The current size of the herd in the park's lower elevations is 600 to 800, which is within the target range set by the program, so no elk were killed last winter.	1	2	1		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	No decision has been made on whether or how many elk will be killed this coming winter.	1	1	1		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	Wolves disappeared from much of the West after decades of hunting and government-backed extermination.	1	1	1		4	
454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	They were re-introduced in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in 1995, and some advocates have argued for bringing them back elsewhere.	1	1	1		4

455	pending-home-sales-dip-august-due-supply-shortage-140201287--business	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes slipped in August due to a shortage of lower priced inventory in most of the country, an industry group said on Thursday.	2	1	2		4	
455	pending-home-sales-dip-august-due-supply-shortage-140201287--business	The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in August, fell 2.6 percent to 99.2, but was 10.7 percent higher than last year.	2	1	2		4	
455	pending-home-sales-dip-august-due-supply-shortage-140201287--business	July's reading was revised up to 101.9, the highest level since April 2010, when buyers were racing to use the home-buyer tax credit before the deadline, the group said.	2	2	1		4	
455	pending-home-sales-dip-august-due-supply-shortage-140201287--business	"The performance in month-to-month contract signings has been uneven with ongoing shortages of lower priced inventory in much of the country," the association's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said in a statement.	3	1	2		4

456	pentagon-dont-tweet-former-seals-bin-laden-book-202939677	Today, the reports the Defense Department has issued guidelines on handling No Easy Day, the blow-by-blow memoir about the mission to kill Osama bin Laden and employees are prohibited from tweeting, Facebooking, or using their work email to discuss the book.				i	4	
456	pentagon-dont-tweet-former-seals-bin-laden-book-202939677	They are allowed, however, to purchase a copy of it—and they Pentagon doesn't even mind if they put on a bookshelf rather than, as Scarborough writes, "special containers for classified information."	3	1	1		4	
456	pentagon-dont-tweet-former-seals-bin-laden-book-202939677	Scaborough describes the four other rules as follows:	1	1	1		4

458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Evergreen New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte gave the Bronx Bombers reason to rejoice on Wednesday in his return from a three-month injury absence despite an unfamiliar feel in a pennant race game.	2	2	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	Pitching for the first time since fracturing an ankle on a batted ball on June 27, big-game pitcher Pettitte took the mound before an uncommonly sparse Yankee Stadium crowd of about 15,000 in a rescheduled game to make up for Tuesday night's rainout.	2	1	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	"I probably would have liked more of an October feel," the 40-year-old left-hander said after earning the win in a 4-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays that nudged the Yankees into first place in the American League East.	2	2	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	"It helps you get into the flow.	2	1	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	In the beginning of the game, it was almost like you could hear people talking and I'm just trying to focus, you know what I'm saying?	1	1	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	"So I think for me it would probably have been better if we had a packed house."	2	1	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	Pettitte was not at his sharpest, having to pitch out of first-and-third jams in the second, third and fourth innings, but when he needed to, he was able to coax a ground ball that helped him escape danger.	3	2	2		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	Yankees manager Joe Girardi was pleased.	3	2	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	"He pitched out of some jams, got some important strikeouts.	1	2	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	He did a really good job," said the skipper.	2	2	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	Asked how much Pettitte could help the Yankees, whose 10-game AL East lead in July has evaporated with the charge put on by the red-hot Orioles, Girardi said: "A lot.	2	2	2		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	There's a lot of experience there and he knows how to get it done."	2	2	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	Pettitte, who ended a one-year retirement from the Yankees to come back this season, said he was getting antsy to pitch.	1	1	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	"When you see these guys go through what they've been going through and I've been sitting here watching, trying to cheer-lead for them, it's just great to be able to go out there and contribute a little bit," he said.	2	1	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	"Any time you win at this time of the year is precious."	2	2	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	Girardi said having Pettitte back was big.	2	2	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	"You have confidence in Andy because he knows how to get that double play ball, get that strikeout and make the big pitch, and know he's not going to be overwhelmed by the situation."	2	2	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	Pettitte, who improved to 4-3, threw 75 pitches, right at the limit Girardi had set for him in his return.	1	1	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	He gave up four hits, walked two and struck out three.	1	1	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	"I didn't think my command was as sharp as I would like.	2	1	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	But it's obviously a good win and I'll take it," said Pettitte, a perfectionist who has thrived in the postseason and tops Major League Baseball's all-time list with 19 postseason wins.	2	2	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	"It's good to get out there and compete with these guys.	2	2	1		4

458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	I just have to get my legs back in shape and get my pitch count up so I can get us late into games."	1	1	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	Pettitte, winner of five World Series rings with the Yanks, said the team expects the race to go down to the wire.	1	1	1		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	"We know this is going to be a dog fight," added Pettitte, who said the team saw highlights of Tuesday night's 18-inning win by the Orioles over Seattle before Wednesday's game.	2	1	2		4	
458	pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb	"Obviously, you'd love to see them lose some games, but we just need to keep winning, keep playing well."	1	1	1		4

459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	Philippines, Muslim rebels close to peace deal	1	2	1		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine government and Muslim rebels resumed talks Tuesday on resolving final differences in a preliminary peace accord they hope to conclude soon, in what is expected to be a major breakthrough toward ending a decades-long rebellion in the country's south.	2	2	1		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	Government negotiators met with representatives of the 11,000-strong Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to attempt to seal what they call a "framework agreement" on major issues, including the extent of power, revenues and territory to be granted to a Muslim-administered region.	1	2	1		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	It would be the most significant progress in years of negotiations on ending a rebellion that has left more than 120,000 people dead and held back development in the south.	2	2	3		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	Western governments have long been worried that rebel strongholds could become breeding grounds for al-Qaida-affiliated extremists.	3	1	2		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	Rebel negotiator Mohagher Iqbal said at the talks' resumption that they are "now on the home stretch and the smell of success is reinforced every day."	2	2	1		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	Iqbal warned that if the negotiations are not concluded soon, opponents might endanger a final deal.	3	1	2		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	A breakaway rebel group has opposed the talks, and some Christian politicians, wary of losing land and power to minority Muslims, have been accused of undermining the negotiations.	3	1	2		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	"If we cannot conclude it soon successfully, now that we are at the brink of the exercise, we will be in trouble," Iqbal said.	2	1	2		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	"The greatest source of risk comes from spoilers, leaders, and parties who believe that these ... negotiations threaten their power and interests."	2	1	2		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	Government negotiator Marvic Leonen said that "to state that what we hope to be able to do again in the next few days is historical is definitely an understatement."	3	1	1		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	"We are on the brink of layering the written predicates that can frame the process of building trust as we usher in an era of peace, of hope and of recovery," Leonen said.	3	3	1		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	The Moro rebel group has been fighting for self-rule for minority Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation's south.	1	1	1		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	It dropped a demand for a separate Muslim state and now seeks an expansion of an existing Muslim autonomous region and more powers and resources to rehabilitate the violent, poverty-wracked area.	2	1	1		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	The initial accord is to contain general agreements on key issues.	1	1	1		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	A transition commission would be established to work out the details of the preliminary pact, which would hopefully lead to a final accord in as little as three years, Iqbal has said.	1	2	1		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	In 2008, the planned signing of a preliminary pact was scuttled when opponents went to the Supreme Court, which declared the agreement unconstitutional, prompting three rebel commanders to attack Christian communities in the south.	1	1	2		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	The attacks and an ensuing military offensive killed more than 100 people and displaced about 750,000 villagers before a cease-fire was forged.	1	1	3		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	Last August, a rebel faction opposed to the talks attacked several army camps and outposts in southern Maguindanao and North Cotabato provinces, sparking two weeks of sporadic fighting that left more than 50 dead and displaced 45,000 others.	1	1	3		4	
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	The new unrest eased after the military launched a crackdown.	1	2	1		4

460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — An independent drama that explores the loneliness and missed opportunities of an ailing, 70-year-old gay man is testing Philippine sensibilities about sexuality and hoping to advance in the Academy Awards' foreign-language film competition next year.	2	2	2		4	
460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	"Bwakaw," or "Voracious," has received positive reviews and local awards and is doing the rounds of international film festivals in Toronto, New York, Hawaii and Tokyo.	1	2	1		4	
460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	Writer and director Jun Robles Lana says the movie is named after a stray dog with a voracious appetite for life that has a bond with the main character, Rene. Bwakaw's zest for life contrasts with Rene's grumpy disposition.	1	1	2		4	
460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	Rene came out of the closet in his twilight years, thinks it is too late for love and only awaits his own death. He has made a will and labeled his few possessions to be given away to friends. He even bought a coffin at a funeral home's closing-out sale.	1	1	2		4	
460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	But when Bwakaw dies after an illness, Rene, played by veteran actor Eddie Garcia, finds new appreciation for life. "It's the dog that basically teaches him to live life to the fullest," Lana said in an interview Wednesday.	2	2	1		4	
460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	"It's really more about loneliness, although you can't help that some people or critics are branding it a gay film simply because the character is gay, but that's really beside the point," he said.	2	1	2		4	
460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	Lana admits that while Filipinos are generally gay-friendly — the most popular movie star is Vice Ganda, an out-and-out gay comedian — local mainstream audiences might not be too receptive to a serious take on homosexuality in the conservative and predominantly Roman Catholic society.	2	1	2		4	
460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	"We tend to look at gay characters as iconic, funny characters," he said. "So when you make a movie like this, you really have to market it in such a way that it would be more appealing to them."	2	1	1		4	
460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	He said that the movie focuses on the comedy aspect in order to appeal to a wider audience.	1	2	1		4	
460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	But the filmmaker hopes that between the laughs, moviegoers will find that it is more than a comedy.	2	1	1		4	
460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	He said he made the film with the intention to honor his mentor, writer Rene Villanueva, who died in 2007.

469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	The biggest take away was from a fading actor, Clint Eastwood, talking to an empty chair.	3	2	2		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	The next event on the calendar was the Democratic convention, and President Obama won this going away, and ended up getting a pretty good bounce from it.	3	2	1		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	Though the bounce didn't completely last, it did settle into a pretty important 3-point lead.	3	2	1		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	Interestingly, the next two moments in the campaign were spontaneous ones that no one could have predicted.	3	1	1		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	First was the Libyan tragedy and violence.	1	1	4		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	In this case, the public judged Obama to have handled the crisis calmly and effectively while Mitt Romney's precipitous statements were viewed by many voters negatively.	2	2	2		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	An Obama win in this event.	1	2	1		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	Another unpredictable moment came with the release and coverage of a tape of Romney at a fundraiser in which the candidate talked disapprovingly of 47 percent of the country - an unforced error but a Romney loss in this event.	2	1	2		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	So we are left with five events to come that include three presidential debates in October, one vice-presidential debate, and an unpredictable moment.	1	1	1		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	In order for Romney and his campaign to get back in this race and have a chance on Election Day, they are going to have to win convincingly at least three of these remaining five moments.	2	1	1		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	And with voting already beginning early in many states, Romney is probably going to need to do very well in that first debate in Denver.	2	1	1		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	That could be a make-or-break moment for his campaign.	2	1	1		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	The only way the Romney campaign can achieve all this is by accepting reality for what it is, not convincing itself anymore that everything is fine.	2	1	1		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	His team must make a real change in the relationship they have with the voters they need to win in this election.	2	1	1		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	And like in life, the first sign of self-respect is taking real accountability for how they got in this mess and accepting the hard truth of what they need to do to succeed.	3	2	2		3	
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	Let's see if they have hit rock bottom and can turn things around for the five events left.	3	1	1		3

470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	As NASA's space shuttle Endeavour orbiter flew to its retirement home in sunny California today (Sept.	1	1	1	S	4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	21), Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. signed legislation to bolster the commercial spaceflight sector in that state.	1	2	1	S	4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	The Assembly bill limits liability for private spaceflight companies.	1	2	1		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	“California aerospace pioneers like Virgin Galactic, SpaceX and the Spaceship Company are blazing a path to the stars with commercial space travel,” Brown said in a statement.	3	2	1		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	“This bill allows commercial space-travel companies to innovate and explore without the worry of excessive liability.”	1	2	2		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	A summary overview of Assembly Bill 2243 shows that it provides qualified immunity from liability to a spaceflight entity for injuries to a space flight participant, so long as a written warning statement is provided to the participant and the injury was not the result of spaceflight entity's gross negligence or intentional acts.	1	2	2		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	[Now Boarding: The Top 10 Private Spaceships]	1	1	1		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	The bill requires a spaceflight entity to have each participant sign a “prescribed warning statement” acknowledging that the participant understands the “inherent risks associated with space flight activity, including death, and also acknowledging that the space flight entity has limited liability for injuries or damages sustained by a participant as a result of these inherent risks.”	1	1	3		4

470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	Leading the measure that was targeted to an emerging industry in California was Assemblyman Steve Knight (R-Palmdale).	1	1	1		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	Last August, the bill unanimously passed in both houses of the California State Legislature.	1	1	1		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	Knight also said in a statement that, until recently, human space travel was accomplished through government space agencies, with volunteer participants assuming liability for injury and damage.	1	1	2		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	Assembly Bill 2243 provides limited liability for commercial space ventures to ensure innovators remain competitive in this promising marketplace.	1	2	1		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	“California, and specifically the High Desert, has a long tradition of pioneering aviation for a century, and human spaceflight since the Apollo era, and was the site of the first private human space flight event, which resulted in the winning of the Ansari X Prize in Mojave, California, in 2004,” Knight said.	1	2	1		4

470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	Over the past few decades, Knight added, California has lost a significant slice of its human spaceflight industry development to other states, specifying Alabama, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Texas.	2	1	2		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	The human spaceflight business in California, he said, continues to struggle due to the poor business climate in general, and the current litigious environment.	1	1	2		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	“The history of space flight and California are inseparable,” Knight said.	1	1	1		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	“Providing the commercial space industry with a competitive advantage will ensure our state maintains and possibly gains jobs in this important market.”	2	2	1		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	The bill-signing was praised by Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson, who called California a state that tears down barriers and cultivates innovation, from social movements like environmentalism to the start-up culture of Silicon Valley.	2	2	1		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	Branson called the bill a benefit to the teams at Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Co. at the Mojave Air and Space Port — the construction site of the WhiteKnightTwo/SpaceShipTwo launch system.	1	2	1		4	
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	“This legislation will ensure that California continues to be a place that looks forward … and not back,” Branson said.	2	2	1		4

471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	I feel I am modestly qualified to make these assignments because of my past experience covering politics at the network level, and because this year, I might well be — for the first time — a viewer.	3	1	1		3

471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	The three Big Stories of the night are obvious: Will Obama get re-elected?	2	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	Will Republicans take control of the Senate?	1	1	1		3

471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	If I were producing the coverage, I'd make sure that, at all times in the lower third of the screen space, we'd have a graphic showing the current and projected advantage for Republicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate.	3	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	These numbers ought to be automatically updated to reflect new projections.	3	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	That is, let's say that it's 9:00 p.m. ET, and based on the races that have been called and projected so far, Democrats are clinging to a one-seat Senate majority.	2	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	Right now, Democrats have a four-seat edge (two independents caucusing as Democrats, the vice presidential tie breaker, and 51 seats to their name).	1	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	So the two data points that could be useful right at that moment would show the current composition (53) and the projected composition (51).	2	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	But the more accurate graphic would show how many seats Republicans need to win to flip the chamber.	2	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	And that's four, not three.	1	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	So producers: Your graphic should look something like this.	3	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	It should be on screen at all times, or rotated with the House control graphic, which I'll describe next.	3	1	1		3

471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	But this tells the casual viewer very little.	2	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	Republicans have a 25-seat advantage in the House.	1	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	So the House graphic would read:	2	1	1		3

471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	Since polls in Hawaii and Alaska don't close until very late, networks have to use projections.	3	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	What makes the second part of the graphic interesting is that it can be updated in real-time to reflect House projections and real-vote returns that come in.	2	2	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	(All networks use essentially the same computer back-end to crunch the numbers; their projection models differ slightly based on the political scientists and analysts who serve on the decision desks.)	1	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	As the PROJECTED number is updated, it can flash — and anchors/reporters can explain (briefly) why the projection has changed, and perhaps the races that have been called can also flash on the screen.	1	1	1		3	
471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	The graphic does not perfectly correspond to the 435 individual House elections because some can't be called even though the winner might be obvious.	1	1	1		3

472	proof-star-treks-warp-drive-might-actually-182000581	Star Trek fans know that the Starship Enterprise zips around the universe — and escapes some seriously hairy situations — with warp drive, a technology that allows Captain Kirk and Co. to move faster than the speed of light.	3	2	1		5	
472	proof-star-treks-warp-drive-might-actually-182000581	Warp drive may seem far-fetched to some (Mel Brooks once mocked it as "Ludicrous Speed" in his comedy Space Balls), but it's actually related to the theory that space-time, the fabric of space, can be manipulated to allow objects to move faster than photons of light.	2	1	1		5	
472	proof-star-treks-warp-drive-might-actually-182000581	And now a NASA scientist, Harold White, says he has created a feasible model for warp drive, building on a theory expounded by Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994.	1	1	1		5

472	proof-star-treks-warp-drive-might-actually-182000581	White says Alcubierre's model would be far more energy efficient with a ring shaped like a rounded doughnut, instead of a flat ring.	2	2	1		5	
472	proof-star-treks-warp-drive-might-actually-182000581	In addition, White says "the intensity of the space warps can be oscillated over time," further reducing the energy required, says Clara Moskowitz at Space.com.	1	2	1		5	
472	proof-star-treks-warp-drive-might-actually-182000581	With these adjustments, White says his warp drive can be powered with a "mass about the size of a spacecraft like the Voyager 1 probe NASA launched in 1977."	1	1	1		5

472	proof-star-treks-warp-drive-might-actually-182000581	They are using a "laser interferometer" to make miniscule versions of space-time warps, in what White has described as a "tabletop experiment."	3	1	1		5

473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	TBILISI (Reuters) - Nana Dumbadze was all set to vote for Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili's party in an election next week. That is, until she saw television footage of prisoners being raped.	1	1	3		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	The 37-year-old teacher was so shocked that she has decided to switch allegiance from the leader of the Rose Revolution that swept out the ex-Soviet old guard in 2003 to an opposition bloc, Georgian Dream, led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili.	2	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	The prison brutality scandal, which has ignited protests, has left Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM) facing an unexpectedly tough battle to keep power in the volatile Caucasus state, a transit route for oil and gas to the West.	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	It has raised the stakes for Saakashvili. He has promised to leave the presidency next year and needs a UNM victory in the October 1 parliamentary election to keep a hand on Georgia's reins and avoid the risk of political oblivion.	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	The parliament will have stronger powers after next year's presidential election and Saakashvili could steer an ally into the post of prime minister with enhanced authority or take the job himself, though he is not expected to do that.	2	1	1		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	"I'd intended to vote for Saakashvili's party but after watching what we've all seen on TV I've changed my mind and will vote for the opposition now," Dumbadze said. "I think it's immoral to vote for this government."	2	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	Dumbadze described asking her mother to make sure her two sons, aged seven and 10, do not see the footage on television while she is away at work or on errands.	1	1	1		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	The scandal has dimmed the image the pro-Western, U.S.-educated Saakashvili cultivated as a reformer who has curbed corruption and ushered in democracy, handing ammunition to foes who say he has actually trampled on rights and freedoms.	2	1	3		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	The grim footage has enabled Ivanishvili, a once-reclusive tycoon who has a spectacular glass and steel house overlooking Tbilisi, to call the vote "a choice between good and evil".	2	2	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	Saakashvili, 44, became the West's political darling when he rose to power after the bloodless revolution that toppled Eduard Shevardnadze, a former Soviet foreign minister.	2	2	1		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	But opponents have accused Saakashvili of monopolizing power and criticized him for leading Georgia into a disastrous five-day war with Russia in 2008. His promise to take Georgia into NATO remains unfulfilled and has soured relations with Moscow.	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	The abuse scandal has increased tensions before the vote, prompting calls for restraint from the West.	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	The opposition says 60 supporters have been detained by police, describing an "atmosphere of fear and intimidation". The ruling party says supporters have been attacked by protesters and urged the six-party Georgian Dream to reject violence.	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	Saakashvili's government says the video, which shows guards beating, punching and humiliating prisoners, as well as inmates being raped with various objects, was recorded by guards who were bribed by "politically motivated persons".	1	1	3		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	But Saaskashvili has also promised to clean up the jails. His interior and prisons ministers have resigned. The Tbilisi prison chief, two deputies and several guards have been arrested.	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	"I think they did quite well in reacting," said Thomas de Waal, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. Whether it will be enough for Saakashvili's party to hold onto power is less clear.	2	2	1		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	FADED ROSE?	1	1	1		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	An opinion poll in August put UNM on 37 percent support against 12 percent for Georgian Dream and showed 43 percent of respondents could vote either way. No polls have appeared since the protests but the opposition is expected to make gains.	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	"I think that these events will have a huge impact on the election and will overshadow the nihilism, illusions and the government's propaganda," said Shorena Shaverdashvili, editor-in-chief of the independent Liberal magazine.	2	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	De Waal said the abuse scandal would "help support the opposition narrative in Georgia that the government has built a facade which hides unpleasant realities and has failed to improve the lives of ordinary people."	2	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	"But the opposition is still less well mobilized and hasn't been able to articulate very well what it is offering instead and the electoral system also favors the ruling party, so I still expect the UNM to win more seats on October 1," he added.	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	Many Georgians just want better living standards.	2	2	1		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	"I'll vote for anyone whose promises seem the most realistic," said Lali Narmania, 58, who lives in a shabby apartment on Tbilisi's outskirts with her disabled husband and son, existing on a monthly state allowance of 250 lari ($150).	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	Narmania is unemployed and her husband is bedridden by a wound from the 1992-1993 war in which the Black Sea region of Abkhazia broke from Tbilisi's control.	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	Georgia's economy, hit by the war and the global financial crisis, has been growing again since 2010. But inflation was 11.2 percent that year and the government expects a rate of 6-7 percent this year after a dip to 2 percent in 2011.	2	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	Saakashvili was hailed by the West as a shining example for his promise to clean up the corruption, rigged elections and economic stagnation that blighted Georgia's first decade of independence after the Soviet Union collapsed.	1	2	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	His team restored 24-hour electricity and clamped down on police bribe-taking, and the economy took off before the war and crisis. But critics accuse him of curbing democracy, persecuting opponents, pressuring courts and controlling the media.	1	2	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	The war with Russia put Abkhazia and the rebel region of South Ossetia, both now recognized by Moscow as independent nations, further from Georgia's reach. Russian leaders depict Saakashvili as a hothead itching to take the regions by force.	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	Saakashvili, for his part, says President Vladimir Putin wants to gain sway over a country that was under Russian or Soviet control for almost two centuries. He has called the abuse scandal "Russian mud" financed with "Russian money".	1	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	"Those who thought that they could carry out Putin's orders in our country will be very disappointed," Saakashvili told supporters on Sunday in Zugdidi in western Georgia.	2	1	2		4	
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	Ivanishvili, who has sold the Russian assets that were a chunk of his estimated $6.4 billion, says Saakashvili is playing the "Russian card" to draw attention away from internal problems. "Saakashvili just wants you to forget about what you've all seen," Ivanishvili told a crowd in Zugdidi.	2	1	2		4

474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	New research suggests we may be able to sniff out psychopaths by their poor scores on a smell test.	2	2	2		4	
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	In the study, psychologists at Macquarie University in Australia tested the noses of more than 70 college-age participants, all without criminal records.	1	1	1		4	
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	The researchers had the subjects try to identify common odors (like orange, coffee and leather) and distinguish between different scents.	1	1	1		4	
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	The participants then were given personality tests to check for their level of empathy and psychopathic tendencies.	1	1	1		4	
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	For example, the subjects were asked to rate on a 5-point scale how much they agreed with statements such as: "I purposely flatter people to get them on my side;" "People sometimes say that I'm cold-hearted;" and "I have broken into a building or vehicle in order to steal something or vandalize."	1	1	1		4	
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	Psycopathy is a personality disorder marked by superficial charm, a lack of empathy and impulsive tendencies.	1	1	2		4	
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	The researchers reported a correlation between a poorer sense of smell and psychopathic personality traits.	1	2	2		4	
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	They say this makes sense because previous research has shown that people with such traits have decreased function in the brain's frontal lobes, a region associated with impulse control and acting in accordance with social norms — and dysfunction in that part of the brain is associated with an impaired sense of smell.	1	1	1		4	
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	Criminal psychopaths' speech patterns can also give them away, according to research presented in 2011.	1	2	1		4	
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	When speaking of their crimes, psychopaths use less emotion and focus more on their basic needs than non-psychopaths, that research found.	1	1	2		4	
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	Psychopaths, believed to make up as much as 1 percent of the general population, may attempt to fake answers during psychological evaluations, so a measure of smelling ability could offer a helpful new way to detect psychopathic traits, the researchers said.	2	2	2		4	
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	The study, led by Mehmet K. Mahmut and Richard J. Stevenson, was published recently in the journal Chemosensory Perception.	1	1	1		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	Putin speaks out against unilateral intervention	1	2	2		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that any attempt to unilaterally use force or interfere with events in the Middle East or North Africa would be counter-productive, rebutting growing calls to intervene in Syria's civil war.	2	1	2		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	Russia and China have strongly opposed the idea of foreign intervention in Syria, vetoing three United Nations Security Council resolutions backed by Western and Arab states that would have increased pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to stop the bloodshed.	3	2	3		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	Both countries have also voiced opposition to new sanctions on Iran and to any moves to attack it.	2	1	2		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	"Attempts to replace the universal principles of the U.N. Charter by unilateral actions or partisan deals, moreover to use force bypassing the U.N. do not do any good, as is well known," Putin told foreign ambassadors in the Kremlin, where he was receiving their new credentials.	1	1	2		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	Putin said his warning concerned civil unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, adding that the U.N. Charter was meant to be used to solve problems "through negotiations, without external interference".	1	2	2		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	"Incitement of violence in different forms in order to change the regime only pushes the situation into a dead end.	1	1	3		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	Violence creates violence," Putin said.	1	1	3		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	Putin's warning came as Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani told the U.N. General Assembly in New York that Arab nations should intervene in Syria given the U.N. Security Council's failure to stop the conflict there.	2	1	3		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	The 18-month-old revolt, which began as peaceful street protests, has escalated into a civil war in which activists say over 27,000 people have died.	1	2	4		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	Russia accused NATO of overstepping a U.N. Security Council mandate for a no fly zone over Libya last year to help rebels overthrow former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.	2	1	2		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	Earlier this month, Putin condemned the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya but made it clear he believed Western support for rebels in Arab countries was fuelling chaos.	2	1	3		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	"Most recently we received proof that such a position is right.	1	2	1		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	It is time to learn some lessons from what is going on," Putin said on Wednesday.	1	1	1		4	
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	Russia has also accused Western nations of encouraging Syrian rebels including armed extremists.	2	1	2		4

478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	There was a lot to like in her first crack at this touchstone role, which the legendary Maria Callas restored to the modern repertory in 1957.	2	2	1		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	The basic quality of Radvanovsky's voice can be thrilling — a penetrating sound that is hard-edged without being harsh.	3	3	1		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	She unleashed astonishing power, especially at the top of her range (though she was not always able to scale back the volume when she should have).	3	2	1		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	But there were still traces of her tendency to sing flat, and some of her phrasing was rhythmically imprecise.	2	2	2		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	Dramatically, she has not yet found the emotional depth to portray the tragic queen as much more than the weepy victim of a conniving king.	3	1	2		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	The one exception came in the encounter with Ganassi, when the Italian mezzo's own intensity seemed to jump-start her performance.	3	3	1		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	Throughout the night, Ganassi used her ample, plummy voice to create an impassioned portrayal of a woman torn between her love for Henry and her pity for Anna.	3	3	1		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	American bass Owen Gradus made a handsome, swaggering Henry, binge-eating and drinking as he engineered the trap that would rid him of his unwanted wife.	3	2	2		4

478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	Georgian tenor Shalva Mukeria displayed a pleasant, slightly nasal sound and nailed his many high notes as Anna's beloved Percy.	3	2	1		4

478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	But Lawless has a way of belaboring the obvious, including his overuse of Anna's daughter, the young girl who would become Queen Elizabeth — and figure prominently in two subsequent Donizetti operas.	2	1	2		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	The real Elizabeth was not yet 3 when Anna died and has no role in the opera as written.	2	2	2		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	Played here as a girl of about 10, she is dragged into numerous scenes to witness her mother's degradation, even watching as Anna puts her head on the chopping block at the end.	3	2	2		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	In a program note, Lawless speculates this may be why Elizabeth never married!	2	2	2		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	There were other miscues, like the pantomime during the overture that showed Henry shedding one wife for the next, played incongruously for laughs.	3	3	2		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	And it was a mistake to drop a large grill with prison bars during Anna's final scene, obscuring our view of her just when we should be focusing our eyes on nothing else.	2	1	2		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	The production, which opened the company's season Saturday night, runs for six more performances through Oct. 6.	1	1	1		4	
478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	For Radvanovsky, it's a warm-up for an even more demanding assignment: In coming seasons she will repeat the role at the Metropolitan Opera and will add the heroines of Donizetti's two other "queen" operas — "Maria Stuarda" and "Roberto Devereaux."	2	2	1		4

480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	LONDON (Reuters) - The credit rating firm DBRS is in no rush to change its Spanish rating despite the country's worsening economy because stabilization measures such as the European Central Bank's new bond-buying program could start at any point.	2	2	3		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	DBRS is one of four firms the ECB uses to rate collateral, but following serial downgrades from S&P, Fitch and Moody's, is the only one saving Spanish bonds from an extra 5 percent charge the ECB automatically applies to sub A-rated sovereign bonds used as collateral in its lending operations.	2	1	2		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	Markets' eyes are currently trained on Moody's to see whether it strips Spain of its investment grade status as Madrid struggles with cash-strapped regions, an ailing bank system and rising debt refinancing costs.	2	1	3		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	It delayed the decision on Tuesday to give itself until the end of the month, but some analysts believe a downgrade from Baa3 could help push Madrid to take EU aid.	3	2	3		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	Despite that focus, a DBRS downgrade would do more real damage because unless they could find alternative assets, it would cut the amount of ECB money Spanish banks would be able to borrow.	2	1	3		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	Madrid may be able to relax a little though.	2	2	2		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	Fergus McCormick, head of sovereign ratings for DBRS, said the fact European help was waiting in the wings would spare Spain from any knee-jerk rating changes.	3	2	2		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	"In the context of a weak economic environment, an unclear policy response from Europe, and popular discontent in Spain, the higher deficits are worrying and place further downward pressure on our A (low) rating, which has a Negative trend," McCormick told Reuters.	3	1	3		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	"And yet, we are not going to jump to conclusions.	2	2	2		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	Why?				S	4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	Because the backstop could come into play and stabilize bond markets, providing Spain time to reduce its deficit more gradually and implement tough structural reforms."	2	2	2		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	He added there were a lot of unanswered questions on whether the euro zone's bailout funds will, as previously indicated, help to recapitalize Spain's banks, and also on how the ECB will deploy its new bond-buying program.	3	2	2		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	"We have no doubt that Europe has the ammunition to stabilize the situation.	3	3	2		4	
480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	Whether it will use it remains to be seen," McCormick said in e-mailed comments.	3	2	2		4

481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	(Reuters) - The Baltimore Ravens will be looking to avenge a heartbreaking loss that cost them a trip to the Super Bowl last season when they host the New England Patriots in primetime on Sunday for Week Three's marquee showdown.	2	2	2		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	A missed 32-yard field goal from then Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff that likely would have sent the AFC Championship into overtime is the lasting memory of the Patriots' 23-20 win but the pain was particularly acute for some Baltimore veterans.	2	2	3		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	Ed Reed, one of the finest free safeties of the past decade, considered retirement after the bitter disappointment of that January loss but decided to return for one more shot at a Super Bowl championship ring.	3	1	3		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	On Sunday he comes face to face with the Patriots again but insists the defeat is no longer on his mind.	2	2	3		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	"That was last year.	3	1	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	They only crowned one champ last year, if I'm not mistaken.	3	1	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	It's behind us," Reed, 34, told reporters.	3	2	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	"We're a totally different team this year.	3	2	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	We don't even have some of the same guys on the team.	2	2	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	It's always a new year the next year.	3	2	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	I know I'm not worried about what happened last year.	2	2	2		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	It was over and done with after that game."	2	2	2		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	The changes to the Ravens roster have been matched by some alterations in style with quarterback Joe Flacco making more use of the no-huddle offense but it remains the defense, with Reed and fellow veteran Ray Lewis, that is the defining aspect of the Baltimore team.	2	2	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	"They're very, very talented players, they play well within their scheme, and they complement each other well," said Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.	3	4	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	"They're very physical, they're very tough, they're very smart and they really take advantage of bad offensive plays.	3	3	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	"I think more so than anything, they really capitalize on mistakes, so we've got to try to limit our mistakes."	3	2	2		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	The Patriots have managed to do that pretty well against Baltimore - their only loss in seven meetings came in the 2009 season's wild card round, with Reed one of three Ravens to intercept Brady.	2	2	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	"He's pretty much ingrained permanently in my mind," Brady said.	3	2	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	"He's such a playmaker for them, and he shows up in a lot of different spots.	3	3	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	"He has such a great understanding of what offenses are doing.	3	5	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	He obviously studies hard; he competes incredibly hard, and if you make a mistake, he really capitalizes."	3	5	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	In other action, the Miami Dolphins host the rival New York Jets on Sunday in an AFC East divisional clash that will have some extra spice as it marks Jets' offensive coordinator Tony Sparano's return to Miami, where he was a head coach before being fired last year.	2	2	2		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	The New Orleans Saints, 2009 Super Bowl winners, look to avoid an 0-3 start when they host the Kansas City Chiefs who are also 0-2 this season.	2	1	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	"I'm optimistic that we're going to get this thing back on track very quickly," said Saints quarterback Drew Brees.	3	3	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	"Obviously we're disappointed by the 0-2 start, but there's nothing we can do about it now except learn from our mistakes."	2	2	2		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	In contrast, two of the league's six unbeaten teams will meet in San Diego where the Chargers host the Atlanta Falcons.	2	2	1		4	
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	The 2-0 Houston Texans travel to Denver to face Peyton Manning and the 1-1 Broncos while Monday night's game sees the Green Bay Packers at the Seattle Seahawks.	1	1	1		4

483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	NEW YORK (AP) — For a short time this fall, Broadway will feature Frankie Valli in two different places.	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	There will be the fake one taking the stage of the August Wilson Theatre for the Tony-winning "Jersey Boys," and the real one appearing for seven nights at the Broadway Theater with The Four Seasons beginning Oct. 19.	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	The 78-year old Valli has been belting iconic hits like "Can't Take My Eyes Off You," and "Sherry" with his trademark falsetto for years. Recently, the New Jersey native spoke to The Associated Press about his career, a stint on "The Sopranos" and where to get the best corned beef sandwich in New York.	2	2	2			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	___				I		
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	AP: What's special about playing Broadway this fall?	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	Valli: I can't think of anybody who had a play on Broadway about their life and appeared on Broadway at the same time, so it was something that I was trying to get happening for a couple years and unable to get anybody to really understand what I was talking about.	1	1	2			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	AP: Since recording technology was far less sophisticated when you started out, how important was it to emotionally deliver the song in the studio?	1	1	2			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	Valli: The first and most important part about having a hit record is something that I learned a long, long time ago. You needed to have a hit song in order to have a hit record. If you didn't have a hit song it didn't matter how great the performance was or the arrangement or the production — you didn't have a hit record. That's just the way it was. It didn't matter if your name was Frank Sinatra or James Brown. It just didn't matter. Every artist has misses. You hopefully go into the studio and do music that your audience is going to like but that does mean they're gonna like everything that you make and sometimes you can run out of ideas.	2	2	3			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	AP: How did The Four Seasons approach it?	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	Valli: I always looked at The Four Seasons as being more of an innovative group for the kind of music that they did. We really never followed what was happening on the radio. We weren't listening to what was happening on the radio. We went in and made music that we loved to do. We had fun doing it. I think when you start to sit down and try to figure out what is it that makes the hit is when you begin to have trouble.	2	4	2			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	AP: What was it about The Four Seasons and that era?	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	Valli: It was a very strange phenomenon because we were a guy's group and girls liked what we did, but in a lot of cases there were groups that guys didn't like because they felt they were being threatened. We were not that. We were saying a lot of things that these street guys wanted to say.	1	3	2			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	AP: When did you realize you wanted to be a recording artist?	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	Valli: I first started out in this business not really wanting to be a pop singer. I was more interested in jazz. That's what I wanted to do. And I remember as a kid, I would sit in the kitchen on the floor — we lived in the projects — with the door open to the outside and I'd listen to "Symphony" Sid, which was on the radio from 12 at night until 6 in the morning. My father would go bananas so I had to keep it so low.	3	1	3			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	AP: What led you to your trademark falsetto vocals?	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	Valli: A lot of groups did. They just used falsetto a little differently than they did. We used it as a lead-in. We used it much stronger. Everybody else used it as background. In a lot of cases we used it as background, too. I sang lead and then when we were making the record I sang a high background part with it.	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	AP: At what point did you know you were onto something?	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	Valli: To be perfectly honest with you, at first when I decided to do pop music I wasn't overly excited, you know? I was trying to do this jazz thing. Jazz wasn't really happening to any great degree. Listening to the radio one day I said, 'Hell, I can do this too.'	2	2	2			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	AP: What would we be surprised to learn that you listen to?	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	Valli: I like country music, I like jazz, and I like blues. (Bob) Dylan is probably one of my all-time favorite, favorite people that there is. Probably America's greatest poet. I've always seen him as that. As (Bruce) Springsteen is the other side of Dylan. Dylan brings out everything that's wrong in the world and Springsteen he finds things that are good.	4	3	2			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	AP: What was it like playing Rusty Millio on the "Sopranos"?	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	Valli: I loved it. It's a part of my life that was really a part of my life, although I was never mobbed up. I grew up in New Jersey. I lived in a neighborhood where there was a presence of organized crime... but all the clubs and bars that everybody worked in were owned by these guys. So I got to know everybody.	1	4	3			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	AP: What did you have for lunch?	1	1	1			
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	Valli: We went for a corned beef sandwich on Houston Street — Katz Deli. The secret isn't in not how much meat it is. I don't know if you noticed but they cut it with a knife. It doesn't cut on a machine because it just crumbles. There are no places that do it like that anymore. They undercook it in most places, because they get more sandwiches out of it. You overcook it, and it shrinks. But that's the only way it tastes just right.	2	2	3

484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Reality TV: The Invisible Front in Hollywood's Labor Wars	3	1	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Reality TV is the invisible front in Hollywood's labor wars.	3	1	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Though reality TV workers once made it as far as the bargaining table, most are as far as ever from winning union representation.	1	2	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Under its former president, the strongly pro-organizing Patric Verrone, the Writers Guild West tried to shine a public spotlight on the sector with its "Reality Rights" campaign.	2	3	1			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	But the issue was knocked out at the finish line in the guild's last contract negotiations with the studios and networks. Meanwhile improved work conditions, a fragmented, freelance work force and pressures of a weak economy have set those efforts back considerably since 2009.	3	1	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	WGAW's Director of Communications Neal Sacharow, insists the fight isn't over yet. "We want writers in reality TV who want to organize their production companies or shows to know that the WGAW is ready and available to work with them to get Guild representation," he told TheWrap.	3	3	1			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	But since Verrone was defeated by Christopher Keyser in his bid for re-election last year, the WGAW's efforts have taken on a much lower profile and their tactics have changed dramatically.	2	1	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Other obstacles remain in the path of unionization.	1	1	2			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Jeff Bartsch has worked as a television editor for years on shows including "America's Next Top Model", "Supernanny" and "Blind Date."	1	1	1			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	"Reality is the Walmart of TV production," he told TheWrap. "Networks pit production companies against each other and bid production budgets down so low that producers often feel that the added cost of union contracts would cost them, and their employees, their jobs."	1	1	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Bartsch remembers taking part in the WGA-sponsored effort in 2009 to organize reality editors and story producers but said that things have changed. He noted that certain reality production companies in Hollywood - once known as the worst offenders in treating their employees - have improved working conditions, making organizing more difficult than it already had been.	3	2	4			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Then there's the problem of determining what is out there to organize.	1	1	2			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	There is no umbrella group for the production companies. Many production firms are put together for a specific project, the way a TV movie or indie film is. The projects can be one-offs, planned for single season or simply canceled quickly. Neither the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers nor the Motion Picture Association of America maintains overall data on the sector.	1	1	1			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	One of the best indicators of reality's scope comes from FilmLA. The non-profit agency responsible for issuing location permits reports that for the past three years, about 40 percent of the TV permits issued have been for reality projects.	1	1	1			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	In the second quarter of this year, reality TV projects accounted for 1,461 permitted production days. That dwarfed the permitted days for dramas (581), sitcoms (274) and pilots (253)..	2	1	2			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	"That's a big part of the problem," said Steve Dayan, the business manager for Teamsters Local 399. "So many of these shows are so small and so transitory that by the time you become aware of them, they're gone.	1	1	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	The economy doesn't help, either, particularly here in California where so many productions have left the state."	1	1	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Many of the shows that do stay are extremely low-budget, which is a big part of their appeal to the networks. And there is a sense among producers, and even some cast and crew members, that unionization is not the best business model.	1	2	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Other elements of reality TV production make it a challenge to organize workers.	1	1	2			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Employees tend to move from one project to another and often switch companies at the same time. And the workers are often young people anxious to gain a foothold in show business and unconcerned with either health or retirement benefits.	1	1	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	"It's hard to organize in reality because you have so much freelance employment," Lowell Petersen, executive director of the WGA East told TheWrap. "You don't have traditional setups like nurses in the hospital or factory workers on an assembly line. It's project by project."	1	1	2			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	All that said, some strides have been made.	1	1	1			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	The WGA East scored a landmark victory in July, winning company-paid health benefits, paid time off and compensation minimums for roughly 30 reality writer-producers via deals with Lion Television ("Cash Cab") and Optomen Productions ("Worst Cooks in America"). The deals, which took nearly three years and numerous filings with the National Labor Relations Board to achieve, were the guild's first reality pacts in the region. There is less reality production in New York, and it much of it tends toward documentary-type fare, as opposed to on the West Coast.	1	3	2			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	In August, IATSE's Local 700 won company-paid health and retirement benefits for 11 crew members on the Burbank-based Mission Control Media-produced Syfy show "Hot Set" after shutting down production.	1	3	2			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	And IATSE also brought the crew at "Biggest Loser" into the fold after a two-week walkout in 2010. SAG-AFTRA represents the majority of show hosts and regular performers and the Directors Guild of America points to 650 reality directors under contract since 2003.	1	1	1			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	But those triumphs have been hard to come by and relatively rare, and no one disputes that the majority of reality workers remain non-union.	1	2	2			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and International Alliance of Stage Employees have quietly stepped into the vacuum left by the Writer's Guild West. They are favoring a stealthier, bottom-up approach.	1	2	1			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Dayan of the Teamsters said his union takes a similar tack for the sake of the employees. "They don't want to be seen talking with you because they don't want to be fired," he told TheWrap. "I think of us like the police and fire departments - it takes the citizenry to call first."	1	2	2			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	The unions' motivation isn't entirely altruistic. The difficult economic times and the degree to which the networks have replaced scripted fare with cheaper unscripted shows have taken a toll on some of the unions' dues base and health and pension funds in particular.	2	2	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	"For us, safety issues are critical." said Dayan, who represents drivers. "There are federal and state laws that apply when you're transporting employees in terms of drug testing and proper rest. We have to convince the employers that using union drivers is not only the safe way and the right thing to do, but it is cost-effective."	2	3	2			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	Dayan remains optimistic, but said he wished that the Teamsters and other unions had been more aggressive when reality TV production began exploding in about 2000.	2	2	3			
484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	"I would absolutely say there is momentum to organize within the reality sector," Dayan said. "Our relationship with the IA has definitely paid off, and we're making inroads. It's slow, but it's sure."	3	3	2			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	Rebel Wilson proves you can eat dessert every day in Hollywood	1	1	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Playing a character called Fat Amy is probably not the dream of most Hollywood actresses but Australian comedienne Rebel Wilson enjoys breaking the rules - and she's not about to stop eating dessert.	2	3	3			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	After several small but memorable roles in films such as "Bridesmaids" and "Bachelorette," the 27-year-old Wilson looks poised to make it big in the musical film "Pitch Perfect," which opens in U.S. movie theaters on Friday.	2	3	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	The film, about an all-girls college singing group competing against male rivals, has an ensemble cast that includes Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow and R&B singer Ester Dean.	1	1	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	But it is Wilson who steals the show with wild antics and improvised one-liners as singer Fat Amy, a cardio-averse, over-confident member of acapella group The Bellas.	3	3	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	Variety's review said the "picture belongs to Wilson," adding that the actress "fearlessly steps into yet another part that pokes fun at her figure, and happily reveals an outsized singing voice and hilarious dance moves to match."	4	4	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	Boxoffice Magazine wrote that Fat Amy "is the role that will turn her into a star," pointing out that Wilson is "hilariously, thrillingly crude" and "could very easily gobble up the film if she weren't such a generous ensemble performer."	4	4	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	Wilson has no qualms about making fun of her own figure.	1	2	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	"In comedy, you've got to use what you've got," Wilson told Reuters. "I'm not a size two, so of course I'm going to use that physicality to my advantage."	1	2	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	Weight maybe be a factor in her newfound Hollywood career but she is conscious about staying healthy.	1	2	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	"You need to have a lot of stamina to do this (job,)" she points out. "I try to be healthy. I train three days a week with a trainer. But I do like to eat, clearly. And I do eat dessert every day. If I cut that out, yes, I would lose weight."	1	2	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	At the moment, however, she has no plans to cut anything out and is enjoying breaking down barriers.	1	2	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	She recently finished shooting action comedy "Pain and Gain" directed by Michael Bay, a filmmaker known for working with models and directing commercials for Victoria's Secret.	1	1	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	"Guess what I wear in the movie? Victoria's Secret underwear - that's all I'm dressed in," said Wilson.	1	1	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	"I know I'm not the physical body type that he usually casts, but for some reason he likes me and thinks I'm funny, so maybe I'm changing his mind," she said of the director.	1	3	2			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	HALLUCINATION				I		
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	Wilson's physical stature was never something she thought would be a factor when it came to her career because she did not set out to be an actress.	1	1	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	She graduated from the University of New South Wales with a law degree and was a Rotary International youth ambassador for Australia, stationed in South Africa. While there, she contracted malaria, an event she called "life-changing."	1	1	3			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	"When I was in the hospital in intensive care, I had this hallucination that I was an actress and that I was really, really good, and that I won an Oscar," Wilson recalled.	1	3	3			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	She decided to make a career change. Unable to find acting work or an agent, she wrote and starred in her own play, "The Westie Monologues," which became a huge success in Sydney.	1	4	1			
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	That led to professional work on Australian television shows and she eventually came to the United States.

488	remarkable-rookie-colsaerts-saves-europe-shutout-004553957--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - Ryder Cup rookie Nicolas Colsaerts single-handedly saved Europe from being shut out in Friday afternoon's fourballs with a sensational round in what amounted to a duel with Tiger Woods.	3	3	2		4	
488	remarkable-rookie-colsaerts-saves-europe-shutout-004553957--golf	Colsaerts, the first Belgian to play in the Ryder Cup, got little help from his playing partner Lee Westwood but still carried the team to a one-up win over Woods and Steve Stricker, making eight birdies and an eagle.	1	3	2		4

488	remarkable-rookie-colsaerts-saves-europe-shutout-004553957--golf	It was a remarkable performance for a player who had fallen so far off form that he lost his European Tour card, then his regular status on the Challenge Tour.	3	3	3		4

489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	Report: Ohio nurse didn't realize she took kidney	1	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A nurse who accidentally disposed of a living donor's kidney during a transplant said she didn't realize it was in chilled, protective slush that she removed from an operating room, took down a hall to a dirty utility room and "flushed down a hopper," according to a report released by health officials on Monday.	2	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	The nurse said she had been on a break when a surgeon told everyone the kidney had been put in the sterile, semi-frozen solution.	2	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	That detail was in a review by the state for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and obtained by The Associated Press through a records request.	1	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	The transplant was Aug. 10 at the University of Toledo Medical Center.	1	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	Hospital administrative staff members interviewed on Aug. 21 hadn't determined how the nurse took the 13-gallon bag of slush, meant to extend the kidney's viability, past several members of the medical staff without them noticing a problem, the report said.	2	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	It said poor oversight and communication and insufficient policies were factors in the kidney's disposal, which prompted the voluntary, temporary suspension of the hospital's living-donor kidney transplant program and led to reviews by health officials and a consulting surgeon hired by the hospital.	2	1	2		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	The hospital, in northwest Ohio about 135 miles north of Columbus, "failed to provide adequate supervision and communication resulting in a donor's kidney being carried out of the operating room, down a hall, into a dirty utility room, and flushed down a hopper," the report stated.	2	1	2		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	The hospital has since enacted clearer policies to clarify communication between nurses who fill in for one another and to make sure nothing is removed from an operating room until the patient has been moved from it, the report said.	1	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	The surveyors determined the hospital wasn't in compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, conditions of participation for transplant and surgical services.	2	1	2		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	CMS will authorize a full review of the conditions of participation for the hospital, and, if it's found out of compliance, it could be terminated from the Medicare program, CMS spokeswoman Elizabeth Surgener said in an email.	1	1	2		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	The hospital, which says it offers specialty care in areas including cardiology, cancer, surgery and kidney transplantation, also may submit a plan of correction.	1	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	A spokesman said he had no comment to provide from the hospital Monday.	2	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	The hospital hasn't said what happened to the intended kidney recipient, who was supposed to receive an organ donated by her brother.	1	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	The intended recipient and her brother were released from the hospital, which didn't identify them and said it couldn't say whether she received a different kidney.	1	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	Hospital officials apologized and hired a Texas surgeon to evaluate their transplant procedures but have not released the results of that evaluation.	1	1	1		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	The medical center suspended two nurses after the incident; one was later fired, and the other resigned, the hospital said.	1	1	2		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	A surgeon was stripped of his title as director of some surgical services, and a surgical services administrator put on paid leave has resumed work.	1	1	2		4	
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	The hospital also notified 975 patients and potential organ donors and recipients that they might need to make other arrangements for services typically provided through the program under review.	1	1	1		4

490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	Republican study warns against bailout of state pensions	1	1	1		4	
490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	(Reuters) - State and local governments facing pension liabilities that already total in the trillions of dollar will be forced to seek bailouts from the U.S. government, Republican Party Congressional staffers said in a study released on Wednesday, as they warned that such bailouts could have dire consequences.	2	1	2		4	
490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	Republican staff of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee said with state debt topping $4 trillion, including $2.8 trillion in unfunded pension benefits and at least $627 billion for retiree health care, states may buckle under the pressure to raise taxes, cut spending and take other measures to pay off their debt.	3	1	2		4	
490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	"Despite the massive federal debt and fiscal imbalances, it will be hard for Washington policy makers to deny sympathetic retired teachers, police and firefighters after a previous Congress bailed out Wall Street and U.S. automakers," the Republican staff commentary said.	3	1	2		4	
490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	But it warned that any federal bailout would test the political fabric of the nation, citing the tensions in the European Union over the Greek bailout as a similar situation.	2	1	2		4	
490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	In a federal bailout, taxpayers in U.S. states now keeping up with their pension liabilities would be paying for states with the worst-funded public retirement systems, the study said.	2	1	2		4	
490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	Because of the difficulties faced in reforming public pension systems -- including union opposition to any reduction in pension and other benefits and the protections provided by law and even by state constitutions -- the study said that a different approach should be taken.	2	1	2		4	
490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	It recommended that the U.S. government reduce its potential aid to states in proportion to their unfunded liabilities until their pension funds become solvent over a specific time frame.	2	1	2		4	
490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	It also suggested that the ability of states to issue tax-free bonds could be revoked if their pension funds are expected to go broke within 10 years.	2	1	2		4	
490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	"As undesirable as a federal bailout of state pensions is, setting forth the terms and conditions of a potential bailout may be exactly what is needed to prevent one from happening," the study said.	2	1	2		4	
490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	"If the states understand how severe the terms of a federal bailout would be, they are more likely to take action now to fix their unsustainable pensions."	3	1	2		4

Maybe that's the point, though: to wear us down.	2	2	2		4

A guy doesn't just get shot in the face — we see the bullet enter his mouth and send blood spurting out his cheek through the screen in such deliberate, distinct fashion, you can practically count the drops.	2	3	1		4	
491	review-3-d-makes-beautifully-bleak-dredd-pop-032558453	Karl Urban stars as the stoic Judge Dredd, the baddest bad-ass of them all in a dystopian future where enforcers like him serve as judge, jury and executioner, right on the spot. Dredd is the most fearsome of the judges in the squalid, densely populated Mega City One, with his ever-present helmet and a low, monotone grumble that recalls both Christian Bale's Batman and Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name. He acts entirely with his mouth and his sheer intimidating presence. He gets no poignant origin story.	2	2	1		4

Her psychic abilities make her an asset when things get especially chaotic, and her slightly ethereal nature provides a welcome complement to Dredd's intense groundedness. She also serves as our emotional guide to a world that's essentially emotionless, aside from fear.	2	2	1		4	
491	review-3-d-makes-beautifully-bleak-dredd-pop-032558453	Dredd and Anderson respond to a gory triple homicide at the Peach Trees housing complex, a 200-story ghetto tower ruled from on high by the ruthless prostitute-turned-drug-lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey, her beautiful features disfigured by a severe facial scar). When the judges take one of her lieutenants into custody as a suspect (Wood Harris, best known as Avon Barksdale from "The Wire"), Ma-Ma puts the whole place on lockdown and insists she'll keep it that way until someone shoots the judges dead.	1	1	2		4

These moments make "Dredd 3D" stand out visually from so many other movies, whether they're action flicks or drug films. Oversaturated and finely detailed, the Slo-Mo sequences are mesmerizing for their richly colored and radiantly sparkling beauty — and again, Travis doesn't overdo them, which is key.	1	4	1		4

492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	NEW YORK (AP) — You almost have to admire the devilishly intricate dilemma Henrik Ibsen creates for his hero in "An Enemy of the People."	1	2	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	It's diabolical.	4	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Minute by minute, the pressure piles on the shoulders of Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a rather vain scientist who has discovered that the spa town of his birth is built on toxic water.	1	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Yet this well-intentioned whistleblower is put in an untenable spot, and eventually branded an enemy of the people.	3	2	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	A fine Manhattan Theatre Club's production that opened Thursday at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre starts shakily but ends as a full-throated defense of the individual.	3	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Boyd Gaines and Richard Thomas are marvelous as the battling brothers at the heart of the play, but there are terrific turns also by Gerry Bamman, Michael Siberry and Kathleen McNenny.	4	3	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Director Doug Hughes paces it like a thriller, with the heat rising steadily.	4	2	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	In his egotistical and naive way, Stockmann expects a parade in his honor when he finds proof that the baths in his 19th century Norwegian town are a health threat.	4	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	But the town depends on the tourists who flock to the baths and the mayor, who happens to be Stockmann's brother, is nonplussed by the science.	1	1	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Or is it sibling rivalry?	1	1	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	At first, Stockmann gets the support of the press — represented by journalist Hovstad (a complicated John Procaccino) — and the mainstream townsfolk — represented by a prominent citizen and printer Aslaksen (Bamman).	1	2	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	They want to use the issue to attack the town leaders.	1	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	But that plan disappears as soon as the mayor points out the economic disaster that closing the baths would entail.	1	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Public opinion, so fickle, has shifted, but Stockmann can't back down or compromise.	2	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	"I want to be able to look my sons in the eye when they grow up into free men," he says.	1	1	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Watching the pendulum swing from Stockmann in control to his brother getting the upper hand is a pleasure, with four-time Tony Award winner Gaines becoming increasingly despondent and wild, while Thomas plays his character with gleeful unctuousness.	4	3	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	McNenny, as Stockmann's wife (and Gaines' real-life wife), is fierce in a part that burns bright but for too short a time.	4	2	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Her character both appreciates her husband's sense of honor but also sees the disaster his lost income and exile would bring.	2	2	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	"I have truth and honor on my side," says Stockmann.	1	2	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	"What good are they when you have no power?"	1	1	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	she replies.				S	3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	But save for a few strong scenes, Ibsen puts Mrs. Stockman on the sidelines — a shame.	4	2	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	By now the townspeople have become a mob and that has given Hughes an opportunity to make his staging spill into the audience.	4	2	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	For Stockmann's courtroom-like defense of the exceptional individual over the ordinary throng, Hughes has gotten five actors to occupy the theater's first row and cheer and boo.	1	1	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	One is drunk.	1	1	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Democracy, Ibsen is saying, is a foul-mouthed mob.	1	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	The web of pressure relentlessly closes on Stockmann.	4	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	His father-in-law, who may be responsible for the toxins, gives him an ultimatum that affects his family's financial health, and the townsfolk approach the doctor again with a scheme to make money if he will only retract his findings.	1	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	His brother never relents: Blood, of course, proves less thick than sludge.	1	1	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	No matter, says Stockman, who keeps his sense of humor even as he fights to keep honest.	1	2	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	"They tore my best trousers," he says.	1	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	"The first lesson of freedom fighting, never wear your favorite trousers when you go out to fight for truth and justice."	1	1	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	The production benefits from John Lee Beatty's spare, unfussy sets and Catherine Zuber's striking costumes, particularly the black leather trench worn by Hovstad.	4	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	The palette here is plenty of grays, darks and muted colors — perfect for a grim look at morality.	4	2	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Other than the acting, there's little subtlety in this play, which often feels more like a lecture.	5	2	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Environmentalists will find a warning about global warming and libertarians may pull out an articulate defense of individualism.	2	1	2		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	But theater-goers without a political agenda get to watch a bunch of actors at the top of their game.	5	2	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	"The strongest man," says Stockmann at the rather overwrought conclusion.	1	1	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	"He's always alone."	1	1	1		3	
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	Not to be rude, but this great cast proves the opposite.	4	1	2		3

493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	I'd flip through the magazine each week to see what was on.	1	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	Keeping track of what to watch was pretty simple with only three main networks and a new one called Fox.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	Cable channels showed mostly reruns and old movies.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	There are a gazillion channels these days, including basic and premium cable channels with decent original series.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	Add to that all the content available through streaming, downloads and DVDs, and it can be challenging not to miss your favorite shows.	1	1	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	TV Guide's printed edition doesn't bother with full listings anymore.	2	1	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	That's where the new TV Guide app comes in.	1	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	Available for free for iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices, the app gives you a clean display of what's on TV over the next two weeks.	1	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	An Android version is coming this fall.	2	1	1		4

493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	You can create a Watchlist of your favorite shows, movies, actors and sports teams and see what's available on demand now or on television later.	2	2	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	The new app is more comprehensive than the guide on a digital-video recorder because it includes shows available on such services as Hulu, iTunes and Netflix, plus on-demand offerings through Xfinity for Comcast subscribers.	1	2	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	But it could be much more.	2	2	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	You start by creating an account and picking your television provider from a list.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	The listings are then customized according to what's available on your cable or satellite lineup (there's an "antenna" option on the list, too).	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	You can choose to display all channels, or create a list of favorites containing channels you watch most often.	2	1	1		4

493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	You can have the iPad do that for all episodes or just new ones —or just that particular showing.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	By hitting "I'll Watch," you can make that known on a social network such as Facebook or Twitter.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	Or you can add the show to your Watchlist.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	The Watchlist is the best part of the new app.	2	2	1		4

493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	Others are expected soon.	2	2	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	The Watchlist also shows the episodes you can buy and download from Apple's iTunes store.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	On my Watchlist, I saw that a handful of "Revenge" episodes were available for free on ABC.	2	2	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	Clicking on one took me right to ABC's app for viewing.	2	1	1		4

493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	With that feature, I learned of a show about a food truck competition on the Food Network.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	Beyond that, the app has news, photos and video on television and celebrities.	1	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	There were also special features, such as the fall television schedule at a glance and the Emmy nominees in key categories.	1	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	Unfortunately, the app was stingy when it came to giving me information on shows.	1	1	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	I clicked on "666 Park Avenue," hoping to get a description of the new ABC show.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	All I got was an option to add it to my Watchlist.	2	1	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	And that show about the food trucks?	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	I had to go to the TV Guide website on a computer to find out more.	2	1	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	As for the main listings, clicking on any program gets you a brief description, the kind you get in newspaper television guides or old printed editions of TV Guide magazine.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	You can add it to your Watchlist, request an alert or post it on a social network.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	That's it.	1	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	One feature TV Guide might consider adding: The ability to click on a link to get all the other episodes of that show, including those on streaming or DVDs, as well as the other times that particular episode would be repeated on TV.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	I'd also like to see a list of each show's key actors in the episode description, along with links to find out what other shows they appear in over the next two weeks.	2	2	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	Those features are available on TV Guide's website, but not on the app.	1	2	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	TV Guide plans to add some of these features to its app at some point.	2	2	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	To get it ready for the fall TV season, TV Guide says it had to focus on the features most requested, the ones most used on its website and those that might help it sell ads.	2	2	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	The TV Guide app beats checking static listings in a newspaper or the TV Guide Network on television.	1	2	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	In many respects, it also beats the TV Guide website, as it doesn't force me to get off my couch to find out what's on.	2	2	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	I can have the iPad right there, next to my remote control.	2	1	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	But it needs more to work as a personalized television guide.	1	1	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	The New Tonight section comes closest to offering that, but shows I said "I'll Watch" don't appear there, unless I've added them to my Watchlist as well.	2	1	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	Same goes for shows I've requested alerts for.	2	1	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	It's also limited to a few hours that night — not during the day, not the next night, not next weekend.	1	1	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	There also isn't a way to check off episodes I'd already watched, either on television or through streaming.	2	1	2		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	The TV Guide app is worth checking out, particularly for the way it brings together all aspects of television — the traditional channels, online streaming and episodes on DVDs.	2	2	1		4	
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	It can certainly help to organize your television life.	2	2	1		4

498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	(First, fourth, and fifth answers contain profanity)				I		
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - "Arbitrage," Nicholas Jarecki's indie drama about a high-powered New York hedge fund mogul (Richard Gere) enduring self-inflicted calamities on both personal and professional levels, opened on Friday and racked up exceptionally good business over its first three days. It grossed more than $2 million on fewer than 200 screens, the best-ever showing for a film that opened in theaters day-and-date with VOD.	3	3	3			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	One of the screenings that didn't go on the ledger took place at the Academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills on Saturday night, where the film played to a nearly full house and reportedly won a strong reaction from the Oscar voters in attendance.	3	3	1			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	Gere has never been nominated for an Oscar despite a 37-year career in film, and he's facing an uphill battle this year in a very crowded Best Actor category. But he's sly and quietly commanding as a wealthy trader whose world is on the verge of collapsing as a risky business deal goes bad and a midnight drive with his mistress turns deadly.	4	2	3			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	You don't work very often. Why did you do this film?	1	1	1			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	It's just a beautifully written script, beautifully structured. And it deals with a world that we all want to know more about. It's so relevant to our happiness, what those fuckers are doing.	4	4	2			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	And I liked the moral ambiguity of all of the characters, especially the character that I'm playing. The gradations of self-awareness, the empathy or lack of it.	3	3	2			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	We're conditioned to want to like the main character in a movie, but in the first few minutes "Arbitrage" gives us a laundry list of reasons why we shouldn't like this guy. Was it a challenge as an actor to keep us invested in him despite that?	2	1	3			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	I could have made the choice to play this character as more of a Bernie Madoff, or even darker. I mean, a real villain. But that wasn't interesting to me, or to Nick. It was too easy, and if I did that I don't think you'd be invested in him, as you say. Although you don't like what the guy does, you've gotta take the trip with him.	3	1	2			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	It's like with Bill Clinton. You know he's got problems, but he's our Clinton. It's like, "He's so lovable, he's so smart, he's cute, he's boyish ... " It was more important for me to get all the cylinders working on that part, as well as the machinations of what a Machiavellian guy in the financial world is capable of.	4	3	3			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	So Madoff and Clinton were the touchstones?	2	1	1			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	At the time we made this, Madoff was the elephant in the room. Since then, some characters have emerged who are more like this guy. Jamie Dimon is much more like this character than Madoff - he's a reputable, charming guy who just lost $9 billion of someone else's money.	3	3	3			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	And Ted Kennedy. Chappaquiddick. I thought, Wow, this is a really potent combination: power with flaws, big ideas. Really Shakespeare-sized stuff here.	3	3	3			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	A Shakespearean tragic hero, though, would end up dead. Your guy meets a much more ambiguous fate.	2	2	3			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	There was a certain faction, including the director, that thought this guy was fucked. We had arguments about that. They said, "His wife owns him, and that's it - she's gonna leave him and take everything." I said, "No fucking way." Look at where Clinton is today. That's the route he's gonna take: He's gonna rope-a-dope for a while. He's gonna take the punches and do his mea culpas.	4	3	4			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	Look, none of these people want to change their lives. is a woman totally invested in this guy and his world, and she loves him. Look at Hillary Clinton. She could have taken a totally different route, but I think she went with her heart. She said, "I love the guy, I know he messed up, but he's my Bill." And I think Susan's character will ultimately do the same thing.	3	4	1			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	The character has a sense of invulnerability, as do a lot of people in that position. There's a feeling that things can be screwed up, but there's a way out of this.	2	2	2			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	Absolutely. They're very confident: "I can make this work and I'm not going to lose." I spent time with those guys, and that's very much the mentality I wanted to feel on a visceral level. I see that with politicians, too.	3	3	1			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	I remember that I used to do this real cowboy stuff in Nevada. We would move horses from the north pasture, the summer pasture, to the winter pasture and back again. It'd be 10 days, and you'd be out there moving 150 horses. A lot of fun. But you hoped for that moment when one horse would take off, you know? We were all good at what we did, keeping the horses in line and moving along, but we were so happy when one horse said "fuck it" and ran. Because everyone could get crazy then: "Let's go get 'em, boys!"	3	4	2			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	I think that's part of the mentality. You never put it on the resume that you had a problem, but it gets your blood up.	3	2	1			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	How big a concern was it that the director had never directed before?	1	1				
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	Huge. But he knows this world, and he wrote that script, so I knew that he can tell stories. You make a bet.	3	2	1			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	Did his inexperience show during the shoot?	1	1	1			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	Sure. He didn't know exactly where to put the camera, he didn't know what lens, but he hired really good people who know how to do that. He didn't know how to talk to actors, because he'd never been through it before. And he couldn't really demonstrate to them, because he's not a good actor.	2	2	3			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	But he was good at keeping his energy up, and the stress level never buried him. It buries a lot of people.	2	2	2			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	Do you assume a slightly different role in a case like this? Slightly. I'm always involved anyhow, but here I was translating to actors what he wanted. I could help him say things in a way that would communicate to an actor, and not obfuscate. It's easy to confuse someone - an actor especially. So sometimes I was just the interpreter, saying, "This is what he means" in the native language.	1	2	2			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	You've talked about the tie between your character and politicians. What are your thoughts on the current campaign? I'm very happy that Obama's ahead. I'm pleased by that, and I will be voting for him, without a doubt.	3	3	1			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	Will you be campaigning or speaking out?	1	1	1			
498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	I don't think there's any need. It's not for me, it's for the president to tell the American people what he's going to do, and explain to them in a way that they'll feel it.	1	1	1

499	rick-perrys-campaign-imploded-4-revelations-133900010--election	Some political gaffes are so bad, so disqualifying, that they act like the "political equivalent of antibiotic-resistant bacteria" and simply kill a campaign, says Jay Root, a reporter for The Texas Tribune and author of the new e-book Oops! A Diary From the 2012 Campaign Trail. That's exactly the kind of blunder that Texas Gov. Rick Perry, once considered the frontrunner for the GOP nomination, committed on Nov. 9, 2011, when, during a primary debate, he tried to recall the three cabinet departments he would eliminate if he became president. "I would do away with the Education, the, uh, Commerce, and, let's see," Perry said, in the campaign's most agonizing 53 seconds. "I can't. The third one I can't. Sorry. Oops." That last word became the epitaph for Perry's doomed bid. How did it happen? Here, four revelations from the vantage point of a reporter covering Perry's campaign:	2	1	2		4	
499	rick-perrys-campaign-imploded-4-revelations-133900010--election	1. Perry got no sleep the night before his "oops"Root reveals that during the debate debacles, Perry "was just very sleepy," says Taylor Berman at Gawker. The candidate, who had undergone back surgery in July 2011, had painful sensations in his leg and foot that were keeping him up at night. As Root puts it, after the surgery sidelined him, he went from being a light sleeper to being an insomniac, and it showed. The morning before one debate the governor told his travel aide: "I didn't sleep a wink." A Florida GOP official who met the candidate during one commercial break told reporters she could tell he was in physical distress: "His hand was so cold, like ice. And he was sweating. I don't know what it was, but something was definitely wrong."	2	1	2		4

499	rick-perrys-campaign-imploded-4-revelations-133900010--election	2. Everyone was shocked by his disastrous debatesDuring one debate, Perry gave "a rambling, incoherent attack" in which he tried to accuse Mitt Romney of being a flip-flopper, says Connor Simpson at The Atlantic. Root says an ABC News reporter, Arlette Saenz, turned to him and asked, "Was he like this in Texas?" Root, often called on to provide similar perspective, was at a loss. "Honey, we're in uncharted waters," he told Saenz. "Behind the scenes, Perry's team was just as confused as anyone. Their guy was awful, and they knew it."	2	1	2		4	
499	rick-perrys-campaign-imploded-4-revelations-133900010--election	3. The belated diagnosis for Perry's fog: Sleep apneaArmchair medical experts chalked up Perry's mental lapses to painkillers prescribed after his back surgery, say Ashley Killough and Kevin Bohn at CNN, but the campaign maintained he had stopped taking them. Advisers called in sleep specialists, who diagnosed sleep apnea, Root says, a disorder affecting one in 10 men, causing "loud snoring and temporary lapses in breathing that disrupt normal sleep." Perry's doctors prescribed a breathing machine that pushes a constant flow of air through the breathing passages, which helped. "Perry, an exercise junkie, soon got back to normal once he was able to work out again." By then it was too late, Root says. "The narrative had already been set. He was becoming an afterthought."	2	1	2		4

499	rick-perrys-campaign-imploded-4-revelations-133900010--election	4. Perry was going down in flames — even without "oops"One thing Root's account makes clear, says Joe Holley at the Houston Chronicle, is that "even if Perry had slept like a baby for eight hours a night," he didn't stand a chance of acing a brutal, unforgiving presidential campaign. The "multitudinous gaffes" were just the tip of the iceberg. There was also "infighting and feuding at the top and the candidate's woeful ill-preparedness." Those factors alone "would have been enough to doom the campaign." The historically memorable "oops" moment "was merely the coup de grace."	2	1	2		4

505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax return and posted it online Friday, triggering a mad media dash to see what was inside.	2	1	1		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	(See the first page of the return below.)				i	4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	Romney and his wife, Ann, paid $1.95 million in taxes on investment income of $13.7 million last year (a significant dip from his 2010 haul of $20 million).	1	1	1		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	The GOP presidential nominee made his fortune running private equity firm Bain Capital from 1984 to 1999 (or 2001, depending on whom you ask), so his earnings now come from money he has invested.	2	1	1		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	That means he paid a lower tax rate — 14.1 percent — than workers pay on ordinary income from a paycheck.	1	1	1		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	What do the revelations say about Romney and his run for the presidency?	2	1	1		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	Here, four key takeaways:	1	1	1		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	1. Romney paid too much... busted!The "gotcha moment" here, says Derek Thompson at The Atlantic, is the revelation that Romney only deducted $2.25 million of his $4 million in charitable donations, or less than he was entitled to.	3	1	2		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	Why would he do that?	1	1	1		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	Because he'd sworn up and down that he never paid less than 13 percent of his income in taxes over the last decade, and if he had deducted every penny he was entitled to last year, he would have had an effective tax rate under 10 percent.	1	1	1		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	Pretty lame, as bombshells go, but liberals are chiding Mitt because he said he always pays what the law requires — no more, no less — and "if I had paid more [taxes] than are legally due I don't think I'd be qualified to become president."	3	1	2		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	Ha!	1	1	1		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	He paid too much but he said he didn't!	1	1	1	s	4

505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	For one thing, it's Friday, and it's a Washington tradition to dump news on topics you want hushed up when everyone's thinking about the coming weekend.	3	1	2		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	More importantly, Romney's '47 percent' secret-video comments already made him the loser on "the big political scoreboard" this week, and "political strategy 101 dictates that when things are going badly is the best time to dump other bad."	3	1	2		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	Besides, the first presidential debate is just two weeks away, and the longer he waited the more likely the returns were to become a big topic in his showdown with President Obama.	3	1	1		4

505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	The people who should be red-faced here are the ones responsible for the "needlessly complex" tax code that forces people to construct documents as thick as a phone book every time Uncle Sam demands his pound — or, in Romney's case, ton — of flesh.	4	1	2		4	
505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	Maybe instead of wasting time prying into Romney's personal tax history, which isn't really that important, we should be hounding him to release "the details of his plan to reform the U.S. tax code, which he has so far refused to specify."	4	1	1		4

506	romney-says-obama-trying-fool-voters-inaccurate-attacks-013006702--abc-news-politics	Romney's press conference came after a rough week for the candidate, and is the first sign of an attempt by the candidate to turn around the campaign, which is set to make stops in the battleground states of Colorado, Ohio and Virginia before the week's end.	3	2	2		4

506	romney-says-obama-trying-fool-voters-inaccurate-attacks-013006702--abc-news-politics	Romney said "nothing could be further from the truth" when Obama says he supported liquidating the auto industry.	3	1	3		4

507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	But polls are showing it's close, very close, and that Romney starts the fourth quarter slightly behind or dead even with a failed president.	2	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	The conventional wisdom is that social issues are the problem for the GOP coalition, but the truth is the conservative movement's bigger problem is that Americans are not nearly as libertarian as our party elites.	3	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Hence, the poor analyses of the political problems Romney faces.	3	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	What are Romney's fumbles?	1	1	1		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	The first was his convention speech.	1	1	1		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Romney's is the first speech in the history of conventions that mustered approval of less than half of Americans, according to Gallup.	2	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Just 38 percent called Romney's speech "good" or "excellent"; 10 percent said it was terrible.	2	2	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	The rest were simply unmoved, apparently.	2	1	1		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Why didn't Americans like the speech?	1	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Too much bio-fluff, too much blame -- and too little coherent case for how electing Romney president will get the economy moving.	3	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	When the most memorable line from a convention speech involves the daily red rose your long-dead mom received from your even-longer-dead dad, you've fumbled it.	4	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	The second Romney fumble was his blatantly hair-trigger political reaction to the murder of an American ambassador in Libya.	3	1	3		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Romney managed to make the first words out of his mouth as the jihadists attacked and killed a U.S. ambassador a criticism of the president of the United States.	3	1	3		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Memo to Romney campaign: In the middle of a firefight, Americans want our ammo aimed at the actual enemy, not a circular firefight.	4	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	He should have said, "My message to these immoral killers is: Americans stand as one against your futile and ugly hate," and left the critique of foreign policy until after the ambassador's body was buried.	4	1	3		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Romney's third fumble was the Romney campaign's decision to defend his stray comment about the "47 percent" -- to own it, to make it a campaign theme on the grounds it is technically "true."	3	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Memo to Romney campaign: Old people who've worked hard and paid taxes all their lives do not like being lumped with welfare moms as "moochers."	4	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	By doing so, Team Romney exacerbated what appears to be a growing liability on the Medicare issue.	3	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	In a New York Times/CBS poll, more than 75 percent of voters favor keeping Medicare the way it is.	1	2	1		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	A Times poll in the swing states of Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin found that about six in 10 voters say keep Medicare the way it is, and three-quarters of the likely voters in each of these states said Medicare is worth what it costs taxpayers.	1	2	1		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	The Washington Post reports that in the key swing state of Virginia, Obama has opened up a commanding 13-point lead among likely voters on the question of who they "trust to do a better job determining the future of the Medicare program."	1	1	1		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	We've learned in the last few weeks what we already knew: Romney is a weak candidate.	4	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	But it's not Romney alone: Conservative elites appear unaware of how thin the ice is around making Medicare "reform" a top issue.	3	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Older voters are the fastest-growing demographic in America.	1	1	1		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	They are natural GOP voters for traditional values -- unless you appear inordinately eager to reform the most popular social program in America.	3	1	1		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	If Romney doesn't rise to the top of his game, he may not be president.	3	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	It's the fourth quarter, but Romney's fumbles are keeping the game close.	2	1	1		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Only it's not a game.	3	1	2		4	
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	The future of the United States of America is at stake.	3	1	1		4

509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Harry's still finished, but don't rule out any return to the Potter world.	1	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	Although J.K. Rowling's first novel tailored for adults is being released this week, she says her next book will likely be a children's book, and in the future she may pen a story related to the Harry Potter universe.	2	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	"I think it very likely that the next thing I publish will be for kids.	3	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	I have a children's book that I really like, it's for slightly younger children than the Potter books," Rowling told the BBC in a television interview broadcast on Wednesday.	2	2	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	In one of a handful of appearances to promote "The Casual Vacancy," which hits bookstores worldwide on Thursday, Rowling told the BBC: "Truly, where Harry's story is concerned, I'm done.	2	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	Yet the 47-year-old best-selling British author did not rule out a Potter spin-off, while she was adamant it would never be for commercial reasons.	2	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	The seven "Harry Potter" books have sold more than 450 million books worldwide.	1	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	"I have always left the door ajar because I'm not that cruel.	2	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	If I had a fabulous idea that came out of that world, because I loved writing it, I would do it," she told the BBC.	3	2	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	"But I've got to have a great idea, I don't want to go mechanically into that world and pick up odds and ends and glue them together and say 'Here we go, we can sell this'.	3	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	It would make a mockery of what those books were to me."	3	1	2		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	Were that great idea to come, she said: "I probably would do it.	2	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	I'm very averse to the prequel/sequel idea.	2	1	2		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	I've never seen it work well in either literature or film.	2	1	2		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	That's a personal preference."	3	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	Rowling, who started her writing career as a financially struggling, single mother, said while there was clearly "an appetite for eight, nine, ten," Potter novels, she knew she only had enough plot for seven books about Harry's magical adventures.	3	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	"To go further would have been money for old rope.	3	1	2		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	Couldn't do it.	3	1	2		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	And that's largely why I slapped on that epilogue (in the final "Harry Potter" novel).	3	1	1		4

509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	Rowling said she would have liked more time to work on some of the books.	3	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	"I had to write on the run and there were times when it was really tough.	3	1	2		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	And I read them, and I think 'Oh God, maybe I'll go back and do a director's cut".	2	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	I don't know," she said in BBC interview.	3	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	"But you know what?" she added.	2	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	"I'm proud I was writing under the conditions under which I was writing.	4	2	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	No one will ever know how tough it was at times."	3	1	2		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	In a separate interview with ABC's "Nightline", Rowling revealed that she had signs of obsessive-compulsive behavior when she was a teenager, and that one of the characters in "The Casual Vacancy" was drawn from her own experiences.	3	1	2		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	"These are things I know from the inside," she said in the interview, some of which was aired on "Good Morning America" on Wednesday.	2	1	1		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	"When I was in my teens, I had issues with OCD ... checking things, it's very common, double checking, triple checking, it's an anxiety disorder."	3	1	2		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	Rowling has spoken openly in the past about dealing with depression, which she estimated she had not had to deal with for more than a decade.	2	1	2		4	
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	She credited Harry Potter with helping.	1	1	1		4

510	roy-lee-warner-bros-titans-writer-david-leslie-165656970	- "Wrath of the Titans" writer David Leslie Johnson is joining forces with producers Roy Lee and John Middleton of Vertigo Entertainment and Warner Bros.

511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	New Rules Could Give Oscar Documentary Field a Different Look This Year	1	1	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com)				I	4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	- Submissions for the Academy's Best Documentary Feature award have now closed, and a change in rules means the field of nominees could have a very different look this year	1	1	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	Bear in mind, it probably won't be different enough to include the year's top-grossing doc, "2016 Obama's America" - though it'd be the very definition of irony if that conservative film made the cut, since the new rules that could alter the Oscar doc landscape were spearheaded by Documentary Branch governor and famous liberal Michael Moore.	2	2	2		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	Under new rules proposed by Moore and passed by the branch and the Board of Governors last year, more members will be eligible to vote for the docs in the nominating process - and when their votes are tallied, it will be done using the preferential system, which often awards love-it-or-hate-it movies rather than the safer consensus favorites that prospered under the old system.	1	2	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	It could mean that the Academy will find room for more of the pop-culture or social docs that were often overlooked under the old system in favor of straightforward issue-oriented films; movies like "Searching for Sugar Man," "Paul Williams Still Alive," "Wish Me Away," "Marley," "Jiro Dreams of Sushi," "The Iran Job" and "The Queen of Versailles" might find it easier to get the needed support than they would have last year.	2	2	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	And "Samsara," the wordless and narrative-free doc that has done surprisingly well at the box office, seems tailor-made for the new rules - it's a thoroughly unconventional doc that could well be dismissed by a small committee, but might win enough passionate adherents in a larger body of voters.	3	2	2		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	It's also hard to imagine that harder-hitting docs that were overlooked in past years - Werner Herzog's "Into the Abyss" and Steve James' "The Interrupters" among them - wouldn't be able to garner enough support to at least move to the 15-film shortlist under the new system.	3	2	2		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	As to whether the new process will help 2012's three top-grossing docs, "2016 Obama's America," "Chimpanzee" and "Katy Perry: Part of Me" - well, that seems far-fetched, new system or not.	2	1	2		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	Nature films like "Chimpanzee" haven't been a typical part of the lineup for decades, concert films almost never get in, and while the anti-Obama movie has played well to conservative audiences (not exactly the Academy's constituency), few have accused it of being a quality piece of cinema.	3	2	2		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	We won't know how it all plays out until January, when the nominations are announced, or November, when the shortlist is revealed.	1	1	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	But while the initial reaction to the new rules was focused on the requirement that qualifying films receive a review in the New York Times or the Los Angeles Times, the controversy over that rule was something of a red herring.	1	2	3		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	In the long run, opening up the pool of voters and moving to the preferential count will likely have a bigger impact on the films that are nominated.	2	2	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	Here's how the major change works:	1	1	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	In the past, the first round of voting for the doc awards was in the hands of small screening committees.	1	1	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	These groups of volunteers from the branch would received a randomly-selected batch of DVDs, and would give each film a numerical score; the films with the 15 highest scores would move on to a shortlist.	1	1	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	Moore said that the committees could contain as few as five members, placing the fate of each film in the hands of an inordinately small number of members.	2	1	2		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	The new system does away with the committees and the scoring system.	2	1	2		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	Instead, all members of the branch, about 150, will receive screeners of all the eligible films (prepared and sent out at Academy expense), and will simply vote for their five favorites.	1	1	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	That brings the voting in line with most other Oscar categories - which also means that ballots in the category will be counted using the preferential system, a complicated process that sorts ballots by the film listed first, and then redistributes them round-by-round until only five films remain.	2	1	2		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	The preferential system places heavy weight on a voter's first choice and makes it far better to be passionately loved by a minority of voters than mildly liked by a majority.	2	1	2		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	A film that is ranked first on only 10 of the ballots will automatically make the 15-film shortlist, while a movie ranked third or fourth on 50 ballots may well be left off the list.	2	1	2		4

511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	As for what films might end up on the shortlist, a few titles stand out: Kirby Dick's devastating rape-in-the-military doc "The Invisible War," Lee Hirsch's powerful "Bully," Amy Berg's "West of Memphis" (which will have to face the hurdle of having a film on the same subject, "Paradise Lost 3," nominated last year), Alex Gibney's Catholic Church expose "Mea Maxima Culpa," David France's AIDS doc "How to Survive a Plague," Eugene Jarecki's drug-war doc "The House We Live In" and Malik Bendjelloul's tremendously entertaining "Searching for Sugar Man."	1	1	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	2012 docs that have grossed more than $1 million at the box office, in addition to "Sugar Man," "Bully," "Marley" and "Obama's America," include Lauren Greenfield's keenly-observed tale of excess among the super-rich, "The Queen of Versailles," and the Disney nature doc "Chimpanzee."	2	2	1		4

511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	Other possibilities include "Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry," "Beauty Is Embarrassing," "The Central Park Five," "Chasing Ice," "Detropia," "Escape Fire," "Ethel," "The Gatekeepers," "The Imposter," "Last Call at the Oasis," "The Law in These Parts," "One Day on Earth," "The Waiting Room" and the Keanu Reeves-produced "Side by Side," a series of conversations about the future of film in the digital age.	1	1	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	But it's hard to determine which films have qualified; many of the most acclaimed docs have screened on the film-festival circuit, which itself does not give a film the one-week Los Angeles and New York runs required to qualify.	1	1	2		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	Last year's field consisted of more than 100 documentaries.	1	1	1		4	
511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	This year's, which is expected to be slightly smaller under tightened qualifying rules, will be set by the number of films that submitted their paperwork by the end of the day on Monday, and completed their qualifying runs by the end of the year.	2	1	1		4

512	russian-tv-host-gets-2-million-back-govt-193933039	MOSCOW (AP) — A glamorous Russian TV host who has emerged as a face of anti-Kremlin protests has won an unlikely victory in her battle against the government by seeing the return of nearly $2 million seized by authorities.	3	2	1		4	
512	russian-tv-host-gets-2-million-back-govt-193933039	Russian investigators seized the cash during a search of Ksenia Sobchak's apartment in Moscow in June.	1	1	2		4	
512	russian-tv-host-gets-2-million-back-govt-193933039	Sobchak said she was keeping the money at home because she didn't trust Russian banks.	3	1	2		4	
512	russian-tv-host-gets-2-million-back-govt-193933039	The authorities action was widely seen as part of a crackdown on dissent that followed President Vladimir Putin's inauguration to a third term in May.	3	1	2		4	
512	russian-tv-host-gets-2-million-back-govt-193933039	Sobchak is the only daughter of St. Petersburg's late mayor, who was Putin's boss in the 1990s.	1	1	1		4	
512	russian-tv-host-gets-2-million-back-govt-193933039	Russia's top Investigative Committee said Thursday it sent the money back to Sobchak after seeing no evidence of tax dodging.	2	2	1		4

519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	A new TV ad in Florida harkens back to the notorious “death panel” falsehood.	3	1	2		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	It wrongly claims Medicare benefits could be “rationed” and seniors denied treatment by the new health care law.	3	1	3		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	In fact, the law specifically forbids rationing or restriction of benefits.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	American Crossroads, a super PAC launched with the help of Karl Rove, adviser to President George W. Bush, attacks Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in the ad, which features a gloomy gray-colored hospital bed with the word “rationed” in red capital letters resting on top of it.	2	1	2		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	The ad’s announcer says: “This is where seniors could find out their Medicare benefits have been rationed or don’t cover their treatments.”	1	1	3		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	The ad goes on to blame the so-called “rationing” on a board charged with recommending ways to slow the growth in Medicare spending.	1	1	2		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	It says this “unelected board” would “decide what gets covered here,” showing a hospital room again.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	But the law doesn’t establish any kind of board that would make decisions on what care seniors get as they’re waiting in hospital beds, or anywhere else.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	The ad reminds us of long-ago-debunked claims from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who first claimed the law would establish “death panels” that would decide who gets health care and who doesn’t.	3	1	3		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	Palin pointed to a provision that said Medicare would pay for voluntary counseling sessions for seniors to discuss end-of-life planning with health care professionals.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	She later pointed to the “unelected board” referenced in the American Crossroads ad.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	But the board, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, cannot, by law, “ration” care or determine which treatments Medicare covers.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	In fact, the IPAB is limited in what it can do to curb the growth of Medicare spending.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	It can’t restrict benefits or eligibility, increase premiums or taxes, or “ration” health care, according to the Affordable Care Act.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, page 490: The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1818, 1818A, or 1839, increase Medicare beneficiary costsharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	The Kaiser Family Foundation analysis said that the IPAB would be effectively restricted to finding savings from “Medicare Advantage, the Part D prescription drug program, skilled nursing facility, home health, dialysis, ambulance and ambulatory surgical center services, and durable medical equipment.”	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	The 15-member IPAB would make recommendations for cutting spending that could only be overridden with a three-fifths majority of both houses of Congress, or Congress could institute its own reductions of an equal amount to what the IPAB puts forth.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	So the ad gets a point for correctly saying the board’s recommendations “could go into effect without congressional approval.”	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	But that’s about the only bit of fact in yet another example of Mediscare in this election cycle.	2	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	The American Crossroads ad also calls the 15 members of the board “unelected bureaucrats.”	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	But as we’ve pointed out many times, the law says the members must include national health care experts, physicians and other health care professionals, economists, and representatives of consumers and seniors.	2	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	They’ll be appointed by the president with the “advice and consent of the Senate.”	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	The ad cites a July 13, 2011, article in The Hill newspaper as the source of its “rationed” claim.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	But The Hill’s article that day on the IPAB simply says that Republicans were claiming that the board would “ration care.”	2	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	The headline: “GOP aims for focused IPAB attack.”	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	An attack on the health care law wouldn’t be complete without the misleading claim that it’s “cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion.”	3	2	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	That’s a $700 billion reduction in the growth of spending over 10 years, and, if it happens, a necessary step to prolong the solvency of Medicare Part A, which covers payments to hospitals.	2	2	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	The ad wraps up its attack on Nelson by saying he “cast the deciding vote for Obamacare.”	2	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	Nelson did vote for the bill — but he wasn’t any more critical to its passage than any other senator.	3	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	And this isn’t the first time his vote has been given extra, and unwarranted, significance.	3	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	The conservative 60 Plus Association said Nelson cast “a deciding vote” in an ad that was launched in June.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	As we said then, it was another Nelson, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who was one of the last Democrats to say he’d vote for the bill.	1	1	1		4	
519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	Sen. Bill Nelson has pointed that out on his Facebook page.	1	1	1		4

520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	This spring, while with the Phillies in camp, I asked the clubhouse guy to get me some famous Phillies on balls for my charity auction. I must sign thousands every year for charity. It's funny how you get tired of the same requests over and over until you need one.	1	2	3			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	Anyway, I get 10 signed balls given to me in a box that I bring home. A few weeks later, I'm doing inventory on some items I have gotten for the auction and I open the box of balls and I can't read any of the signatures. I study and study, hoping to see a curve or a clue that would lead me to the name.	1	2	2			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	I asked my wife if she recognized any. None. I made out Roy Halladay, Jim Thome and Jimmy Rollins. A couple had the number — thank you Chase Utley, Ryan Howard, Cliff Lee and Hunter Pence. That was a great clue, at least for me, but what about the person who buys it at the auction and may not know the numbers?	1	2	2			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	Signatures became valuable on collectible items back in the 1980s. At least that's my recollection. The autograph itself has been a cherished item for as long as I can remember. I stood next to the players' field entrance at Crosley Field in Cincinnati as a kid in the '60s one night hoping to get Willie Mays. No such luck.	3	3	2			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	I have signatures I value, not because they are worth money, but because of how they were given to me.	2	3	1			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	As a kid, my grandmother was on a plane with Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. How that happened, I don't know, but she brought me all three of their names on business cards. The first says "Best Wishes, Gary Player." The next says "Good Luck Mike, Jack Nicklaus." The next is "To Mike, Best Wishes, Arnold Palmer." All say "Sept 11, 62," which I believe my grandmother wrote in the corner.	1	2	1			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	I was 12 years old in 1962. I'm looking at these cards now, I know all these men personally, have played golf with them, I know Player's and Nicklaus' kids. I was given the autographs 50 years ago of these famous golfers and I still have them. I can read them. You could read them. That's when an autograph was just that — a memory, an experience, something to look at that reminds you of good times.	1	4	1			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	I remember signing my first autograph in 1970. It was after the first game of the College World Series with Ohio University. We beat Southern California, and as we were boarding the bus a little kid had a ball and we all signed it. I thought it was the greatest thing, putting my signature on a baseball. The first of a zillion, every one of which can be recognized.	3	3	1			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	As most all of us who have taken advantage of our signatures having value, I have profited immensely from the memorabilia industry. Quite honestly, it has kept many of us from having to find a job after our careers ended, and for that we are thankful.	3	4	2			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	My signature's value has never changed over the years. Sure, I know there is a class system in the industry, certain signatures retain value and others don't. In my case, one reason it has retained value is it's neat and you can read it. It is legible, shows respect and looks as though I put some effort into the process of creating a collectible item.	3	3	2			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	I'm not in the class of Andre Dawson or the late Harmon Killebrew. Their signatures are artwork. Their slow, methodical signing technique shows immense respect for their names and the items on which they appear.	3	3	1			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	What's the point? The point is this generation and its athletes have allowed the autograph phenomenon to assimilate into a game, of sorts. Who will be where and when, and what scam do seekers need to run to take advantage of the moment? It's a game the fans and players play every day. Collectors using small children and pretty girlfriends to get sellable merchandise, hiding out at various locations with briefcases, planning their attack just to get a scribble.	2	1	3			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	No longer a handshake, smile and a short conversation and the personalized autograph that seals the memory. Now you get a scribble. And for some reason, fans accept it as normal.	1	2	2			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	So, I got my dozen balls for the charity auction. I was excited that those guys scribbled for me, but I had to put some sort of sign next to each ball so people would know who signed them.	1	3	1			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	Am I off base here, thinking that there is some link to one's level of respect for his signature as it relates to his respect for where it might be displayed? Or has the environment hardened the players to the point of not caring either way?	3	2	3			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	Don't be surprised if the future of those famous athletes' autographs is simply their uniform number. Why not? At least you can read it. And it suffices for proof that the fan and the athlete shared space. Actually, I think a stamp makes more sense. Think about it, conversations aren't part of it, handshakes either, why not a legible stamp? Bop, bop, bop — think how many more can be done in the same time, albeit the value of each one would certainly drop.	1	3	1			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	Probably too much to ask for a wholesale change in attitude from both sides. As if the players will sign neat and speak to the fans while signing, and fans and collectors will respect the player's right to privacy in certain areas and not stalk them near hotels and airports.	1	3	2			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	Autograph utopia: Neat signatures, kind words, handshakes, no pushing or shoving, quality opposed to quantity. Any chance?	3	4	2			
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	Me, I just want to know which Phillies signed those balls.	1	1	1

521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Health providers should screen all adults and pregnant women for risky drinking habits, a government-backed expert panel said Monday in new draft recommendations.	1	1	2		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines were released along with a summary of past research showing a few brief counseling sessions can help cut excessive drinking in people who aren't full-blown alcoholics.	1	2	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	Researchers found that with such interventions, at least one in every ten risky drinkers can be brought back down to what is considered a safe drinking level.	1	2	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	For men, that means no more than four drinks on any one occasion and at most 14 a week.	1	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	For women, the numbers are three and seven, respectively.	1	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	"The really good interventions incorporate self-help materials, they incorporate an action plan made by the doctor and the patient - they're not just a prescription," said Dr. Daniel Jonas of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who led the research review but is not part of the USPSTF.	2	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	It's estimated that about one in three Americans drink too much.	1	1	2		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	Most of the misuse is known as risky or hazardous drinking, which doesn't involve physical dependence or diseases, but nonetheless has been linked to accidents and premature deaths.	1	1	3		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	The new draft recommendations repeat the USPSTF's previous position from 2004, noting that the evidence is still insufficient to give advice regarding adolescents.	1	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	They are based on the research update from Jonas and colleagues, which included 23 trials of alcohol counseling; each trial had anywhere from 72 to more than 1,500 people and lasted from six to 48 months.	1	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	One of the most effective screening techniques is simply asking a person if he or she has had five or more drinks on any one occasion over the past year, said Jonas.	1	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	If the answer is yes, the health provider should gauge the level of misuse.	1	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	If it's limited to risky use, not yet causing direct physical or mental harm, then a few counseling sessions with the doctor can be helpful.	1	2	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	"The poster-child for these interventions was two visits with the primary care doctor, each one about 10 to 15 minutes and about a month apart and each one with a follow-up call from a nurse to reinforce the behavior," Jonas told Reuters Health.	2	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	He and his colleagues found such interventions cut the average weekly alcohol use by 3.6 drinks on average compared with no intervention.	1	2	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	They also reduced binge drinking by 12 percentage points and risky drinking by 11 percentage points.	1	2	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	That means nine people would need to be counseled for one to cut back to safe drinking levels.	1	2	2		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	And that might even be an underestimate of the true benefit of counseling, said Jonas.	2	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	That's because even people who didn't get counseling had been screened, making them aware they drank too much and possibly leading them to cut back.	2	2	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	Screening and counseling has little potential to do harm, according to the researcher.	1	2	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	Still, there is no proof that drinking less actually leads to fewer accidents or deaths, which is why the task force gave the recommendation a grade "B" instead of a "A."	1	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	Jonas acknowledged that with about a fifth of Americans being "risky drinkers," a universal screening program could be pricey.	2	1	2		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	While Medicare reimburses doctors for it, it's time out of the calendar for both patients and health providers.	2	1	2		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	"That is really the biggest challenge with implementing this," Jonas said, adding that UNC is in the process of training its doctors to do the screening.	2	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	"Training is a big piece of it too, because a lot of providers need to learn how to do it," the researcher said.	2	1	1		4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	The USPSTF's draft guidelines are open for public comments until October 22.	1	1	1		4

522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Sea Creatures in a Warming World: Winners and Losers	1	2	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	MONTEREY, Calif.	1	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	— The world's oceans are getting more acidic, a phenomenon predicted to wreak havoc on most sea life.	2	1	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	But some organisms are performing better in these caustic conditions than researchers had anticipated, raising questions about what the oceans will look like in the future.	2	2	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	"We know evolution can occur on relatively short ecological timescales," said Gretchen Hofmann, a biologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, at the Third International Symposium on the Oceans in a High CO2 World meeting last week.	2	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	She added that the big remaining question is which species will survive, and which won't be able to cope.	2	1	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	As carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere (as a result of burning fossil fuels), about a quarter of that atmospheric carbon makes its way into the oceans, where it dissolves and makes the waters more acidic.	1	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Currently, because of this process, the oceans are about 30 percent more acidic than they were at the start of the industrial revolution.	1	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Species that make shells out of calcium carbonate are particularly compromised in acidic waters, where the carbonate ions needed for shell-making are not available.	1	1	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	But other ocean-dwellers that rely on protein instead of calcium carbonate to create shells fare better.	1	2	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	For instance, small crablike arthropods about the size of sand fleas actually increase productivity in extremely acidified water, said Kristy Kroeker, a biology doctoral student at Stanford University.	1	2	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	"These are rapidly growing, small-bodied creatures with larvae that crawl instead of swim, and they actually do very well," Kroeker told LiveScience.	1	2	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	[Spectacular Photos of Sea Creatures]	2	2	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Hofmann's lab has found that purple sea urchins are able to cope with highly acidic waters, probably because of the amount of genetic diversity within the species.	2	2	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	The group collected sea urchins from a spot off the Oregon coast that has naturally high acidity from the upwelling of deep ocean water.	1	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	In the lab, the researchers compared the genetic data of these urchins when raised at high-acidity and normal-acidity conditions, finding 150 genes turned on that helped the urchins move calcium around their systems.	1	2	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	In addition to urchins, some corals tolerate the changing oceans better than others.	1	2	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Katharina Fabricius, a coral reef ecologist with the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said that colorful branching coral can't cope with higher temperatures and ocean acidity, but massive boulder corals and sea grasses survived in these conditions.	1	2	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Fabricius has worked in Papua New Guinea, along vents that bubble carbon dioxide into shallow water, giving a good experimental lab to researchers looking at future ocean conditions.	1	2	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	[Photos of Colorful Corals]	1	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Her research suggests these reefs will still exist in 100 years.	2	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	"But they would be much more simple.	2	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	The complex species are unable to deal with high carbon dioxide situations," she said.	1	1	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Reefs are hope to hundreds of thousands of species, and replacing the branching coral — with its myriad nooks and crannies for habitat — with boulder coral means a drop in biodiversity.	2	2	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	"If you don't have the structure, you don't have the habitat," Fabricius said.	1	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Other parts of the world share a similar story.	1	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Kroeker works in carbon-dioxide-bubbling vents off the coast of Italy.	1	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	As waters become more acidic there, Kroeker explained, fewer patches of bright orange-and-pink algae can survive.	1	1	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	"Instead, we see lots of fleshy seaweed.	1	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	It looks like a dark mat on the seafloor."	2	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Kroeker’s 2010 meta-analysis detailed in the journal Ecology Letters also showed that crustaceans generally do better than other calcium-carbonate shell-making creatures.	2	2	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Some lobsters, prawns and crabs actually increase their shell-building when faced with more acidic waters.	1	2	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Even different algae species differ in their responses to ocean acidification.	1	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Dave Hutchins, a marine biologist at UCLA, said that harmful algae blooms like those that cause red tides are likely to produce more toxins in future ocean conditions.	2	1	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	"These blooms cost around $100 million per year in the U.S. alone, and may get more toxic in the future," Hutchins told LiveScience, adding that they're a special problem on the West Coast; sea lions washing up around the LA area were poisoned by algae called Pseudo-nitzschia that produce a powerful neurotoxin that leads to memory loss, nerve damage and death.	2	1	3		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	A group of cyanobacteria called Trichodesmium that turn atmospheric nitrogen into a form other organisms can use for growth are also winners.	1	2	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	His lab has looked at hundreds of generations of algae, and found that they produce far more nitrogen in high carbon-dioxide (CO2) conditions.	2	1	1		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	"For hundreds of generations, we grow them under lab conditions, and their production of nitrogen goes way up under high CO2," he said.	2	1	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Hutchins said he also found the algae couldn't scale back their nitrogen production, even when the carbon dioxide level drops.	1	1	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	"They're stuck in an 'on' position, and we're trying to understand what that means in terms of marine food chains," he said.	2	1	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	Ocean acidification also interferes with some fish's ability to sense predators.	1	1	2		3	
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	One bit of research presented at the conference showed that juvenile clownfish lost their ability to sniff out predators in high carbon-dioxide environments.	1	1	2		3	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	What Sea-Ice Loss Means for Development in the Arctic	1	1	2		4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	NEW YORK — Arctic sea-ice extent shrank to an unprecedented low this summer, part of a long-term decline in the icy white cap over the far northern ocean.	1	1	2		4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	Researchers predict that nearly ice-free summers are on the way, although it’s not yet clear when this will happen. This shift has implications for climate — in particular, it is expected to aggravate global warming — and for the animals, such as polar bears and walruses, which depend on the ice for habitat.	1	1	2		4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	But the loss of ice over the Arctic Ocean also opens up the possibility for increased shipping, tourism, oil and gas exploration, and fishing. But this potential development raises challenges with which nations will have to grapple, said Anne Siders, a postdoctoral researcher with the Columbia Center for Climate Change Law, to an audience at Columbia University Wednesday (Sept. 19).	1	1	2		4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	Siders was among a panel of researchers who discussed the science behind the declining sea ice, the suite of changes occurring in the Arctic and public perception of it. [10 Things You Need to Know About Arctic Sea Ice]	1	1	2	S	4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	A predictably open Arctic Ocean creates opportunities and challenges for nations that ring the Arctic. Here are some of them.	1	1	1		4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	The opportunities:	1	2	1		4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	Fishing: Warming ocean temperatures, migrating fish and changes in sea ice may create conditions favorable to the development of new commercial fisheries within the Arctic, according to the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A U.S. plan, approved in 2009, temporarily prohibits commercial fishing in U.S. Arctic waters until more information is available.	1	2	2		4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	More ship traffic: A journey through the Northwest Passage north of Canada or along the Northern sea route over Russia can cut thousands of miles off a trip that could otherwise require a ship to travel through the Panama Canal or the Suez Canal. Between 1906 and 2006, only 69 ships traveled through the Northwest Passage, said Michael Byers, professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, in a recent article in the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. In 2010, 18 traveled through, and in 2011, 22 made the trip. As ice in the passage has dwindled, tourist trips on cruise ships and private yachts has increased, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reports.	1	1	1		4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	Gas and oil: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in 2008 that the Arctic holds a wealth of undiscovered energy reserves: 90 billion of barrels of oil, 1,670 trillion cubic feet (47.3 trillion cubic meters) of natural gas, and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids —most of it offshore. The quest for these resources is underway, in spite of setbacks. The oil company Shell announced on Monday(Sept. 17) it was delaying until next year plans to drill off the Alaskan Arctic coast. The loss of ice would make this prospecting easier.	1	2	1		4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	The problems:	1	1	2		4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	Inadequate maps: The increase in traffic brings up a navigation problem. NOAA's maps and other navigational information are unavailable or outdated in parts of the Arctic Ocean, because thick, impenetrable sea ice kept ships out. In addition, most Arctic waters that are charted were surveyed using obsolete technology dating back to the 1800s, according to NOAA.	1	1	2		4	
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	Little infrastructure or support: Alaska has twice the length of coastline as the lower 48 states, but the U.S. Coast Guard has extremely limited resources to devote to search-and-rescue operations or to oil spill cleanup, Siders said. Admiral Robert Papp, the Coast Guard commandant, has been quoted in the media as saying, "The Coast Guard has zero capability in the Arctic. … If we are going to have a permanent presence there, it's going to require some investment. We don't have the infrastructure in place right now." As an example of when things go wrong: In 2010, a cruise ship called the MV Clipper Adventurer ran aground in the Northwest Passage, and its passengers had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard.

523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	Territorial disagreements: The Arctic coastal nations, the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway and Denmark (Greenland is a Danish territory) are seeking to lay claim to territory far out over the continental shelves, but the United States can't lay its own claim and has little say in others’ because the U.S. is not a party to the U.N. Law of the Sea Treaty, CNN Money reports. There are other territorial issues as well, for instance, Canada maintains that the Northwest Passage is sovereign Canadian territory, while other nations, including the U.S., maintain that it is an international strait.	1	1	2		4

524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	OLYMPIA, Washington (Reuters) - The Seattle City Council on Monday voted 6-2 in favor of an arena financing deal with hedge fund manager and aspiring NBA franchise owner Chris Hansen that aims to lure the NBA back to the city.	3	3	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	The Pacific Northwest city lost the Seattle SuperSonics to Oklahoma City in 2008, where the team was renamed the Thunder, after the owner faulted city officials for not coming up with a plan to build a new arena.	3	1	2		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	The team's departure after four decades in Seattle angered basketball fans in the city, and officials are trying to bring back the National Basketball Association to town.	3	2	2		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	"This is about a can-do spirit, looking to the future and grabbing the opportunities that are being presented to our city," said Councilman Tim Burgess, who voted in favor of the financing deal.	4	3	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	The arena deal builds on a memorandum of understanding struck in May to require an outlay of up to $200 million in public bonds to help pay for the $490 million project.	1	1	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	That agreement was struck between hedge fund manager Chris Hansen, Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and King County Executive Dow Constantine.	1	1	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	The public bonds would be repaid by taxes and rent payments generated from the arena.	1	1	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	"This may set a new bar for deals that cities strike with pro sports teams," said Seattle City Council President Sally J. Clark, who voted in favor of the agreement.	2	2	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	The two council members voting against the deal acknowledged that their colleagues had extracted relatively favorable terms from Hansen and his partners but said that it was not enough.	2	1	2		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	"This revised agreement may prevent the most problematic outcomes," said Councilman Richard Conlin.	2	2	2		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	"That does not mean that we will wind up benefiting from it or that it is a good use of the city's time, resources or financial capacity."	3	1	2		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	The King County Council still needs to sign off on the deal before Hansen can begin shopping for a team.	2	2	2		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	In a statement, King County Councilman Joe McDermott said the county body was likely to do so soon.	1	2	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	"I am certain we will stand together with a final in the next few weeks," McDermott said.	3	3	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	Under the agreement, Seattle officials would create a $40 million transportation fund to help offset traffic congestion in the area that could worsen with the new arena.	2	3	2		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	The new terms also include at least $2 million to spruce up the SuperSonics' old home, Key Arena, up to $5 million to help pay the rent for the WNBA's Seattle Storm should they wind up playing in the new arena, and a personal financial guarantee from Hansen on paying off the arena debt.	2	2	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	Hansen could also be required to buy the new arena for $200 million after 30 years.	1	1	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	The deal is contingent on an environmental assessment of the project that will include an exploration of alternate sites.	1	1	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	Hansen has spent millions of dollars acquiring land near downtown for the proposed arena close to the stadiums of the Seattle Mariners baseball team and the NFL's Seattle Seahawks.	1	1	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	Hansen's plan calls for having teams from both the NBA and the National Hockey League play in the new arena, but ground could be broken on the project for an NBA team alone.	1	2	2		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	"This is a magical day and a long time coming," said Kris Brannon, one of a handful of diehard green- and yellow-clad SuperSonics fans that cheered and hugged in the City Council chambers after the votes were tallied.	3	2	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	The NBA franchise most often linked in media reports with a possible move to Seattle is the Sacramento Kings.	1	1	1		4	
524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	The team previously expressed an interest in moving to Anaheim in southern California.	1	1	1		4

525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	NAIROBI (Reuters) - A Kenyan junior minister was charged in court on Thursday with hate speech and inciting violence after calling on members of a tribe to leave a neighborhood in the capital Nairobi.	1	1	3		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Ferdinand Waititu is the second minister to be charged with inciting violence in two weeks, raising fears some politicians are still bent on stoking unrest for political gain ahead of a March presidential election.	1	1	2		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	The prosecution told the court the assistant minister for water had said words "calculated to bring violence to members of the Maasai community living and working in Kayole," a densely-populated neighborhood in his Nairobi constituency of Embakasi.	1	1	2		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Waititu told the Maasai to leave the area on Monday after Maasai guards battered a street boy to death.	2	1	3		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	He said: "We do not want to see members of the Maasai in Kayole from today," according to the prosecution.	2	1	2		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Two people were killed in fighting that broke out after Waititu's comments.	1	1	3		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Police are investigating whether the violence was linked to his remarks.	1	1	2		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Waititu was suspended from ministerial duties until the court case was concluded, President Mwai Kibaki's office said in a statement.	2	1	1		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Next year's vote will be the first since the International Criminal Court launched cases against four Kenyans, including two presidential contenders in the 2013 election, over accusations they masterminded tribal violence that killed more than 1,200 people following a disputed 2007 poll.	1	1	3		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Elections have traditionally been flashpoints of unrest in a country where political allegiances tend to be based on tribal loyalties rather than political ideology.	2	1	2		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Many Kenyans are wary of repeat clashes next year and a reconciliation body set up after the last bout of post-election violence has urged politicians to refrain from making inflammatory remarks.	2	1	2		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Mzalendo Kibunjia, who chairs the National Cohesion and Integration Commission in Kenya, said he hoped the judicial case against Waititu would deter other politicians from stoking unrest.	2	1	2		4

525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	You had better learn new tricks of political mobilization," he told Reuters.	2	1	1		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Waititu, a political ally of deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta who is one of the four facing crimes against humanity charges at the International Criminal Court, was remanded in custody until the court decided whether to grant bail.	1	1	1		4

525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Waititu, from Kenya's Kikuyu group, apologized for his remarks which he called a "slip of the tongue" but failed to stop the prosecutor pressing charges, a move broadly supported by a public tired with politicians showing little regard for the law.	2	1	2		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Earlier this month, President Mwai Kibaki sacked Assistant Livestock Minister Dhadho Godana who was accused of inciting violence in a dispute over land and water in Kenya's coastal region in which over 100 people have been killed.	1	1	3		4	
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	Godana pleaded not guilty and was released on bail.	1	1	1		4

528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	Senate considers political polar bear bill	1	2	2		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	WASHINGTON (AP) — On its last day in session before the election, the Senate tied itself in knots over 41 polar bear carcasses that hunters want to bring home from Canada as big game trophies.	3	2	3		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	After punting tough decisions on far weightier issues like raising taxes and cutting spending, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., insisted that the Senate address the wide-ranging sportsmen's bill before voting on must-pass legislation to prevent the government from shutting down at the end of next week.	4	2	4		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	Republicans resisted for a while Friday, contending the only reason Reid wanted the vote now on the bill long sought by hunters and sport fishermen was to benefit Democratic incumbent Jon Tester 's re-election prospects in a tossup race in Montana that could determine which party runs the Senate next year.	2	3	2		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	"This isn't a campaign studio, It's the Senate," Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., complained on the Senate floor Friday.	1	1	2		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	"We've got responsibilities to meet.	1	2	1		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	Let's meet them.	1	2	1		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	And leave the politics out of it for once."	1	1	2		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	The House had passed a similar bill in April that was co-sponsored by Rep. Denny Rehberg, Tester's Republican opponent in the Montana Senate race.	1	2	2		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	In the end, Tester would get only a test vote as the Senate, yet again, punted another issue until after the election.	2	2	2		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	Tester's bill combines 19 measures favorable to outdoorsmen.	2	1	2		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	In addition to dealing with the polar bear hides, it would allow more hunting and fishing on federal lands, let bow hunters cross federal land where hunting isn't allowed, encourage federal land agencies to cooperate with state and local authorities to maintain shooting ranges, exclude ammunition and tackle from federal environmental laws that regulate lead, boost fish populations and protect animal habitat.	3	4	3		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	Tester suggested that Friday's compromise allowing for a test vote but delaying a final one exemplifies why Congress has such a poor approval rating from voters.	2	2	3		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	"That might take some of the politics out of it and if we ever made a decision here without politics it would be an earth shattering day," Tester said.	1	1	2		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	"This bill right here is a prime example of what is wrong in Washington, D.C. — it's being held up for no reason whatsoever."	1	1	3		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	The polar bear provision would allow the 41 hunters —including two in Montana — who killed polar bears in Canada just before a 2008 ban on polar bear trophy imports took effect to bring the bears' bodies across the border.	2	2	3		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	The hunters involved were not able to bring the trophies home before the Fish and Wildlife Services listed them as a threatened species.	1	2	2		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	Tester said it would just allow a few people who have polar bear trophies stored in Canada to finally bring them home.	1	2	1		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	"These polar bears are dead, they are in cold storage and we know exactly who they are," he said.	1	1	3		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	Michael Markarian of The Humane Society of the United States criticized the measure.	1	1	2		3	
528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	"The cumulative impacts of incentivizing this killing over and over again are contrary to American conservation law," he said.	1	1	3		3

529	sequel-kings-novel-shining-due-september-2013-150441005	In the sequel, Dan Torrance, no longer a boy but a middle-aged man, is still haunted by his father's legacy and the horrific childhood year he spent at the Overlook Hotel, according to a synopsis of the book posted on the website.	1	1	2		4	
529	sequel-kings-novel-shining-due-september-2013-150441005	He uses his gift - the shining - to comfort the dying in a New Hampshire town but his life is upset when he meets a 12-year-old girl who also has the shining and whom he "must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals," the website said.	1	2	2		4

530	serb-acquitted-setting-fire-us-embassy-181342272	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — A Serbian court on Thursday acquitted the prime suspect charged with setting fire to the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade in 2008, but convicted him of the lesser offense of stealing property from the building and sentenced him to a year in prison.	1	2	2		4	
530	serb-acquitted-setting-fire-us-embassy-181342272	A Belgrade high court judge said there was no evidence that Milan Zivanovic, 24, took part in the burning of the embassy when Serb rioters stormed it on Feb. 21, 2008, in anger over Washington's support for the statehood of Kosovo, the predominantly ethnic Albanian province that had declared independence from Serbia.	1	1	2		4	
530	serb-acquitted-setting-fire-us-embassy-181342272	But the judge said Zivanovic, a university student, took part in the stealing of a leather jacket and gloves that belonged to an embassy employee. One assailant was killed in the fire set by the attackers.	1	1	3		4	
530	serb-acquitted-setting-fire-us-embassy-181342272	Apparently unhappy with the verdict, the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade said in a statement that it "will continue to monitor the course of appeals in this case, especially on the more serious charge of which the defendant was acquitted by the court. " It said: "We stress that it is important to pursue justice against all those, including those in authority, who ordered or otherwise supported this egregious violation."	2	1	2		4	
530	serb-acquitted-setting-fire-us-embassy-181342272	Zivanovic's lawyer, Bane Janev, said he is satisfied with the verdict, claiming his client was driven to attack the embassy "by a strong sense of patriotism."	2	1	2		4	
530	serb-acquitted-setting-fire-us-embassy-181342272	The attackers, mostly soccer hooligans, threw stones and flares at the embassy building, breaking windows and setting it on fire. The extremists also attacked other Western embassies in the Serbian capital.	1	1	2		4	
530	serb-acquitted-setting-fire-us-embassy-181342272	The incident caused tensions in U.S.-Serbia relations and triggered calls by American officials to bring to justice more perpetrators of the attack. Serbian authorities earlier this year charged another 14 people for the violence.	1	1	2		4	
530	serb-acquitted-setting-fire-us-embassy-181342272	Serbia lost control over Kosovo after a 1998-99 war but has refused to recognize its independence. About 10,000 people died during the conflict, which ended after NATO bombed Serbia to force it to stop the bloodshed.	1	1	2		4

531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	Despite a drop in the number of validated physical child abuse cases in the U.S., there’s been a slight increase in serious injuries due to child abuse. If the numbers don’t match up, what’s going on?	3	2	4			
531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	The findings, published online in a study in the journal Pediatrics, worry some that the discrepancy may reflect changes in how cases are reported to child agencies and not indicative of a true downturn in cases of child abuse.	1	1	3			
531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	Researchers from the Yale School of Medicine found that data from child protective services in the U.S. showed a 55 percent decline in verified cases of physical child abuse from 1992 to 2009 in the U.S. However, that data didn’t include the number of children who were hospitalized with significant injuries due to child abuse.	3	3	4

531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	But examining information from the Kids’ Inpatient Database, a group of pediatric hospital inpatient records, revealed a different story. Incidents of serious physical child abuse cases from 1997 to 2009 went up 4.9 percent. Cases included head injuries, fractures, abdominal injuries, burns and fractures.	1	1	5			
531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	Lead author Dr. John Leventhal said in a news release that the varying numbers demonstrate the difficulty of using one source to get a handle on something like child abuse and the importance of developing useful prevention programs.	1	1	3			
531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	“These results highlight the challenges of helping parents do better by their children and the importance of effective prevention programs to reduce serious abusive injuries in young children,” he said.	3	2	3			
531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	Leventhal expanded on the reasons behind the discrepancy in a Reuters story: It may be more difficult now for child protective services to verify abuse allegations, and parents may be under more stress due to finances, causing them to take their stress and anger out on their children.	1	1	3			
531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	MORE: Parents Get Physical With Their Kids in Public More Often than They May Admit				I		
531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	A study in Pediatrics in July found a parallel rise among home foreclosure rates and reported cases of child abuse and head injuries.	1	1	4			
531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	Babies, Leventhal told Reuters, may be especially vulnerable to abuse. In the study, the increase in incidence of abuse among children under one year of age went up 10.9 percent.	2	1	4			
531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	"Infants tend to be hospitalized at a much higher rate than older children, and I think it's because the injuries they sustain are much more serious," he said.	3	1	3			
531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	How can agencies that protect children do a better job of reporting child abuse? Let us know in the comments.	3	2	2

534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Sign of the times _ baseball autographs go hi tech	1	1	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Jim Nash is such a big Yankees fan that he named his son George Mattingly Nash, combining two of his favorite players: George Herman Ruth and Don Mattingly.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	So when he noticed Mattingly was participating in a startup venture called Egraphs, which offered an autographed digital picture with a handwritten note and a personalized audio message, he didn't think twice about paying $50. Nash never would have walked up to the Los Angeles Dodgers manager and asked for his signature.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	"It's much easier, especially for a grown man," the West Virginia native said. "It's much more personal."	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Egraphs launched at the All-Star break, a technological breakthrough that extends the autograph business from the age-old methods of writing to stars, leaning across ballpark railings and hanging around hotel lobbies.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Now, power up the computer and get a prize from the likes of R.A. Dickey, Cliff Lee, Andrew McCutchen and Clayton Kershaw. Or even retired stars that include Pedro Martinez.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	"It's actually kind of cool. It's like new age for me," Mattingly said.	2	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	David Auld, a former Microsoft employee who is the Seattle-based company's chief executive officer, started the venture last October and brought in former major leaguer Gabe Kapler as director of business development. Kapler was contacted by Auld's brother, Brian, the senior vice president of business operations for the Tampa Bay Rays, Kapler's team from 2009-10.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	"Taking the cold out of the autograph experience with the celebrity made a lot of sense," Kapler said.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	In an era in which players carry iPads and wireless has become more ever-present in clubhouses than smokeless tobacco, the idea seems to have caught on rather quickly. Among the early players to sign up were Tampa Bay's David Price and manager Joe Maddon.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	The company's website, www.egraphs.com, lists about 130 players, with several sold out — including David Ortiz, Josh Hamilton, Prince Fielder and CC Sabathia.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Prices range from $25 to $100, depending on the player.	1	1	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	For the players, the process is relatively easy and speedy.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	"We built a custom iPad application," said David Auld, who used engineers he knew from high school. "They record an audio message through the iPad microphone."	1	1	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Consumers can share their Egraph on social networks and purchase a framed print with a certificate of authenticity. Each signature and recording is biometrically verified.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	"It's cool. The best part of that is the audio," said New York Mets 20-game winner R.A. Dickey. "I get to give an audio message to a fan, which is pretty neat."	2	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Each of Dickey's messages is different.	1	1	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	"It all depends on the note that they write and what they share," he said.	2	1	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Among the audio messages thus far, St. Louis first baseman Matt Carpenter told a fan named Laura "if it wasn't for sugar-free vanilla pudding, I'd have no chance in the big leagues! Thanks for all your support — and Go Cards!"	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	And Texas slugger Hamilton recorded this for a fan named Nancy: "Glad to hear you are doing well from the cancer. Cancer has been very prevalent in my family so my prayers go out to you and your family as well. Praying for good health and long life and a long time coming to Rangers' games. Best wishes and God bless."	1	2	2		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	To make sure that the idea couldn't be copied within the sport, Egraphs obtained exclusive licenses with Major League Baseball and with Major League Baseball Advanced Media, its Internet division.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Howard Smith, MLB's senior vice president of licensing, was impressed when he listened to Auld's pitch.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	"Every month I get a really cool idea and say, 'How are you going to do that?'" explained Smith, entering his 15th year with the commissioner's office. "The technology they have in terms of safeguarding for the athlete, in terms of merchandizing, it has extensions well beyond this, well beyond autographs, well beyond licensed products."	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Auld won't divulge the volume of the company's sales. Kapler envisions an expansion to musicians and hopes for the day when Mariah Carey can send audio birthday greetings to fans. Auld sees minor leaguers getting involved to become better known to fans of their parent clubs and envisions international sports stars signing up.	2	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	For Brandon Steiner, whose Steiner Sports sells autographed photos and memorabilia costing hundreds of dollars and more, Egraphs is something "aimed at the lower end of the market" and a product "that doesn't have legs."	1	1	2		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	"I don't understand how that's a collectible," said Steiner, whose company began in 1987. "I don't understand why somebody would want that, a facsimile autograph. It's kind of like a replica jersey that people get when they're 6 years old."	2	1	2		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Mattingly, for one, likes the high-tech approach.	1	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	"Let's say you would sign for a Steiner or a different company like that, you would sign about 200 things. You don't know where they're going or how they're going. But this is kind of cool because you kind of have a little background of who it is and how they're connected with you. You actually get a message from the person, like: 'This is Bill and Angie. We're getting married, and we've been big fans of yours,'" he said. "And then when you leave your little voice mail, it's almost like saying: 'Hey Bill and Angie, congratulations on getting married. Thanks for being a fan.' So it actually feels a bit more personal than it would be if you were to do some of the stuff in bulk.	2	2	1		4	
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	"You think about people that have baseball rooms that they put all their stuff in. Well, now you keep it on a hard drive. And with TV the way it is, you can be scrolling all your stuff over your TV and it takes up a lot less room."	1	1	1		4

536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Despite putting constant stress on their backs, rowers and cross-country skiers may not have any more chronic lower back pain than the rest of us, a new study suggests.	1	3	2			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	Elite athletes in certain sports that ask a lot of the spine - like gymnastics and wrestling - have been found that have an increased risk of lower back pain.	2	1	3			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	Rowers and cross-country skiers don't have to bend themselves backwards. But they do have to flex and extend their spines, over and over again.	1	1	1			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	"They expose their backs to monotonous movements for a number of years," said Ida Stange Foss, of the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Oslo, the lead researcher on the study.	2	1	1			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	Yet in the long run, Foss's team found, elite rowers and skiers may have no more lower back woes than people who get their sports on TV.	2	2	1			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	Of 415 former rowers and cross-country skiers surveyed, about 56 percent said they'd had any lower back pain in the past year. That compared with 53 percent of non-athletes - a difference that could have been due to chance.	1	1	2			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	"This is an important and positive message for the athletes," Foss said in an email.	3	3	1			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	However, the news was not all good. Rowers and skiers who'd trained harder in the past year - more than 550 hours - were also more likely to have had a bout of low back pain in the past year.	2	1	3			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	The pain was generally short-lived. "Most of the elite athletes reported a pain duration between one and seven days, (or) eight to 30 days during the past year," Foss said. "Very few reported pain lasting for more than one month."	2	2	2			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	Still, that means active rowers and cross-country skiers might need to take steps to protect their backs.	1	1	2			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	"It is important for the athletes to prevent lower back pain through strengthening the core muscles and increasing the core stability, to better tolerate the high training volume," Foss said.	2	1	1			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	The study, published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, included 173 rowers and 242 cross-country skiers who'd been surveyed back in 2000. Foss's team surveyed them again in 2010, asking about their training and exercise levels over the past decade, any problems with back pain.	1	1	1			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	For comparison, the researchers surveyed 116 non-athletes and 209 athletes in orienteering - a sport that involves outdoor running and no specific strain on the back.	1	1	1			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	Most people in each group - around two-thirds - said they'd had low back pain at some point in their lives. Of the athletes, 17 to 19 percent said they'd had pain in the past week, as did 20 percent of the less sporty group.	1	1	2			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	Other studies have found that when it comes to exercise and back pain, extremes matter: Both couch potatoes and heavy-training athletes may be at increased risk.	3	1	3			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	Back in the 2000 survey of these same athletes, the researchers did find that lower back pain became more common as rowers and skiers bumped up their training to get ready for competition.	1	1	3			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	And cross-country skiers had more pain when they used "classic" techniques rather than "freestyle," Foss noted.	2	1	2			
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	"These findings," she said, "indicate that it is important to vary movement patterns and techniques, especially during intense training periods."	2	1	1

539	skyfall-listen-adeles-leaked-james-bond-theme-101000039	"Let the sky fall, when it crumbles, we will stand tall, and face it all together," Adele sings in the clip, which is smoother and jazzier than the rock-infused themes that have featured in Daniel Craig's past 007 films.	2	2	1		4

540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	The Labor Department this week reported what many Americans already know: The cost of having a smartphone is eating up an increasingly large chunk of monthly budgets.	2	1	2		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	"More than half of all U.S. cell phone owners carry a device like the iPhone," says Anton Troianovski at The Wall Street Journal, and "people have spent more on phone bills over the past four years, even as they have dialed back on dining out, clothes, and entertainment — cutbacks that have been keenly felt in the restaurant, apparel, and film industries."	2	1	2		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	Here, a guide to how smartphones are gobbling up our paychecks:	2	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	How much has smartphone spending grown?	1	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	American households on average spent $1,226 on their smartphones in 2011, up from $1,110 in 2007.	1	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	While that may not sound like a huge increase, consider that total expenditures per family rose only $67 in that period.	3	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	That means Americans were cutting back big time on other expenses.	2	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	Since 2007, annual spending on food fell by $48, apparel by $141, and non-phone entertainment by $126.	1	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	And are smartphones going to get more expensive?	1	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	Yes.	1	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	Just as consumers have grown accustomed to watching videos on their phones, wireless carriers are rolling out plans to squeeze out more money from data usage.	2	1	2		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	"Streaming 30 minutes of video per day over a 4G connection and doing nothing else" can cost $120 a month on a new Verizon data plan, says Troianovski.	2	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	Carriers earned $59 billion in data revenue in 2011, and they are expected to haul in an additional $50 billion per year by 2017.	1	2	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	Will people spend less time on their smartphones?	2	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	They certainly could cut back on their data usage, but ever since the iPhone came out in 2007, "nobody ever looked back," says Nathan Snyder at Android Authority.	3	1	1	 	4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	"The forbidden fruit had been digested into the heart and soul of Americans."	3	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	This is just sad, says Hamilton Nolan at Gawker.	3	1	2		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	"We are choosing to forgo going out in order to spend more time with our phones."	3	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	Don't smartphones save families some money though?	2	2	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	Yes.	1	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	"Some of today's telephone spending means less spending elsewhere," says Ryan Chittum at The Columbia Journalism Review.	2	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	"When one device consolidates functions formerly performed by the calendar, notebook, video camera, music player, map, newspaper, and more, you need to spend less on those things."	3	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	And aren't there bigger factors affecting family budgets?	1	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	Yes.	1	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	Since 2007, costs for medical insurance, rent, and education have risen far faster than smartphones.	1	1	1		4	
540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	"Cell phones aren't eating the family budget," says Derek Thompson at The Atlantic.	3	1	1		4

541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	How a Sneaky Sundew Hurls Insects Into Its Trap	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	The twitchy tentacles of a sundew can catapult prey into the carnivorous plant's sticky traps in a fraction of a second, researchers say.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	These fast-moving snares are among the quickest seen yet in the plant kingdom, the scientists added.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	Researchers investigated a sundew plant from southern Australia, Drosera glanduligera, whose "flower" trap grows up to 1.5 inches (4 centimeters) wide.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	Sundews get their name from the sticky drops resembling the morning dew at the end of each of their tentacles.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	Carnivorous plants such as sundews go after meat to help them survive in the nutrient-poor soils they call home.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	Past research showed D. glanduligera has a way of ensnaring prey that is unique among carnivorous plants.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	In addition to its sticky tentacles, this sundew possesses longer, touch-sensitive tentacles that can snap forward, hurling insects at its flypaper-like glue traps.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	The sticky tentacles then slowly bend to move the prey to spoon-shaped leaves, from where it is slowly digested.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	"Although the fast snap tentacles were basically known for decades, they received only very little attention from the scientific community," said researcher Thomas Speck, a biophysicist at the University of Freiburg in Germany.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	[Image Gallery: Wacky Carnivorous Plants]				I	4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	To show for the first time how these tentacles work, scientists collaborated with private sundew cultivators.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	They analyzed these plants with microscopes and high-speed video cameras in the lab, testing the sundews with fruit flies.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	"D. glanduligera is not only extremely tough to cultivate by needing high-temperature fluctuations between day (above 20 degrees C) and night (close to zero degrees C) and regular feeding with flaked fish food and fruit flies, it also grows for only a few months from germination until seed production and wilting," wrote researcher Simon Poppinga, a botanist at the University of Freiburg in Germany, in an email.	2	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	"We hence had a very small time slot to accomplish all experiments needed."	2	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	In Fahrenheit that temperature range is 68 to 32 degrees.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	The secret to the quick tentacles probably involves releasing pent-up hydraulic pressure in a sudden burst, the researchers found.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	And it happens fast.	1	1	1		4	
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	The sundew takes about 75 milliseconds to catapult prey with snap tentacles, "which is by far the fastest motion reported from the sundew genus," Speck told LiveScience.	1	1	1		4

548	somali-lawmaker-shot-dead-latest-militant-attack-220334539	MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Gunmen shot dead a Somali lawmaker on Saturday, witnesses said, the first assassination of a member of the war-torn country's newly appointed parliament.	2	1	4		4	
548	somali-lawmaker-shot-dead-latest-militant-attack-220334539	The unidentified assailants fired several shots at Mustaf Haji Mohamed shortly after evening prayers in Mogadishu's Waberi district, the latest in a wave of militant attacks since the assembly elected President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud on September 10.	1	1	4		4	
548	somali-lawmaker-shot-dead-latest-militant-attack-220334539	Mohamud has said improving security is his priority, and such attacks underscore the scale of the challenge he faces in a country where regional administrations, clan militias, Islamist militants and pirates vie for power.	2	1	2		4	
548	somali-lawmaker-shot-dead-latest-militant-attack-220334539	On Friday, gunmen shot dead a radio reporter, a day after three journalists were among 15 people killed in a suicide bombing that targeted a popular restaurant.	1	1	5		4	
548	somali-lawmaker-shot-dead-latest-militant-attack-220334539	There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the shooting of Mohamed.	1	1	1		4

549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	If you're looking to take a day off from posting on Facebook, choose Wednesday, but don't rest on Sunday or you'll miss the best opportunity of the week.	2	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	That's the advice from Buddy Media's "Strategies for Effective Wall Posts: A Timeline Analysis," a report based on activity from 1,800 of the world's biggest brand pages from April 1 to May 31.	2	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	[More from Mashable: Facebook, Gates Foundation Team Up to Create Apps For Future College Students]				I	4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	As with previous Buddy Media reports on the subject, the analysis found that marketers are still posting too little on weekends and at night and when they do post, they're way too verbose.	1	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	Weekends, when brands post too little, the audience appears primed for interaction, though it varies by industry.	1	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	For "advertising and consulting," for example, weekend posts get 69% higher interaction, but only 11% of posts are published on Saturday and Sunday.	1	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	Not every industry has the same pattern, though: Thursday is the biggest day of the week for "clothing and fashion" while Monday is the biggest for "general retail."	1	1	1		4

549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	In general, though, Hump Day is the worst day to post; interactions on Wednesday are 7.4% lower than average.	1	1	2		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	Once again, the study also found that off-hours are the best time to post.	1	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	Brand posts between 8 pm and 7 am got 14% higher interaction than those published between 8 am and 7 pm.	1	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	Meanwhile, when it comes to posts, less is more.	2	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	Brands that post one or two times a day see 19% higher interaction rates than those that publish three or more posts.	1	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	"The key is not to bombard fans with too many posts, as Facebook News Feed optimization often penalizes for this," the report cautions.	2	1	2		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	And while Twitter has a 140-character limit, Buddy Media suggests a self-imposed 80-character wall for Facebook posts.	1	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	Such posts get a 23% higher interaction than longer posts.	1	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	However, 75% of posts are beyond that limit.	1	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	It's also a good idea to run photos -- photo posts get 39% higher interaction rates than average.	1	1	1		4	
549	sorry-marketers-youre-doing-facebook-wrong-report-090256114	Text-only posts aren't a bad option either, though: They get a 12% higher-than-average rate.	1	1	1		4

563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	The invitation-only tribute for the composer of numerous hit records, movies and musicals such as "A Chorus Line" was held at the New York's Juilliard School for the Arts where Hamlisch studied as a boy after three years earlier displaying at the age of 4 a gift for mimicking music.	2	2	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	Hamlisch died after a brief illness in Los Angeles on August 6 at the age of 68, causing an outpouring of grief from well-known entertainers and fans and prompting Streisand, Hamlisch's friend for the past 45 years, to organize the tribute.	2	3	3		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	Streisand performed "The Way We Were - one of Hamlisch's best known songs and one of Streisand's biggest hits - in the tribute's finale.	2	3	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	She also recalled how they first met in 1963 when Hamlisch was the rehearsal pianist for Streisand's movie "Funny Girl," who would also on occasion fetch the cast coffee.	2	2	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	"Because I didn't drink coffee, he was assigned to get me a chocolate doughnut," Streisand told the laughing audience filled with friends, family and stars including Michael Douglas, Sarah Jessica Parker and lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman.	3	3	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	"But instead of just one, he always brought me two and so our love affair began."	3	4	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	Streisand told how she forged a friendship with the New York-born composer based on a shared passion for "music, film and food," and "without explaining why or how, we understood each others anxieties," while joking about their shared Jewish heritage.	3	3	1		4

563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	Hamlisch had called Streisand "the best voice there is."	3	4	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	Earlier Liza Minnelli, who performed "If You Really Knew Me" from Hamlisch's Tony-nominated 1979 musical, "They're Playing Our Song," said she met the composer, "when I was 14 and a half, and he was 15 and three-quarters," and soon became best friends: "He was one of my few constants that I had in my life."	3	3	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	Aretha Franklin sang a rousing version of Hamlisch's power ballad "Nobody Does It Better," which he wrote as the theme song for the 1977 James Bond film "The Spy Who Loved Me."	2	2	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	She inserted the lyric, "Marvin, you are the best" to audience cheers before lowering her voice for the spiritual ballad "Deep River."	2	3	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	Other performers included Chinese pianist Lang Lang, British stage singer Maria Friedman and trumpeter Chris Botti who all performed songs from the 1975 musical "A Chorus Line," for which Hamlisch won a Tony award and a Pulitzer Prize and which at the time became the most successful show on Broadway.	2	3	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	Hamlisch worked right up until the days before his death and the tribute showed off one of his more recent songs about his love for life, "While I Still Have The Time," from the Jerry Lewis stage-adapted comedy musical, "The Nutty Professor," which opened this year.	2	2	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	Hamlisch had the rare distinction of winning Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.	1	3	1		4	
563	streisand-minnelli-franklin-sing-marvin-hamlisch-054726494	His wife, Terre Blair Hamlisch, began the tribute recalling how Hamlisch often said he believed in the power of music to connect people, and Streisand ended it 90 minutes later.	2	2	1		4

575	swingers-hotel-german-firms-expense-claims-laid-bare-190602628--finance	BERLIN (Reuters) - A German insurance giant revealed employees put a trip to a swingers' hotel in Jamaica on company expenses when it published the results of an internal audit on a public website.	1	1	2		4	
575	swingers-hotel-german-firms-expense-claims-laid-bare-190602628--finance	The reputation of Ergo, the primary insurance unit of Munich Re, the world's biggest reinsurer, suffered a blow last year when a German newspaper reported that a subsidiary had hosted a sex party in Budapest in 2007 to reward top employees.	2	1	2		4	
575	swingers-hotel-german-firms-expense-claims-laid-bare-190602628--finance	On Sunday, Ergo unveiled a website containing details of 12 similar incidents.	1	1	2		4	
575	swingers-hotel-german-firms-expense-claims-laid-bare-190602628--finance	It showed employees had also charged the company for tickets to a strip club in Estonia.	1	1	2		4

576	swiss-family-involved-nuclear-smuggling-ring-avoids-jail-181749571	ZURICH (Reuters) - Three Swiss engineers guilty of involvement in a Pakistani nuclear smuggling ring avoided a prison sentence on Tuesday after agreeing a plea bargain with the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office.	1	2	4		4	
576	swiss-family-involved-nuclear-smuggling-ring-avoids-jail-181749571	Friedrich Tinner and his two sons, Marco and Urs, pleaded guilty at the federal criminal court in Bellinzona of supplying centrifuge parts and participating in the smuggling ring of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the former head of Pakistan's nuclear programme, who in 2004 was found by Pakistan to have sold nuclear secrets to North Korea, Iran and Libya.	1	2	3		4	
576	swiss-family-involved-nuclear-smuggling-ring-avoids-jail-181749571	However, after agreeing the plea bargain, the Tinner trio were handed relatively mild suspended jail sentences of between 24 and 50 months.	2	2	2		4	
576	swiss-family-involved-nuclear-smuggling-ring-avoids-jail-181749571	In a long testimony, Friedrich Tinner told the court on Monday about how he met A. Q. Khan in 1975 and used his business in the eastern city of St. Gallen to sell centrifuge parts for enriching uranium, the online edition of Swiss tabloid Blick reported.	2	1	3		4	
576	swiss-family-involved-nuclear-smuggling-ring-avoids-jail-181749571	The court also heard that Urs Tinner set up production sites in Dubai and Malaysia for producing centrifuge parts for enriching uranium, while Marco took care of supplies and book-keeping.	1	1	2		4	
576	swiss-family-involved-nuclear-smuggling-ring-avoids-jail-181749571	Swiss authorities started investigating Marco Tinner and his brother in 2004, confiscating thousands of documents.	1	2	3		4	
576	swiss-family-involved-nuclear-smuggling-ring-avoids-jail-181749571	A year later they expanded investigations to include Friedrich Tinner.	1	1	2		4	
576	swiss-family-involved-nuclear-smuggling-ring-avoids-jail-181749571	In 2009 Urs Tinner said that he had helped the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to uncover Libya's nuclear weapons programme by tipping it off that Libya was about to receive the equipment needed to make an atom bomb.	2	3	3		4	
576	swiss-family-involved-nuclear-smuggling-ring-avoids-jail-181749571	It was widely reported in the Swiss media that further investigations into the Tinners were halted after the CIA urged the Swiss government to drop them to avoid exposing the extent of the agency's activities.	2	2	2		4

578	syria-tells-rebels-mobile-phones-game-over-132140584	The messages signed by the Syrian Arab Army also urge the rebels to surrender their weapons and warn the countdown to evict foreign fighters has begun.	1	1	2		3

579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Now the veiled 38-year-old woman lies in a hospital bed in this northern Lebanese city, with the Quran, the Muslim holy book, on her table.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	She talks slowly, with pauses, and is visibly trying to hold back the tears.	2	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Abdul-Aziz, 3, and Talin, 13 months, were her only children.	1	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"Every time I remember, I feel the pain," she says.	3	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Um Abdou is one of thousands of Syrians who have been wounded in the uprising against Assad and its aftermath.	1	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Hundreds of the wounded have been taken for treatment in neighboring countries, mostly to Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.	1	2	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	More than 74,000 Syrians have taken refuge in Lebanon, itself a small country of just 4 million people that is struggling with instability.	1	2	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Um Abdou and her family fled their village in Homs province in March amid intense shelling, to a second village and then a third.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Two days later, it seemed quiet, and they decided to return home.	2	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The family rode back on March 31 on a motorcycle, with Um Abdou's daughter asleep in her arms and her son sitting in front of his father.	2	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Then her world fell apart.	2	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Um Abdou keeps hearing the sound not of the mortar, but of the terror.	3	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"I cannot forget the noise of the hearts beating quickly as people gathered around us," she says.	3	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Her daughter died immediately from a shrapnel wound in the head.	2	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Her son bled profusely and died minutes later, even as she looked at him.	2	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	She did not want her husband to know the children were dead, so she said nothing and started to pray.	2	2	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	But her husband was severely injured too -- the shrapnel had blown out his intestines.	1	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	And Um Abdou looked down to find her own legs hanging slightly from her body.	1	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"The moment I saw myself, I knew that my legs were going to be amputated," she says.	2	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	She and her husband were rushed to makeshift hospitals in the Syrian border towns of Qusair and Jousi.	1	2	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	With the help of Syrian rebels, she was carried on a stretcher all the way across the border to Lebanon, amid 12 hours of shelling and shooting.	2	3	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Her husband died en route.	1	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Um Abdou's children are now buried in a plot of land in Syria owned by the state.	1	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Her husband was buried in the cemetery in Jousi because it was too dangerous to take him back to his hometown.	1	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"Even the dead have no right to be buried," she says.	3	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Um Abdou has undergone four operations in Lebanon, including the two amputations.	1	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Her parents and sisters are looking after her, and she displays the green, red, white and black flag of the Syrian revolution in her room.	1	2	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	She knows the pain will be unbearable the day she goes back to Syria and visits the place where her family is buried.	2	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	In the meantime, she has written a poem in the hospital.	1	3	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"I lost my children and husband, but my soul is still strong," it reads.	3	3	4		4

579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	BAGHDAD, Iraq — The gang of masked gunmen broke into the small apartment near Damascus where Waleed Mohammed Abdul-Wahid and his family had lived for nearly three years.	2	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"Are you Sunni or Shiite?" they shouted, as his three children began to cry.	2	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"We are Sunnis!"	2	1	1		4

579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"Do you know any Shiites who are cooperating with the Syrian government?" the gunmen demanded.	3	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"We do not know any such people," she said.	2	1	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"We are from Baghdad."	2	1	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The gunmen left.	1	2	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The brief but terrifying invasion sealed the decision Abdul-Wahid had been mulling for weeks: to leave behind an increasingly violent life in Syria and return to Iraq.	2	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	More than 2, 200,000 people fled Iraq during the war and sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and almost half of them ended up in neighboring Syria.	1	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Now Syria is plagued with the same sectarian conflict, and many of the same people are on the run a second time.	1	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	At least 22,000 Iraqi refugees are thought to have left Syria to return to Iraq, despite the dangers they thought they had left behind.	2	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Abdul-Wahid had worked as a deliveryman back in Baghdad, bringing cylinders of cooking gas to both Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods.	1	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Militants kidnapped him outside his Sunni-dominated neighborhood of Azimiyah in 2009 and tortured him for four days.	1	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	His arms still show the burn scars.	1	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The family packed up and fled to Syria, where they built a new life in a mostly Shiite suburb.	2	2	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The children settled down in school, and the United Nations gave them food and an income.	1	3	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Abdul-Wahid, 49, found a job in construction and started taking medication for the severe depression he had suffered after the kidnapping.	2	3	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Then the uprising against Assad began, and violence returned to Abdul-Wahid's life.	2	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Mortars bombarded their neighborhood, and snipers shot at people in the streets.	2	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The last straw was the gunmen storming their home in late July, and asking his daughter if she was Sunni or Shiite.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"She did not reply, because she does not know the meaning of such a question," Abdul-Wahid says.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The bus fare from Damascus to Baghdad cost about $110 for each person.	1	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Abdul-Wahid had to ask his brother for money, he says, his eyes filling up with tears of sadness and shame.	3	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	His family is living in a room in his brother's house.	1	2	2		4

579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Now, I have to start from zero."	3	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He plans to go back to Syria when — or if — the violence ebbs.	2	2	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Wasan, his wife, says the shortages of electricity and water in Iraq are unbearable, as is the lack of good medical care, security and jobs.	3	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	But Abdul-Wahid is doubtful the violence will end any time soon, or Assad will be ousted from power.	3	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"I think that the armed struggle in Syria will continue for a long time," he says.	3	1	4		4

579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	It is anger at being crowded with about 32,000 other people onto a parched, treeless strip of land, where the day is too hot and the night is too cold.	3	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	But it is also a murderous anger among the Sunni Muslims here against the Shiites back home, whom they blame for the war.	3	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Many Sunnis oppose Assad's ruling regime, which is Alawite, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.	2	1	3		4

579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Baradan's father Ghassan, 50, also a farmer, says that with the ubiquitous dust, snakes, scorpions and swings in temperature, living at Zaatari is a "worse struggle than Assad's missiles falling on our heads back home."	4	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He too is angry, and blames Shiites under Assad for killing Sunnis.	4	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Baradan lived most of his life exchanging visits and sharing meals with Shiite neighbors.	2	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	But he grew increasingly resentful in recent years because he thought the Shiites were getting more food and money, and were supported by Iran, a Shiite Muslim nation.	3	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"Sunni Muslims have no respect in Syria and we fled here to find ourselves confined to this dirty prison," he sighs, puffing on his cigarette under a once-white tent, yellowed from the desert sun and heat.	4	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The thirst for revenge that is palpable at the Zaatari camp does not bode well for Syria's future.	4	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Baradan's tent is marked with the Arabic scribbling "Get out, Assad."	3	2	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Outside, a group of young Syrians lines up to fill buckets with drinking water.	1	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	One of them, Mohammad Sweidan, 17, wears a green T-shirt with an Arabic emblem that reads: "Proud Sunni."	3	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"Shiites and Alawites are not Muslims," he says.	3	1	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"They should be killed because they are infidels, who are killing the Sunnis, the true believers and followers of Islam."	5	2	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Under Baradan's tent, his 46-year-old wife says she worries about ending up stateless, like Palestinian refugees displaced in wars with Israel.	3	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	She cries as she cooks lunch on a small gas stove.	4	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"I never thought we would become refugees like them," says the woman, who calls herself Um Basel after her eldest son, in keeping with conservative Muslim tradition.	3	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Her husband interrupts.	1	1	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"Even the Israelis do not treat the Palestinians the way Assad is treating Sunnis in Syria."	3	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	In a corner, Basel too is crying as he gazes at video on his cellphone of his 9-month-old nephew, Rabee, left behind in Daraa with his family.	3	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"What is keeping me going is this video," he says, tearfully.	4	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"I can't wait to see Rabee again.	4	2	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	I miss him dearly."	4	2	4		4

579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	CAIRO, Egypt — Syrian refugee Mohammad B.'s passport expired a few weeks ago, making official what he has long known: He no longer has a country.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The 26-year-old had nowhere to renew his passport.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The Syrian embassy in Cairo was closed after protests.	1	1	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The embassies in Libya and Tunisia had switched loyalty to the opposition and could no longer issue passports.	1	1	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	And the embassy in Algeria simply told him to go back to Syria.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	That was not an option.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	In Syria, Mohammad had been studying to become an English teacher.	1	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He fled in May 2011 after he was shot in Daraa, the birthplace of the uprising.	1	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The bullet pierced his upper lip, broke his teeth, ripped through his cheekbone and exited near his temple.	1	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The deep, jagged wound identified him as an anti-government protester, which in Syria marked him for death.	1	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	At first all the protesters wanted was a new mayor and better amenities.	2	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Mohammad was hopeful.	3	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"I didn't want to leave my country, I wanted it to get better," says the soft spoken young man with a ponytail and a right eye that droops slightly from his wound.	3	3	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He uses only his first name because he fears for the safety of his parents, both government employees in Daraa.	3	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	On April 25, the military clamped off the main road into Daraa.	1	1	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Then, he says, security forces started firing into the crowd of about 50 people with large machine guns.	2	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	A bullet sliced Mohammad's lip.	2	2	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He waved his hands for help, and a car came to his aid.	2	2	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	A cellphone video he was shooting at the time, seen by The Associated Press, records the sound of a hail of bullets popping off the metal.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"It was very painful," Mohammad recalls.	4	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"I thought: Today is my last day....And the driver thought I was dead."	5	1	5		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	When he got home, his family fled to hide with relatives in the countryside.	1	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He stayed in bed for a week, unable to eat.	1	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Then he made the most difficult decision of his life: He had to leave Syria immediately.	2	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He had never left Syria before.	1	1	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He chose Egypt because he would not need a visa, and knew a friend there.	1	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Egypt does not share a border with Syria, and only about 1,700 Syrian refugees have registered there, according to the United Nations' refugee agency.	1	1	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	However, the agency estimates the real number is closer to 95,000.	2	1	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Mohammad's family gave him about $1,000 in cash, all they could spare.	1	2	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He put on dark sunglasses, wrapped a headdress over his face and prayed all the way to the airport.	3	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	The bus passed a gauntlet of 25 checkpoints.	2	1	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	At the airport, he was detained for questioning but slipped interrogators a $300 bribe.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He headed for his plane, sure he would be back.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Instead he is still in Cairo, with no money.	2	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He lives in a rundown apartment where eight people share three rooms.	1	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	With the help of a German-based aid group, Mohammad has had four operations for his face.	1	3	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	His doctor says he will need more.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	In February, one of Mohammad's five brothers made his way to Egypt, via Jordan.	1	1	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Bashar, 21, suffers from psychological problems after being shut in the house for a year watching the violence on TV.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	His presence both helps and hurts Mohammad.	2	2	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"I feel like I have a family, but on the other hand, it made my life more difficult," Mohammad said.	3	2	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"He doesn't work."	2	1	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Mohammad cannot legally work or study either.	2	1	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	But he is teaching Arabic and translating for journalists.	1	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He also is considering starting a Web-based service to collect videos, photos and other documentation of the rebellion from citizens back home.	2	2	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	He talks with his family in Syria most days by phone or Skype.	2	2	1		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	They never discuss politics.	1	1	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Since he left, security forces have gone to his house twice looking for him.	1	1	2		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"I am worried all the time about my family and friends," he says.	3	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"When I check on them, I just want to know they are still there."	3	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Above all, Mohammad longs to go home, study and have a good career.	3	2	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	None of that is possible while he is stranded in Egypt with an expired passport.	2	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"I just want to stop this bloodbath," he says.	3	1	4		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	"I don't know how."	3	1	3		4	
579	syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449	Mroue reported from Tripoli, Lebanon; Yacoub and Jakes from Baghdad, Iraq; Marjorie Olster from Cairo, Egypt; and Jamal Halaby from Zaatari, Jordan.				I	4

580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian warplanes bombed two buildings on Monday in the northern city of Aleppo, killing at least five people including three children from the same family, activists said.	2	1	5		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	The Britain-based activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll could very well rise with more people feared to be buried under the rubble of the two destroyed buildings.	3	1	4		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	Aleppo-based activist said Mohammed Saeed said the raid came before dawn. He added that the aim behind such strikes on residential areas is to "terrify the people and try to turn them against the Free Syrian Army rebel group.	4	1	4		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	"The regime wants people to say that had the Free Syrian Army not entered the city, the regime wouldn't have bombed us," Saeed said.	4	1	3		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	The fight for Aleppo, a city of 3 million that was once a bastion of support for President Bashar Assad, began in late July and is critical for both the regime and the opposition. If it falls to the opposition, it would be a major strategic victory in the civil war, giving fighters a stronghold in the north near the Turkish border. A rebel defeat, at the very least, would buy Assad more time.	3	3	3		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	Activists say nearly 30,000 people have already died in the uprising against Assad's rule that began 18 months ago, inspired by the other revolts around the Arab world against authoritarian rulers.	3	2	5		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	The Observatory the Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, said the airstrikes on the southern neighborhood of Maadi destroyed the targeted buildings. An amateur video showed people digging through a pile of rubble in search of survivors.	1	1	3		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	Fighting and shelling have been a daily occurrence in Aleppo, Syria's largest city and commercial capital, since late July when rebels attacked it and took over several neighborhoods. Repeated attacks by government troops to regain control of the areas have so far been unsuccessful.	2	1	3		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	The battle for Aleppo has marked the first time that the regime has used helicopters and warplanes regularly to strike from the air, bringing an even heavier toll of civilian casualties than before when military forces relied heavily on often indiscriminate artillery and tank shelling.	2	1	4		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	The Observatory said five people were killed in the latest airstrikes while the LCC said eight died. The LCC said the dead included three children from the same family. Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Observatory, said the death toll could rise with more people feared buried under the rubble.	3	1	5		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	The Observatory and the LCC reported violence elsewhere in the country including attacks by government troops backed by helicopter gunships on the southern town of Sheikh Miskeen in Daraa province.	1	1	3		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	The Observatory said rebels and troops were fighting near the military air base of Tabaqah in the northern province of Raqqa. Last week, rebels captured a major border crossing with Turkey in Raqqa.	1	2	3		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	The latest attacks came as the U.N.'s top human rights body prepared to vote on a resolution next week that would condemn abuses in Syria, call for perpetrators to be held accountable and extend the mission of a U.N. expert panel which has been collecting evidence of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity.	2	3	3		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	The draft resolution was submitted to the U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday by Arab countries including Morocco, Jordan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Kuwait. It is likely to receive a majority in the 47-nation council when it goes to a vote at the end of next week.	2	2	1		4	
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	The Geneva-based council received a report earlier this month from the Commission of Inquiry it appointed to investigate abuses in Syria. The panel reported that an increasing number of 'foreign elements,' including Islamic militants, are now operating in Syria. The panel also submitted a confidential list of Syrian officials who it said could be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity.	2	1	4		4

581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tablet computers, turtles and a new take on a furry old-timer are the hot toys retailers and manufacturers hope will spark a rebound from a dismal 2011 holiday season, according to a closely watched "Most Wanted" list released on Friday.	2	2	1			
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	The industry is not just counting on best-selling toys to generate joy at the cash register. Major retailers are pushing more attractive layaway plans to lure shoppers into stores before they go elsewhere this holiday season.	2	3	1			
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	Competition will be stiff over layaway: who's the earliest, with no fee or just a small fee.	2	1	2			
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	"This year (there) is going to be more action early, and it's the battle of the layaway programs," said Jim Silver, editor in chief of TimetoPlay.com, which released its "Most Wanted List" of toys on Friday.	3	1	1			
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	"Everybody is being super aggressive, announcing the hot items, saying 'come get it on layaway.'"	3	1	2			
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	Walmart U.S., Wal-Mart's largest unit, brought layaway back a month early this year - giving shoppers who live paycheck-to-paycheck more time to pay for holiday gifts.	1	3	1			
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	Toys R Us Inc offered layaway with no upfront fee, and soon after, Walmart cut its upfront fee to $5 from $15. The $5 fee will be returned in the form of a Walmart gift card if all payments are completed on time - as the $15 fee would have been.	1	2	1			
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	Last year, Wal-Mart Stores Inc used the layaway strategy successfully to boost sales, taking customers away from the likes of Toys R Us.	2	3	2

581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	The tablet made Time to Play's Holiday 2012 Most Wanted List, which is a hot read for toy industry executives. It was also featured on The Toy Insider, a holiday gift guide from a publisher that serves the toy and licensing industries, as well as gift lists from Walmart, Toys R Us and Sears Holdings Corp's Kmart.	1	2	1			
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	Time to Play's list includes returning old classics like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figures; a princess wedding castle playset for Hasbro Inc's My Little Pony; Lego Friends; and an update of Hasbro's furry 1990s toy, Furby.	1	1	1			
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	Newer characters like Just Play's Doc McStuffins could be a hit. The doll based on the Disney Junior show has landed on lists from Time to Play, Toys R Us and Toy Insider.	2	2	1			
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	"The consumer looks for value," Time to Play's Silver said. "Parents look for things that a child will play with over and over."	2	2	1			
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	Other items on the list include Thomas & Friends's Steam and Speed remote control by Mattel unit Fisher-Price, and Winx Club Everyday Concert Collections by Jakks Pacific Inc.	1	1	1

583	tamer-job-gains-expected-canada-september-183508574--business	TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada is likely to have added a modest 10,000 new jobs in September, backpedaling from gains in August that far surpassed market expectations and better reflecting the sluggish pace of the country's economic growth.	3	1	2		4	
583	tamer-job-gains-expected-canada-september-183508574--business	The gain of 10,000 jobs was the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 23 economists.	1	2	1		4	
583	tamer-job-gains-expected-canada-september-183508574--business	The most bullish forecast was for 28,000 new jobs and the most bearish was for a loss of 15,000 jobs.	3	2	2		4	
583	tamer-job-gains-expected-canada-september-183508574--business	In August, Canada added 34,300 jobs - more than doubling expectations and recouping all the 30,400 positions lost in July - but analysts see slower and steadier jobs growth as more in line with economic fundamentals.	2	1	2		4	
583	tamer-job-gains-expected-canada-september-183508574--business	"If we look at the last six months, even the six-month average, which is about 27,000, that looks high for an economy that's growing at less than 2 percent," said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC, who expects 10,000 new jobs.	2	2	2		4	
583	tamer-job-gains-expected-canada-september-183508574--business	"So we're due for a somewhat slower pace."	3	1	2		4	
583	tamer-job-gains-expected-canada-september-183508574--business	The poll's median forecast for the unemployment rate in September was 7.3 percent, unchanged from August and July.	1	1	1		4	
583	tamer-job-gains-expected-canada-september-183508574--business	Jobs growth was muted in May and June after a whopping 140,500 new jobs were created in March and April, which was the biggest two-month spree of job creation in more than 30 years.	1	2	1		4	
583	tamer-job-gains-expected-canada-september-183508574--business	"We expect a see-saw performance from the labor market in September as another strong gain in jobs (like that in August) is not likely given the current economic environment," IHS Global Insight Canadian economists Arlene Kish and Jillian Kohut wrote in a research note.	2	2	1		4	
583	tamer-job-gains-expected-canada-september-183508574--business	They forecast a loss of 15,000 jobs, but added: "There is the potential for a gain given that consumer confidence levels increased in September, but we haven't always seen survey responses reflected in actual data outcomes."	2	2	1		4

588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	New Theory on Why Men Love Breasts	1	2	1		4	
588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	Why do straight men devote so much headspace to those big, bulbous bags of fat drooping from women's chests? Scientists have never satisfactorily explained men's curious breast fixation, but now, a neuroscientist has struck upon an explanation that he says "just makes a lot of sense."	2	2	1		4	
588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	Larry Young, a professor of psychiatry at Emory University who studies the neurological basis of complex social behaviors, thinks human evolution has harnessed an ancient neural circuit that originally evolved to strengthen the mother-infant bond during breast-feeding, and now uses this brain circuitry to strengthen the bond between couples as well. The result? Men, like babies, love breasts.	1	2	1		4	
588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	When a woman's nipples are stimulated during breast-feeding, the neurochemical oxytocin, otherwise known as the "love drug," floods her brain, helping to focus her attention and affection on her baby. But research over the past few years has shown that in humans, this circuitry isn't reserved for exclusive use by infants.	1	2	1		4	
588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	Recent studies have found that nipple stimulation enhances sexual arousal in the great majority of women, and it activates the same brain areas as vaginal and clitoral stimulation. When a sexual partner touches, massages or nibbles a woman's breasts, Young said, this triggers the release of oxytocin in the woman's brain, just like what happens when a baby nurses. But in this context, the oxytocin focuses the woman's attention on her sexual partner, strengthening her desire to bond.	1	2	1		4	
588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	In other words, men can make themselves more desirable by stimulating a woman's breasts during foreplay and sex. Evolution has, in a sense, made men want to do this.	1	2	1		4	
588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	Attraction to breasts "is a brain organization effect that occurs in straight males when they go through puberty," Young told Life's Little Mysteries. "Evolution has selected for this brain organization in men that makes them attracted to the breasts in a sexual context, because the outcome is that it activates the female bonding circuit, making women feel more bonded with him. It's a behavior that males have evolved in order to stimulate the female's maternal bonding circuitry." [Why Do Men Have Nipples?]	1	2	1	S	4	
588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	So, why did this evolutionary change happen in humans, and not in other breast-feeding mammals? Young thinks it's because we form monogamous relationships, whereas 97 percent of mammals do not. "Secondly, it might have to do with the fact that we are upright and have face-to-face sex, which provides more opportunity for nipple stimulation during sex. In monogamous voles, for example, the nipples are hanging toward the ground and the voles mate from behind, so this didn't evolve," he said. "So, maybe the nature of our sexuality has allowed greater access to the breasts."	2	1	2		4	
588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	Young said competing theories of men's breast fixation don't stand up to scrutiny. For example, the argument that men tend to select full-breasted women because they think these women's breast fat will make them better at nourishing babies falls short when one considers that "sperm is cheap" compared with eggs, and men don't need to be choosy.	2	2	1		4	
588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	But Young's new theory will face scrutiny of its own. Commenting on the theory, Rutgers University anthropologist Fran Mascia-Lees, who has written extensively about the evolutionary role of breasts, said one concern is that not all men are attracted to them. "Always important whenever evolutionary biologists suggest a universal reason for a behavior and emotion: how about the cultural differences?" Mascia-Lees wrote in an email. In some African cultures, for example, women don't cover their breasts, and men don't seem to find them so, shall we say, titillating.	2	2	2		4	
588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	Young says that just because breasts aren't covered in these cultures "doesn't mean that massaging them and stimulating them is not part of the foreplay in these cultures. As of yet, there are not very many studies that look at [breast stimulation during foreplay] in an anthropological context," he said.	2	2	1		4	
588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	Young elaborates on his theory of breast love, and other neurological aspects of human sexuality, in a new book, "The Chemistry Between Us" (Current Hardcover, 2012), co-authored by Brian Alexander.	1	2	1		4

590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	HOUSTON (AP) — Former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay — still waiting to learn his legal fate since being convicted nearly two years ago for his role in a scheme to influence Texas elections — is praying for vindication but also preparing for the possibility of imprisonment.	2	2	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	DeLay's three-year prison sentence has been on hold as his case has made its way through the appellate process. For both DeLay and his critics, the process has been frustratingly slow, due in part to some of the appeals court justices in Austin recusing themselves as well as DeLay's successful effort to have a judge on the panel removed because of anti-Republican comments she made.	2	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	"I don't like living under this cloud. But I'm not angry about it. I even pray for the prosecution and my enemies," the former Houston-area congressman told The Associated Press in an interview. "No, they have not destroyed Tom DeLay as a person. And I'm ready to go to prison if that's where I'm supposed to end up."	1	2	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	But DeLay, and his attorney, Brian Wice, are hoping to get his convictions overturned. On Oct. 10, they will finally get a chance to make their case to the 3rd Court of Appeals, arguing the once-powerful Republican leader did nothing wrong and is the victim of a political vendetta, a claim that prosecutors deny.	2	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	DeLay, 65, was found guilty in November 2010 of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering for helping illegally funnel corporate money to Texas candidates in 2002.	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	Sitting with DeLay in his office in downtown Houston on Wednesday, Wice used a literary allusion to explain the case. He compared DeLay to Jean Valjean, the kind-hearted protagonist of Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables." He called Ronnie Earle, the now-retired Democratic Travis County District Attorney in Austin who charged the former lawmaker, a modern-day Inspector Javert, who pursued Valjean at all costs.	1	1	1		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	The Travis County District Attorney's Office says the case was never about politics but about someone who broke Texas law.	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	"Our office has always been fair and never been politically motivated in prosecuting this defendant or any other," said prosecutor Holly Taylor.	1	2	1		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	Jurors in Austin determined DeLay conspired with two associates, John Colyandro and Jim Ellis, to use his Texas-based political action committee to send a check for $190,000 in corporate money to an arm of the Washington-based Republican National Committee. The RNC then sent the same amount to seven Texas House candidates. Under state law, corporate money cannot be given directly to political campaigns.	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	Prosecutors claim the money helped the GOP take control of the Texas House, enabling them to push through a DeLay-engineered congressional redistricting plan that sent more Republicans to Congress in 2004, strengthening his political power.	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	A judge in January 2011 sentenced DeLay to three years in prison but allowed him to remain free on bond pending his appeal. In June, Ellis was sentenced to four years' probation. Colyandro awaits trial.	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	DeLay, who once held the No. 2 job in the House of Representatives, said he has been "unemployable" since his conviction and is living off Social Security and his $60,000 annual pension.	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	He has kept himself busy with speaking engagements and is involved with various projects that advance the conservative cause, including a religious-based one called "40 Days to Save America." He still lives in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land, an area he represented for 22 years.	1	2	1		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	DeLay said people usually recognize him from his 2009 appearance on ABC's hit television show "Dancing With the Stars."	1	2	1		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	"They have never given me a hard time for being a convicted felon," he said.	1	2	1		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	DeLay and his attorney continue to contend money laundering did not occur because no illegal funds were funneled through the RNC.	1	2	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	Wice also said he'll tell the appeals court no crime occurred because in 2002 money laundering in Texas only applied to funds in the form of cash and not checks. The state law was later changed to also specify checks.	1	2	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	"This was a situation where the prosecution couldn't sell the steak, so they sold the sizzle," Wice said.	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	Taylor called Wice's claim "rather absurd." She said DeLay's belief that his case was politically motivated is just a way to "try and explain away this legitimate prosecution."	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	While the various changes to the appeals court has resulted in a three-judge panel of two Republicans and one Democrat to hear DeLay's case, Wice said it won't give the ex-lawmaker an advantage.	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said there is some irony in DeLay — whose tough political tactics earned him the nickname "the Hammer" — claiming he is the victim of partisanship.	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	"If there is any irony here, it will be lost on Tom DeLay because when he looks out through his eyeballs he sees a partisan world," Jillson said. "He sees everyone motivated the way he was motivated."	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	But DeLay says he is not claiming to be a victim, adding his faith in Jesus Christ has helped him through this difficult time.	1	2	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	"I am totally at peace and I'm full of joy ... I'm not beaten down," he said.	1	2	1		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	The state appeals court probably won't be the last stop, as the losing side will likely take the case to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Ultimately, the case could wind up in the U.S. Supreme Court.	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	"It's frustrating to wait so long to get justice in a case like this," said Craig McDonald, the director of Texans for Public Justice, a liberal watchdog group whose complaints helped lead to the investigation of DeLay's PAC.	1	1	2		4	
590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	"I'd be surprised if he ever saw the inside of the big house," McDonald said.	1	1	2		4

591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com)	1	1	1	S	4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	- Countering recent rumors that Steven Spielberg may not even direct "Robopocalypse," DreamWorks issued a press release Monday saying that Spielberg would direct and produce the movie and that Tom Rothman is coming on board also as a producer.	2	1	1	S	4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	The film, a DreamWorks and Twentieth Century Fox co-production, will begin principal photography in early 2013 and will be released on April 25, 2014 worldwide.	1	1	1		4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	The Walt Disney Studio's Touchstone Pictures will distribute the film domestically with Twentieth Century Fox handling international distribution.	1	1	1		4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	Exploring the fate of the human race following a robot uprising, "Robopocalypse" is being adapted for the screen by Drew Goddard and is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel H. Wilson.	1	1	1		4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	DreamWorks acquired the rights to Wilson's unpublished manuscript in November 2009.	1	1	1		4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	Published by Doubleday on June 8, 2011, the book soon appeared on the New York Times best-sellers' list.	1	2	1		4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	"When someone like Tom is a free agent, you snatch him up fast," Spielberg said in a statement.	2	1	1		4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	"He has proven himself to be a necessity of this industry.	2	1	1		4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	At Fox he had already been an enthusiastic partner on ‘Robopocalypse,' and it is to our advantage that he would come produce this film with me."	3	2	1		4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	Rothman recently resigned after 18 years at Twentieth Century Fox, the last 12 as Chairman and CEO.	1	1	1		4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	"If you are in politics, you dream of a call from the White House, in baseball, from the Yankees, in movies, from Steven Spielberg," Rothman said in a statement.	3	1	1		4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	"'Robopocalypse' is the kind of important epic entertainment, a big movie with big ideas, that Steven does better than any filmmaker on earth ... I enjoyed the idea of being unemployed for a week, but this will be way more fun."	3	3	1		4	
591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	Meanwhile, CAA could not confirm reports that Anne Hathaway is circling the project.	1	1	1		4

593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	On Oct. 14, pieces of asteroids, the moon and Mars that have landed on Earth go up for sale in a public auction in Manhattan.	1	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	These meteorites may have originated in space, but many create tantalizing tales — or hint at future calamity — when they collide with Earth.	2	1	2		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	From the more than 125 meteorite pieces and related material going up for sale at Heritage Auctions, here are five with the strangest space-rock stories.	2	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	The only known fatality	1	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	On the evening of Oct. 15, 1972, farmhands in Trujillo, Venezuela, heard a sonic boom.	1	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	The next morning, a large rock was found alongside a dead cow with a crushed neck and clavicle.	1	1	2		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	Years later, scientists confirmed the rock, which in the meantime had served as a doorstop, was a meteorite, according to the catalog description of New York City's Heritage Auctions for a partial slice of the Valera meteorite.	1	1	1		4

593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	This is the only known meteorite responsible for a fatality, at least to date.	1	1	3		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	"It is going to happen, and it's going to be a very sad day.	3	1	3		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	It is inevitable that people will be killed by a meteorite," said Darryl Pitt, the meteorite consultant for the auction.	2	1	3		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	He added that when he speaks to children, this is the first thing they ask about.	2	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	He said he tells them to "worry about the things they have control over."	2	1	2		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	The only asteroid tracked to Earth	1	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	The potential for a devastating impact from an asteroid or comet is real, and astronomers are keeping an eye out for this type of threat.	1	1	2		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	On Oct. 6, 2008, Richard Kowalski, at the Catalina Sky Survey, spotted a new asteroid, dubbed 2008 TC3, on a collision course with Earth.	1	1	2		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	For the first time, astronomers around the world tracked the asteroid's approach for the day before it hit Earth.	1	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	The asteroid exploded upon entering Earth's atmosphere, and as predicted, it fell in the Nubian Desert of Northern Sudan, where 35 pounds (15.9 kilograms) of meteorites were eventually found.	1	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	Much of its mass is believed to have been vaporized or to have disintegrated when it hit Earth's atmosphere.	1	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	It was renamed Almahata Sitta, Arabic for "station six," a railroad stop on the line to Khartoum near where the meteorites were found, according to the auction catalog description.	1	1	1		4

593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	Almost 20 years ago, on Oct. 9, 1992, video cameras at Friday night football games in the northeastern United States caught the fiery descent of a meteorite that would end its fall by punching through the trunk of a red Chevy Malibu parked in Peekskill, N.Y.	1	1	2		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	The owner of the car, 18-year-old Michelle Knapp, sold the car within a week for 25 times the $400 she paid for it when buying it from her grandmother, according to the catalog.	1	2	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	Not only are two pieces of this meteorite for sale, collectors also have a chance to purchase the original title to the Malibu and the bulb from the rear tail light, which exploded when the car's trunk was punctured by the meteorite.	1	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	Chained to Earth	1	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	In 1492, a stone fell from the sky outside the walled city of Ensisheim, located in the Alsatian region of France, preceded by "a great thunder clap, then a long noise that was heard far around," the auction catalog quotes a 16th-century document.	1	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	The stone's descent was seen as a sign from God; the extraterrestrial origin of meteorites would not be accepted for another 300 years.	2	1	2		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	The Ensisheim meteorite was brought into the city and chained up in church to keep it Earth-bound.	1	1	1		4

593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	Then rocks rained down, pelting an area of about 1.9 by 4.3 miles (3 by 7 kilometers).	2	1	2		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	One small meteorite even struck a young boy after ricocheting off a banana tree.	1	1	2		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	Because the region was being ravaged by AIDS, Mbale residents believed the meteorite shower brought a cure from God, and they ground up the stones into a paste that was eaten or applied topically, the auction catalog recounts.	1	1	1		4	
593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	Within several months, 426 stones weighting 238 pounds (108 kilograms) had been recovered from this large meteorite shower.	1	1	1		4

595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	(Reuters) - The maker of the Nabi tablet computer for children sued Toys R Us Inc on Monday, saying the world's largest toy retailer stole trade secrets in preparing to introduce the rival Tabeo tablet this month.	2	1	2		4	
595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Diego, California, seeks to stop Toys R Us from selling Tabeo ahead of the all-important holiday season.	1	1	1		4	
595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	Nabi creator Fuhu Inc contends that Toys R Us agreed to become the exclusive seller of the Nabi last year to learn product secrets before bringing Tabeo to market.	2	1	2		4	
595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	The introduction of Tabeo heated up the market for tablets designed specifically for children, which also includes players like LeapFrog Enterprises Inc's LeapPad.	2	1	2		4	
595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	Fuhu accused Toys R Us of fraud, breach of contract, unfair competition and trade secret misappropriation.	2	1	3		4	
595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	Fuhu also said that Toys R Us copied Nabi's butterfly-shaped bumper,which is used to help protect the tablet, for Tabeo.	2	1	2		4	
595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	According to the lawsuit, Toys R Us agreed in October 2011 to become the exclusive Nabi distributor, but in the end did "virtually no promotion" and only ordered for the holiday season a little more than what Toys R Us said could be sold in one day.	2	1	2		4	
595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	The companies ended their exclusive agreement in January.	1	1	1		4	
595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	Fuhu said in the lawsuit that the reason for Toys R Us's behavior did not become clear until it introduced Tabeo this month.	2	1	2		4	
595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	"Toys R Us used Fuhu's trade secrets and confidential information to start selling Tabeo, which systematically attempts to replicate the Nabi experience, far earlier than Toys r Us could have done otherwise, if at all," the lawsuit said.	3	1	2		4	
595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	Aside from the order to stop selling Tabeo, Fuhu is asking that any Tabeos be turned over to Fuhu.	2	1	2		4	
595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	It is also seeking unspecified monetary damages.	1	1	2		4

596	trader-joes-recalls-peanut-butter-235519131	WASHINGTON (AP) — The grocery store chain Trader Joe's is recalling peanut butter that has been linked to 29 salmonella illnesses in 18 states.	1	1	3		4	
596	trader-joes-recalls-peanut-butter-235519131	The Food and Drug Administration and the federal Centers for Disease Control said Saturday that the store's Creamy Salted Valencia Peanut Butter, which is sold nationwide, is the likely source of the outbreak.	2	1	3		4	
596	trader-joes-recalls-peanut-butter-235519131	The agencies are investigating whether any other items sold at the store could be contaminated.	2	1	3		4	
596	trader-joes-recalls-peanut-butter-235519131	More than three-fourths of those who became ill were children under the age of 18.	2	1	3		4	
596	trader-joes-recalls-peanut-butter-235519131	No deaths have been reported.	2	1	2		4	
596	trader-joes-recalls-peanut-butter-235519131	The FDA issued a statement Saturday saying that the FDA, the CDC and the state of California briefed Trader Joe's on its investigation showing the link between the peanut butter and the illnesses on Sept. 20.	2	1	3		4	
596	trader-joes-recalls-peanut-butter-235519131	The company then agreed to remove the product from store shelves.	1	2	2		4	
596	trader-joes-recalls-peanut-butter-235519131	The government did not release which states had reported illnesses, but several states have issued warnings to residents not to eat the peanut butter.	2	1	2		4	
596	trader-joes-recalls-peanut-butter-235519131	According to the individual states' health departments, three cases were in Massachusetts, one was in Rhode Island and one was in North Carolina.	2	1	2		4

597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	NAIROBI (Reuters) - British explorer Tullow Oil Plc and its Canadian partner Africa Oil Corp started drilling a third well in Kenya, extending a campaign to discover more reserves after finding oil in the east African country earlier this year.	1	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	Drilling of the well, known as Paipai-1 and located in northern Kenya's Marsabit County, started on Saturday.	1	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	Its planned total depth is 4,112 metres and it could have as many as 121 million barrels of crude oil, Africa Oil said.	1	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	Tullow hopes the well will encounter oil, rather than gas.	2	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	"A discovery at Paipai would extend the producing plays of Sudan into Kenya and open a potentially significant and new petroleum province within Kenya," Keith Hill, Africa Oil's chief executive, said in a statement.	2	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	East Africa has become a hotbed of exploration after several petroleum discoveries in the area pushed the region into the international limelight.	2	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	However, Kenya has yet to determine whether it has commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons.	2	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	Paipai-1 on onshore Block 10A is a joint venture of Tullow, the well operator with 50 percent of the exploration license, Africa Oil, holding 30 percent, and London-listed Afren, with the remaining 20 percent.	1	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	Tullow is already drilling one other well in Kenya, known as Twiga-1, on Block 13T, about 30 kilometres west of where it made its oil discovery in March.	1	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	Hill said the results of this well are expected before the end of October.	2	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	The British company also was a venture partner in the offshore well, Mbawa-1, that encountered gas.	1	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	However, Mbawa's operator Apache Corp said it had hoped to find oil and there was insufficient gas to justify costly investments in liquefied natural gas facilities and pipelines.	2	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	If Tullow finds oil for a second time in Kenya, it may spur investment in infrastructure projects, such as a refinery and pipeline to its coastal ports.	1	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	Kenya's energy minister Kiraitu Murungi said he thought the country had enough petroleum to warrant both projects.	2	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	"We are becoming the new Middle East," Murungi said at a press conference in August.	2	1	1		4	
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	Tullow indicated it would be at least a year before it knows whether its March discovery can be extracted and exported.	2	1	1		4

598	turkey-pro-kurd-party-urges-talks-end-kurdish-080458368	ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The head of Turkey's main Kurdish party has called for talks between the government and Kurdish militants to prevent a further escalation of violence which she said could undermine efforts to draw up a new, more liberal constitution.	2	3	1		3	
598	turkey-pro-kurd-party-urges-talks-end-kurdish-080458368	More than 700 people have been killed since elections in June 2011, according to the International Crisis Group, the highest toll in a 15-month period since Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) chief Abdullah Ocalan was captured and jailed in 1999.	1	1	3		3	
598	turkey-pro-kurd-party-urges-talks-end-kurdish-080458368	Last week, fighters from the PKK - labeled a terrorist group by Turkey, Washington and the European Union - ambushed a military convoy, killing 10 soldiers and wounding about 60.	2	1	3		3

598	turkey-pro-kurd-party-urges-talks-end-kurdish-080458368	"If fighting intensifies further, there's a high risk it will spill over into ethnic clashes as social tensions rise."	1	1	3		3

598	turkey-pro-kurd-party-urges-talks-end-kurdish-080458368	The upsurge in violence coincides with efforts by Turkey's parliament to draft a more liberal constitution to replace a hardline charter drawn up after a 1980 military coup, and the government says it will include greater political freedoms for minorities.	1	3	1		3

598	turkey-pro-kurd-party-urges-talks-end-kurdish-080458368	"The Kurdish problem is about rights and freedom, it's a legal issue, and a solution requires a constitutional foundation," Kisanak said.	1	1	2		3	
598	turkey-pro-kurd-party-urges-talks-end-kurdish-080458368	"We need to focus on policies for peace and establish a climate of peace.	1	2	1		3

598	turkey-pro-kurd-party-urges-talks-end-kurdish-080458368	Some political analysts link the violence with the failure of secret peace talks, thought to have been held in 2010, in Oslo between intelligence officials and PKK negotiators.	2	1	2		3

600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	LONDON (AP) — For decades, Jimmy Savile was a fixture on British television — an eccentric, aggressively jocular host of children's shows and a tireless charity fundraiser.	3	3	1		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	When he died last year at 84 — by then knighted as Sir Jimmy — he drew tributes from Prince Charles and thousands of fans.	2	3	1		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	Now several women have come forward to claim "Sir Jimmy" was also a sexual predator who abused underage girls.	3	1	4		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	The allegations have set off ripples of shock — but not of surprise.	2	1	4		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	There had, colleagues said, long been rumors.	4	1	2		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	The main question being asked now is: Why did no one do anything?	2	1	2		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	"Maybe it was just the fact that Jimmy knew everybody," Esther Rantzen, a former BBC journalist and founder of the ChildLine child-protection charity, told Channel 4 news.	3	1	2		4

600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	Child protection advocates say the case fits a pattern seen in the response to the child-molesting Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky and in the English town of Rochdale, where a gang of men groomed vulnerable young girls for sex.	3	1	4		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	Authorities in both places have been criticized for failing to act on claims of abuse.	3	1	3		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	The allegations against Savile are made in a documentary, "Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile," to be shown Wednesday on Britain's ITV channel.	3	1	2		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	The program alleges that Savile abused girls in his Rolls-Royce, in a mobile home and at BBC's television headquarters.	3	1	4		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	It includes interviews with a woman who says Savile sexually assaulted her while she was a student at the Duncroft special-needs school near London, and with a former BBC staff member who says she saw the entertainer indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl.	3	1	4		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	The BBC said no one had made any allegations against Savile while he worked there.	2	1	2		4	
600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	"The BBC has conducted extensive searches of its files to establish whether there is any record of misconduct or allegations of misconduct by Sir Jimmy Savile during his time at the BBC.	3	2	3		4

602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	Twitter CEO promises interactive tweets, defends curbs	2	2	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter will soon roll out a free tool for users to handpick and publish selections of tweets, reflecting the company's commitment to remain a neutral, interactive platform rather than become a media company, CEO Dick Costolo said Friday.	2	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	The new tool will allow users, including journalists, to manually curate and display tweets to accompany breaking news events.	1	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	"We've known for a long time that for events in the real world, the shared experience is on Twitter," Costolo said at the Online News Association conference in San Francisco.	2	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	"We want to create an ability to curate those events."	3	2	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	Costolo dismissed speculation that Twitter had plans to operate like a traditional media company, following a recent move to restrict access to tweets only through its website or official app.	1	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	Previously, many users could read tweets through third-party applications with extra features.	1	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	Observers had widely predicted that Twitter, founded in 2006, is intent on treating its stream of published tweets much like a traditional media product that it has full control over, and which it can charge for advertising.	2	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	"It's not about being a destination," Costolo said.	2	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	"I'm a huge believer in syndication.	3	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	Platform companies always outflank and outlast point solutions and individual products."	2	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	The decision to tighten control over tweets came after the company realized it had invested significant resources in its service, but other companies were making money off of it without adding "accretive value," Costolo said.	2	2	2		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	"We were spending all this money" eliminate fake accounts and improve the Twitter experience, Costolo said, but users still had a "choice" of "experiences."	2	2	2		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	Fake accounts may be created by spammers or impersonators.	2	1	2		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	But the company has promised to unlock Twitter's full interactive potential once it has regained control over how users access Twitter across desktop computers and mobile devices.	2	2	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	Soon, users will see tweet boxes, known as cards, include live features that will look nothing like the 140-character messages units that they evolved in the early days of the service.	2	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	Costolo offered examples of interactive features, such as live polls for the NBA All Star game showing real-time results directly within a tweet box.	1	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	"We want to migrate to a world in which the 140 characters can serve as a caption for additional functionality," Costolo said.	2	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	"We'd like that to include things like real-time data, even an application functionality."	2	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	One of the services available on third-party clients but not from Twitter itself - the ability for a user to download the full archive of his or her tweets - will be available by the end of the year, Costolo predicted.	2	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	In the hour-long talk, Costolo also revealed the scorching pace of expansion at his company.	2	1	1		4	
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	Twitter, which relocated into new offices in central San Francisco in July, now boasts 1,300 employees, more than three times its headcount just 18 months.	1	1	1		4

603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	During an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Costolo suggested that the company is considering ways to "participate" in transactions that take place on the social network.	2	2	1		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	“It’s particularly interesting in areas where you’ve got things like perishable inventory, like tickets,” Costolo told CNBC in response to a question about ways Twitter could potentially grow its business.	3	3	2		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	“We observe that and are paying attention to that, and are thinking about the kinds of ways we could participate in that value exchange.”	3	2	1		5

603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	Even just the suggestion that Twitter might be looking into e-commerce options represents a significant about-face for Costolo from a few months ago.	2	2	2		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	At the AllThingsD media conference in January, Costolo shot down any plans to go this route by noting that, "We don't feel like we need to add another component to the business."	2	2	2		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	In the time since then, Twitter has focused on building up its suite of advertising products -- Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts -- by rolling these features out to dozens more countries and giving advertisers additional tools to better target specific users.	2	3	1		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	These efforts appear to be paying off for the company, as it's expected to generate more than $1 billion in annual ad revenue by 2014.	2	3	1		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	Of course, just because ad revenue is growing doesn't mean Twitter should ignore other potential sources of revenue.	2	2	2		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	While Costolo didn't offer much in the way of detail in the CNBC interview about how Twitter might approach Ecommerce, he has suggested in the past that there's an opportunity for Twitter to make it easier for businesses to sell tickets and other limited-time items through tweets.	3	2	2		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	Twitter could then potentially take a cut of these transactions.	2	2	1		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	Twitter briefly dabbled in the Ecommerce space back in 2010 with its Early Bird initiative.	2	2	2		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	Twitter promoted limited-time discounts from retailers from an @EarlyBird account and earned revenue from the sales.	1	2	1		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	However, this effort was shut down after just a few months.	2	2	2		5	
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	Do you think Twitter should try again to make Ecommerce work?	1	1	1		5

604	twitter-goes-bonkers-nfl-games-unbelievable-ending-081911741	The Packers lost to the Seahawks in Monday Night Football on a last-second hail-mary pass by Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson — a pass that was actually intercepted and let stand as a touchdown after the NFL’s replacement officials had what can only be described as a refereeing fiasco.	1	1	2		4	
604	twitter-goes-bonkers-nfl-games-unbelievable-ending-081911741	Initially, one ref signalled touchdown and another touchback, meaning he thought it was an interception.	1	1	1		4	
604	twitter-goes-bonkers-nfl-games-unbelievable-ending-081911741	After a review, the call (the one that was a touchdown) stood, and eventually the game ended.	1	1	1		4

607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	That's what Susan Rice felt was the challenge when first introduced to Twitter.	1	1	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	The United States Ambassador to the United Nations was a self-proclaimed "skeptic" of the power of social media.	1	1	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	"I thought it might cheapen the coin," Rice said at this year's Social Good Summit while speaking with Mashable CEO Pete Cashmore.	3	1	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	[More from Mashable: Social Good Summit Day 1: Highlights and Pics]				i		
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	But Rice said she quickly changed her tune, realizing that Twitter and other social media outlets provide the tools and machinery to make everyone more aware of global issues, to bring great visibility to important issues in places that can't be seen and engage people that are often overlooked in conversation.				i		
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	And most importantly, Rice felt that the immediacy and briefness of tweets forced her and her colleagues to "distill messages to their very essence," and forgo political doublespeak.	3	2	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	Now an avid Twitter user (as well as YouTube andFacebook), Rice says she uses her following to establish causes and bring change.	2	2	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	Recently she reached out to the women of Libya via social media, encouraging them to register to vote and have their voices heard in the election.	1	2	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	She even admits to calling out "bad guys" and dictators on Twitter for their reprehensible behavior.	2	1	2			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	Rice, appointed by President Obama, also spoke about the administration's focus on using technology to make accountability and transparency a two-way street between the public and elected officials.	1	2	2			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	Initiatives like Data.gov, she says, have given power to the people in understanding how the government works and how it can be more innovative in problem-solving.	3	2	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	She also recalled the Syrian ambassador's effort to keep citizens informed by posting messages to Facebook about the location of Syrian tanks.	2	1	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	This type of real-time updating would have been impossible without social media, said Rice.	2	1	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	"When it comes to foreign policy -- this is not the most necessarily modern and agile aspect, traditionally, of American government, but under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, the State Department has harnessed social media to be a much more effective tool of our outreach," Rice said.				i		
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	But Rice stays somewhat realistic about the ability for social media to mobilize people to a point of making government obsolete.	1	1	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	It's important to remember social media is a tool, not a solution, she said, adding social media provides limitations in space and remains inaccessible in certain areas of the world that need it most, such as Zimbabwe.	2	1	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	Further, social media can be harnessed in negative ways, Rice said.	3	1	2			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	Cashmore agreed.	1	1	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	"The tech itself is neutral, it's what you do with it that counts," he said.	3	1	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	The government will remain a central "part of the puzzle" in the fight for change, Rice said.	2	1	1			
607	u-ambassador-susan-rice-twitter-crucial-her-mission-163047636	She added that infrastructure, public education, and research and development are mainly responsibilities of the government, not of social media.	2	1	1

608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's administration took a big step on Thursday toward terminating a 16-year-old tomato trade agreement with Mexico following a request from growers in Florida, an important swing state in the presidential election.	2	2	2		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	The decision surprised Mexican officials and tomato producers, who have offered to renegotiate the pact.	2	1	1		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	They argue the 1996 agreement has benefited U.S. consumers and brought stability to the North American market.	3	3	1		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	Florida growers, who traditionally compete with Mexico for the U.S. winter and early spring tomato market, have pressed the Obama administration since June to terminate the pact.	2	2	1		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	Many U.S. agricultural and business groups weighed in favor of keeping the current pact out of fears the dispute could spark a tomato trade war that would have collateral damage on other commodities.	3	1	3		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	An end to the agreement would clear the way for U.S. growers to seek anti-dumping duties that could lead to higher prices for Mexican tomatoes sold in the United States.	2	2	2		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	"Today's preliminary decision is welcome news to domestic growers and the workers who have suffered under an outdated and failed agreement governing trade in fresh tomatoes with Mexico," Reggie Brown, executive director of the Florida Tomato Exchange, said in a statement.	3	3	2		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	Mexican growers export about $1.9 billion worth of tomatoes to the United States.	1	1	1		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	They say Florida producers have failed to keep pace with technology changes that have produced a tastier Mexican tomato and propelled sales in the United States.	2	3	2		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	Francisco de Rosenzweig, a senior Mexican Economy Ministry official, said Mexico's government was "very surprised" by the decision, particularly as it came one day before a long-awaited meeting between Mexican growers and the Commerce Department.	3	1	2		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	"It's very unfortunate that they issued a preliminary decision against us first before sitting down with the Mexican producers," de Rosenzweig told Reuters.	3	1	3		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	Martin Ley, a spokesman for Mexican producers, said they would put forth a "strong proposal" in the Friday meeting with U.S. officials, which they still hope will lay the foundation for a new pact.	3	2	1		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	Mexico's Economy Minister Bruno Ferrari told Reuters earlier this week it was "obvious" the Florida Tomato Exchange had timed its request to put political pressure on the White House ahead of the November 6 presidential election, he said.	2	2	1		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	Florida is one of several battleground states expected to determine the outcome of the Nov 6 election, where Obama is running against Republican challenger Mitt Romney.	1	1	1		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	The U.S. Commerce Department stopped short of immediately tearing up the agreement, as Florida growers requested in June.	1	1	1		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	But it took a preliminary position in favor of ending the pact and said it would make a final decision "as soon as practicable" and in no longer than 270 days.	2	1	1		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	"While we would have preferred that today's announcement would have ended the fight, the preliminary decision ratifying the domestic industry's position will help reverse the downward spiral the industry has been facing," Brown said.	3	2	2		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	The existing pact is called a "suspension agreement" because the Commerce Department suspended an anti-dumping investigation against Mexico in 1996 and negotiated a minimum price at which Mexican tomatoes can be sold in the United States.	2	2	2		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	Florida growers complain the agreement fails to protect them against Mexican tomatoes sold below the cost of production.	2	2	2		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	Ditching the agreement would allow Florida producers to file for new tariffs.	2	2	1		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	U.S. distributors of fresh produce sided with Mexico in the dispute, calling the notice of intent to terminate the agreement a "slap in the face" to the Mexicans and noting that thousands of jobs in border states rely on the tomato importing business.	3	1	3		4	
608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	The Fresh Produce Association of America accused Washington of acting hastily on political motives and said numerous U.S. industry groups had lobbied to uphold the tomato agreement.	3	1	3		4

609	u-epa-probes-possible-crimes-chevrons-calif-refinery-184432564--finance	The investigation is unrelated to state and federal probes of an August 6 explosion and fire that shut the central crude oil refining unit at the 245,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Richmond refinery, according to the Chronicle report.	1	1	2		4	
609	u-epa-probes-possible-crimes-chevrons-calif-refinery-184432564--finance	Chevron told the newspaper that it was cooperating with the investigation, which began early this year, prior to the fire.	1	2	2		4

611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The presidents of Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala all called for a vigorous global debate of anti-narcotics laws at the United Nations on Wednesday, raising new questions about the wisdom of the four-decade-old, U.S.-led "war on drugs."	1	2	3			
611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	Although none of the leaders explicitly called for narcotics to be legalized, they suggested at the U.N. General Assembly that they would welcome wholesale changes to policies that have shown scant evidence of limiting drug flows while contributing to massive violence throughout Latin America.	3	2	5			
611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	"It is our duty to determine - on an objective scientific basis - if we are doing the best we can or if there are better options to combat this scourge," Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said.	1	2	1			
611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who leaves office on December 1 after spending much of his presidency locked in a bloody battle with drug-smuggling gangs, called on the United Nations to lead a global debate over a less "prohibitionist" approach to drugs.	3	2	4			
611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	Guatemala's President Otto Perez Molina echoed Calderon's call and went even further, saying that "the basic premise of our war against drugs has proved to have serious shortcomings."	2	1	4			
611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	The speeches, which were a few hours apart, constituted some of the most public challenges to date of anti-drug policies that have been mostly unchanged since the 1970s.	1	1	2			
611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	Mexico and Colombia are two of Washington's firmest allies in Latin America and both work closely with U.S. anti-drug efforts. While the subject of legalization was discussed at an Americas-wide summit in Colombia attended by U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this year, raising the once-taboo subject at the 193-nation meeting in New York amounts to an escalation of the debate.	1	1	3			
611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	Obama has ruled out any major changes to drug laws, but some U.S. diplomats privately concede that the consensus around Latin America is clearly swinging against the status quo, and that some degree of change is imminent.	1	1	1			
611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	All three leaders were careful to say they were not proposing giving in to smuggling gangs that have made Latin America one of the world's most violent regions. Mexico has been particularly hard hit in recent years, with an estimated 60,000 people killed in drug-related violence during Calderon's six-year term as he attempted to crack down on cartels.	1	2	5			
611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	"We won't cede an inch" to the gangs, Calderon said.	1	3	1

611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	Calderon and Santos have suggested on other occasions that they might be open to legalization of narcotics if that helped reduce violence.	1	2	2			
611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	Colombia remains one of the world's biggest producers of cocaine despite a decade of U.S.-sponsored eradication efforts, while Mexico has seen unprecedented violence as a transit point for drugs into the United States, the world's biggest consumer of narcotics.	1	1	4

611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	The small, relatively prosperous South American nation of Uruguay has gone the furthest, sending a bill to Congress last month that would allow the state to grow and sell marijuana.	3	1	1

611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	"The debate on drugs must be frank, and without a doubt, global," Santos said.	1	1	1

612	u-n-chief-duped-prank-call-fake-canadian-010416476	During the five-minute discussion, the pair also said they asked him to speak with National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman to press for a Quebec City hockey team.	1	1	1		4

613	u-n-investigator-urges-morocco-end-police-torture-214438947	RABAT (Reuters) - The United Nations' special rapporteur said on Saturday torture against people suspected of national security crimes in Morocco was systematic and urged the country to quickly end ill treatment in its prisons and police detention centers.	2	2	4		4	
613	u-n-investigator-urges-morocco-end-police-torture-214438947	At the end of a rare fact-finding mission at the invitation of Moroccan authorities, Juan Mendez told reporters there was also evidence of torture being inflicted on people held in prisons and detention centers in the disputed Western Sahara, which Rabat controls.	3	1	3		4	
613	u-n-investigator-urges-morocco-end-police-torture-214438947	Treatment "amounting to torture" appears in Morocco during "large demonstrations, a perceived threat to national security or terrorism," Mendez told a news conference.	3	1	3		4	
613	u-n-investigator-urges-morocco-end-police-torture-214438947	"Torture tends to be much more cruel, harsh and systematic in national security issues."	3	1	4		4	
613	u-n-investigator-urges-morocco-end-police-torture-214438947	He said torture was not as common as it used to be during "the past decades", but noted his preliminary findings showed cases of "credible reports" of punches, application of electric shocks and cigarette burns.	3	2	3		4	
613	u-n-investigator-urges-morocco-end-police-torture-214438947	"In addition, I have good reason to believe there were credible allegations of sexual assault, threats of rape of the victim or family members and other forms of ill-treatment," he told the news conference, attended by relatives of jailed activists and plain clothed policemen.	3	1	4		4	
613	u-n-investigator-urges-morocco-end-police-torture-214438947	A spokesperson for the official National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), who attended Mendez' press conference, declined to comment on his findings.	2	1	1		4

613	u-n-investigator-urges-morocco-end-police-torture-214438947	Mendez will submit his findings and recommendations, coupled with the Moroccan government's responses, to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva in February.	2	1	1		4	
613	u-n-investigator-urges-morocco-end-police-torture-214438947	Torture is a criminal offence in Morocco but no official has publicly stood trial for crimes involving torture.	1	1	2		4	
613	u-n-investigator-urges-morocco-end-police-torture-214438947	Mendez said Rabat may need to amend the definition of torture "to bring the offence in line with international law".	3	2	3		4

614	u-n-nuclear-chief-amano-stand-another-term-120306330	VIENNA (Reuters) - United Nations nuclear agency chief Yukiya Amano, a key figure in international diplomacy over Iran's disputed nuclear activity, will seek a new four-year term next year, the Vienna-based organization said on Wednesday.	2	1	1		4	
614	u-n-nuclear-chief-amano-stand-another-term-120306330	Western diplomats say they expect Amano, who has taken a tougher approach on the Iran nuclear file than his predecessor Mohamed ElBaradei, to be reappointed without problems, in contrast to his close election victory in 2009.	1	1	2		4	
614	u-n-nuclear-chief-amano-stand-another-term-120306330	"I don't expect anyone will challenge him," one European diplomat said, adding that Amano has been "very firm" on Iran.	3	1	1		4	
614	u-n-nuclear-chief-amano-stand-another-term-120306330	The 35-nation governing board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which will decide on the issue by June next year, on Monday set a December 31 deadline for the nomination of candidates.	1	1	1		4	
614	u-n-nuclear-chief-amano-stand-another-term-120306330	So far, Amano is the only confirmed candidate.	1	1	1		4	
614	u-n-nuclear-chief-amano-stand-another-term-120306330	"The DG (Director General Amano) has announced that he is available for another term," the IAEA's press office said in an e-mail on Wednesday.	2	1	1		4	
614	u-n-nuclear-chief-amano-stand-another-term-120306330	Under Amano, the IAEA was criticized last year for a perceived slow initial response to Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster and the agency's ties with Tehran have become increasingly strained.	1	1	2		4	
614	u-n-nuclear-chief-amano-stand-another-term-120306330	However, Western diplomats are generally happy with the way Amano has stepped up pressure on Iran to make it stop stonewalling an agency investigation into suspected atom bomb research, even if that push has yet to bear fruit.	3	2	1		4	
614	u-n-nuclear-chief-amano-stand-another-term-120306330	Iran denies Western allegations that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons capability.	2	1	2		4

615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	U.S. poor HIV patients live longer with care extending past drugs	1	2	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Patients stepping into Johns Hopkins University's HIV clinic in east Baltimore don't just see a doctor or get prescriptions for their antiretroviral drugs; many also get help finding a place to live or bus fare to make it to their next appointment.	2	1	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Such care that goes beyond the examination table and into patients' often challenging lives has been key to helping poorer HIV patients - particularly blacks and women - live longer, healthier lives, according to a 15-year study published on Thursday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.	2	2	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Researchers at the university followed 6,366 patients in the mostly black, low-income part of a city marked by abandoned buildings and plagued by an illegal drug trade that drew national attention on the gritty television series "The Wire."	1	2	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	From 1995 to 2010, doctors at Hopkins joined with social workers and other experts to treat HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDs, and address other aspects of care that can often derail patients, such as being able to fill prescriptions or access health insurance programs for the needy.	1	1	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	They found that with additional assistance, at-risk patients who contract the virus in their late 20s can expect to live to about age 73 despite their race, sex or drug use, compared with some earlier data that showed higher mortality rates among such groups.	2	1	2		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	"Just like over time we have developed medications that are easier to take, have fewer toxicities and are more effective, I think we've done exactly the same things in our ability to deliver quality care to this particular population," Dr.	2	2	1	S	4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Richard Moore, the study's lead author, said in an interview.	1	1	1	S	4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Moore, a professor of infectious diseases and director of the university's clinic, said the program shows it is possible to counter the impact of economic disparities on healthcare.	2	2	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Even though HIV medications have significantly improved since the virus emerged in the United States decades ago, accessing those medications, receiving consistent care and follow-up appointments for the chronic condition are key, he said.	2	2	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	HIV still hits certain populations harder than others, and rising infection rates among gay black men, for example, remain a major worry among public health experts.	1	1	2		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	IMPROVING OUTCOMES	1	2	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Previous studies have shown that certain groups of HIV patients -- the poor, minorities, women and drug users -- tended to have worse outcomes and die earlier.	1	1	2		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Moore found that more comprehensive care that addresses problems such as homelessness and a lack of reliable transportation can help an average 28-year-old with HIV live roughly 45 more years with no significantly higher risk of various infections or other complications.	1	2	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Moore also credited the roughly $2 billion Ryan White CARE Act, the largest federal program solely aimed at paying for care for low-income HIV patients who are uninsured or have inadequate coverage.	2	2	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	The program, which President Barack Obama extended in 2009, is up for renewal next year.	1	1	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Michael Saag, head of the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Center for AIDS Research, said the new findings underscore the need to revamp the nation's healthcare system so that all people get quality care.	2	1	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	HIV patients are lucky to have access to Ryan White funds, but others do not.	3	2	2		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	"This is likely a fundamental reason why the poor and disadvantaged in the United States have health disparities that cause disproportionately worse clinical outcomes than those with means," Saag said in an editorial accompanying the study.	3	1	2		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Over the years, Moore said he and his colleagues have learned what tends to work, and what doesn't, when it comes to their patients.	2	1	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Moore, who has worked at the Hopkins clinic for 24 years, said patients are immediately connected to a case worker who sometimes starts counseling them even before their first appointment.	2	1	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	Other clinics have also started similar efforts in recent year, but this more comprehensive type of care is not yet available nationwide.	1	1	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	"Medical care, particularly for a lot of people who aren't necessarily well-insured or living in a stable situation, you have to just as much deal with all that aspect of assisting them with their lives," Moore said.	3	1	1		4	
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	"I wish that wasn't the case."	4	1	2		4

616	u-power-firm-dynegy-emerges-chapter-11-013411365--sector	The Houston-based company said it will have about $800 million in liquidity in the form of cash and will have eliminated more than $4 billion in debt through the Chapter 11 process.	2	2	2		4	
616	u-power-firm-dynegy-emerges-chapter-11-013411365--sector	In exchange for the elimination of debt and other obligations, unsecured creditors will receive equity representing a 99 percent stake in the reorganized company and $200 million in cash.	2	2	2		4	
616	u-power-firm-dynegy-emerges-chapter-11-013411365--sector	Dynegy Inc, which will have approximately 100 million shares outstanding after the reorganization, is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3 under the symbol "DYN".	2	1	1		4	
616	u-power-firm-dynegy-emerges-chapter-11-013411365--sector	Other Dynegy shareholders include a Franklin Resources Inc unit.	1	1	1		4	
616	u-power-firm-dynegy-emerges-chapter-11-013411365--sector	As part of the reorganization, on September 30, Dynegy Holdings LLC merged with and into the parent company Dynegy Inc.	1	1	1		4	
616	u-power-firm-dynegy-emerges-chapter-11-013411365--sector	Dynegy Inc filed for bankruptcy in July while Dynegy Holdings filed for protection from creditors on November 7, burdened by costly power plant leases and amid a dispute over whether its parent had acted properly two months earlier in taking about $1.25 billion of its coal-powered plant assets.	2	1	3		4

617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	LONDON (Reuters) - A study of eunuchs in Korea's royal court has found men without testicles live longer.	1	2	1		4	
617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	Researchers looking at the court of the Chosun Dynasty found eunuchs lived to 70 on average, or 14 to 19 years longer than "intact" men of similar socio-economic status.	2	2	1		4	
617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	Three of the 81 eunuchs studied lived to 100 or more, giving the group a centenarian rate some 130 times that in developed nations today.	1	1	1		4	
617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	During the dynasty, which ran from 1392 to 1910, boys in Korea sometimes underwent castration in order to serve as eunuchs and gain access to the privileged life of the palace.	1	1	1		4	
617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	Employed through history as guards or servants in harems across the Middle East and Asia, eunuchs in the Chosun court were allowed to marry and had families through adoption.	1	1	1		4	
617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	Kyung-Jin Min of Inha University and Cheol-Koo Lee of Korea University believe the longevity of the eunuchs was not simply attributable to their privileged lifestyle.	3	2	1		4	
617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	"Except for a few eunuchs, most lived outside the palace and spent time inside the palace only when they were on duty," Min told Reuters.	1	1	1		4	
617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	In contrast, the average lifespan of the kings, who spent their whole lives inside the palace, was just 47 years.	1	1	1		4	
617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	Previous studies have shown female mammals generally live longer than males, and one explanation is that testosterone weakens the immune system and can increase the chances of heart disease.	1	1	1		4	
617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	Scientists have also found that castration typically prolongs lifespan in animals but studies on people have been inconclusive.	1	1	1		4	
617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	While data on mentally ill, institutionalized men showed them living longer, the lifespan of castrato singers was not significantly different from their non-castrated counterparts.	1	1	1		4

618	ultrabooks-anorexic-acer-aspire-s7-080618997	Many PC manufacturers stretch the concept of the Ultrabook -- an Intel Core-powered laptop that's "ultra" portable -- by pushing the upper limits of Intel's weight and thickness specs. With the Aspire S7, Acer is admirably doing the opposite, unveiling new 11- and 13-inch designs that are remarkably light and thin.	2	3	1			
618	ultrabooks-anorexic-acer-aspire-s7-080618997	The Aspire S7 is one of the first Windows 8 machines from Acer, and it ships the same day of the launch, Oct. 26. The 11.6-inch S7 weighs just 2.29 pounds and is 0.48 of an inch thick and the 13.3-inch model is 2.86 pounds and is even slightly thinner -- 0.47 inch. That makes the Aspire S7 even more of a featherweight laptop than even the MacBook Air.	2	2	1			
618	ultrabooks-anorexic-acer-aspire-s7-080618997	[More from Mashable: Jack Bauer Bakes Cupcakes for Acer]				I		
618	ultrabooks-anorexic-acer-aspire-s7-080618997	It's no featherweight in the specs department, though, with both models sporting full HD screens with 1,920 x 1,080 resolution. Similar to the MacBooks, the S7 has an aluminum unibody design, although the lid comes in either aluminum or white Gorilla Glass 2.	2	2	1			
618	ultrabooks-anorexic-acer-aspire-s7-080618997	Did we mention the touch screen? Windows 8, of course, is tailored to be friendly to both touch and mouse-and-keyboard setups, and the S7 lets you do both. The special hinge on the S7 helps out, too: First, it lets the screen fold a full 180 degrees, laying flat with the keyboard. Second, it's a "dual-torque" design, meaning there's very little resistance when first unfolding it, but once you get to a typical usage angle the resistance builds up -- also helpful for touch.	1	3	1			
618	ultrabooks-anorexic-acer-aspire-s7-080618997	Both models sport a pair of USB 3.0 ports and a microHDMI jack for connecting to an external display, plus an SD card slot. The keyboard is backlit.	1	2	1			
618	ultrabooks-anorexic-acer-aspire-s7-080618997	In my brief hands-on with the Aspire S7, I was immediately struck by how light the two designs were. The glass lid looks amazing, though I'd be extra careful about putting it back in its case when not using it -- even with the Gorilla Glass exterior. The keyboard feels nice, although it has an unusual modification to the Caps Lock key (see the gallery).	4	4	2			
618	ultrabooks-anorexic-acer-aspire-s7-080618997	The 11-inch model packs an Intel Core i5 processor and a 128GB solid-state drive for storage. The 13-incher can include a Core i5 or i7 chip and either 128GB or 256GB for storage. Both models come with 4GB of RAM. Prices range from $1,200 to $1,650.	1	1	1

619	unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721	The Ministry of Defence (MOD) in London said mother and baby were in stable condition and a specialist "Paediatric Retrieval Team" would fly out from Britain to care for them during the long flight home.	2	3	1		4	
619	unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721	"It is not military policy to allow servicewomen to deploy on operations if they are pregnant.	2	2	2		4	
619	unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721	In this instance, the MOD was unaware of her pregnancy," the ministry said.	2	2	2		4	
619	unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721	The Daily Mail newspaper, which first reported on the birth, said the woman herself was unaware of the pregnancy.	3	1	2		4	
619	unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721	The Mail said the Royal Artillery gunner had conceived before her six-month stint in Afghanistan began.	2	1	1		4	
619	unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721	Her pre-deployment training included an eight mile (13 km) march and five mile run.	1	1	3		4	
619	unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721	Her job in the field involved providing covering fire for troops fighting insurgents.	1	2	3		4	
619	unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721	She was taken to the field hospital after complaining of stomach pains and was informed by doctors that she was about to give birth, the Mail said, citing military sources.	3	1	3		4	
619	unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721	"This is a unique occurrence, but my team is well-rehearsed in the unexpected and they adapted brilliantly to this situation," said Lieutenant Colonel Andrea Lewis, commanding officer of the field hospital, quoted by the Mail.	3	3	2		4	
619	unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721	"I am pleased to report the mother and baby are doing well and we are all delighted at the outcome."	2	3	1		4

620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	JEFFERSON CITY, Missouri (Reuters) - If anyone in the Republican Party harbors illusions that Todd Akin will bow out of the Missouri U.S. Senate race by a September 25 deadline, he is quite happy to disabuse them.	3	3	1			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"That's not going to happen," the Missouri congressman told Reuters after a rally Friday afternoon at the state Capitol. "The primary voters of Missouri gave me a job to do. That job is to beat (Democratic incumbent) Claire McCaskill."	1	1	1			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Akin was pilloried last month when he said in a television interview that women's bodies have natural biological defenses against pregnancy following "legitimate rape."	4	2	2			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	The Republican party turned on Akin, including its presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who said Akin should step aside. Powerhouse conservative groups American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS pulled funding from Missouri, as did the National Republican Senatorial Committee.	1	1	3			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	What Republicans had seen as a likely win in a conservative state in their quest to seize control of the U.S. Senate became an uphill battle. Akin had led polls before the gaffe but a recent poll has McCaskill ahead by 6 percentage points.	2	1	4			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	President Barack Obama's Democrats now control the Senate, 53-47. Republicans would need a net gain of four seats on Election Day to take the chamber, 51-49. They would need just three, however, if Romney wins the White House because control of an evenly split Senate would be determined by the vice president, who breaks all tie votes.	1	1	1			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"If I had to put money on it, I'd bet on a small victory for McCaskill," said Marvin Overby, a politics professor at the University of Missouri at Columbia.	2	3	1			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	With six weeks until the November 6 election there is still time for something dramatic to happen in this race, Overby said.	1	1	2			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Akin could still leave the race if he files a court petition to do so by this Tuesday. But few believe he will.	1	1	2			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Akin has several things going for him. He has grassroots conservative support, the former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich is campaigning for him, and Tea Party king-maker and South Carolina U.S. Senator Jim DeMint says he may offer funds to Akin.	1	3	1			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	But he faces a well-funded opponent in McCaskill, who describes Akin as "on the far right" and herself as a bipartisan centrist in a bid for the moderate voters they both need.	1	1	3			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"I believe his views are extreme and out of the mainstream for Missourians," McCaskill said on Friday in a debate with Akin in Columbia.	1	1	3			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"RAPE IS RAPE"				I		
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Congressman Akin's rape comments have become the butt of a number of jokes, including an "illegitimate rape" whistle - "sounding off on legitimate stupidity" - sold by a group in St. Louis with proceeds going to charity.	2	2	4			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Those passions prompted by the comments were on display at the Friday rally organized by Missouri Women Standing With Todd Akin, which was attended by around 100 supporters.	1	1	1			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	A few dozen protesters gathered across the road from the state Capitol and chanted "rape is rape."	1	1	4			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"I am shocked there are women who would stand against their own interests by supporting Todd Akin," said Courtney Cole, sporting a "rape is rape" badge and holding a sign saying "women's rights are human rights."	3	1	4			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"I hope this wakes women up," she said.	1	2	1			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Supporters such as Mary Howerton, who said she has known Akin for 20 years and admires the fact that, like her, he had home schooled his children.	1	3	1			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"I honestly don't know why people found Todd Akin's (rape) comments so offensive," Howerton said. "I asked my husband and he said he didn't find them offensive either."	2	2	3			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Almost all of the speakers at the rally focused on abortion. Stacey Shore, "a mom, a wife and a proud Christian," said "they can call it (abortion) a choice, but the truth is, it's murder."	1	1	4			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"We are not a moderate state," Shore said. "We are a conservative state and we stand by our Christian values."	1	2	1			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Akin himself seemed relaxed, taking the microphone from the lectern and strolling in front of a statue of Thomas Jefferson.	1	1	1			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Afterward, he said he expects Republicans donors "to take a look at this race" if it remains competitive. "Republicans are going to have to ask, 'Are we just going to ignore the fact that this is a race we can win?'" Akin said.	1	2	2			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"THAT SOUNDS LIKE ME"				I		
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Political scientists note that Akin won the August 7 Missouri primary despite being outspent three to one, so he is no stranger to uphill battles.	3	3	2			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	According to the most recent regulatory filings, as of mid-July McCaskill has raised $10.3 million to Akin's $2.3 million - which he spent in the primary.	1	1	1			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"He has to stay on message. He cannot afford off-the-cuff remarks if he wants to appeal to moderate suburban voters," Overby said.	3	2	2			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Grassroots supporters say Akin needs to stay focused on jobs and the economy to win. His speech on Friday ended on the economy but otherwise was focused mostly on abortion.	1	2	2			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	McCaskill touts bipartisan compromise to win over moderates. In one television ad called "Fifty," she boasts of a National Journal 2012 ranking of senators from liberal to conservative that places her right in the middle.	2	1	2			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"I work across the aisle and I don't think compromise is a dirty word," McCaskill says in the commercial.	3	2	2			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	Kay Henderson, a sales representative in the St. Louis area, describes herself as a moderate voter who "almost never" votes for Democrats and says she likes the McCaskill commercial.	2	2	2			
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	"I see myself as a moderate and that ad really speaks to me," she said. "I don't know if it will make me vote for McCaskill, but I'm tired of extremes and want the folks in Washington to work together and get things done."

623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	Three days after Ambassador Chris Stevens was assassinated, Jay Carney told the White House press corps it had been the work of a flash mob inflamed by an insulting video about the Prophet Muhammad.	1	1	3		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	As the killers had arrived with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons, this story seemed noncredible on its face.	4	1	4		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	Yet two days later, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice doubled down.	1	1	2		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	Appearing on five Sunday talk shows, she called the massacre the result of a "spontaneous" riot that was neither "preplanned" nor "premeditated."	2	1	2		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	Carney and Rice deceived us.	3	1	2		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	But were they deceived?	4	1	2		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	It is impossible to believe that Carney would characterize the Benghazi, Libya, massacre as the result of a protest that careened out of control unless he had been told to do so by the national security adviser, the White House chief of staff or President Barack Obama himself.	5	1	3		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	Who told Carney to say what he did?	1	1	1		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	Who arranged for Rice to appear on five shows to push this line?	2	1	2		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	Throwing a rope to Rice and Carney, the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said last week that only recently had his team concluded that Benghazi was the work of terrorists.	4	2	2		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	Yet intelligence insiders were leaking to the press the day after Stevens was murdered that it was terrorism.	3	1	3		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	Now that the cover story — that the murder of Stevens and the other Americans was the result of a spontaneous outburst the Obama administration could not have foreseen or prevented — has collapsed, the truth is tumbling out.	3	2	2		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	And the truth is more alarming.	4	1	2		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	For it calls into question the credibility and competence of Obama's security team and the judgment of the president himself.	4	1	2		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	What do we now know?	2	1	1		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	Stevens believed he was on an al-Qaida hit list and so wrote in his diary.	1	1	2		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	He was concerned about a rise in Islamic extremism in the city.	1	1	3		3	
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	"Days before the ambassador arrived from the embassy in Tripoli," The Washington Post reported Sunday, "Westerners had fled the city, and the British had closed their consulate."	1	1	3		3

624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	Three unusual earthquakes that shook a suburb west of Dallas over the weekend appear to be connected to the past disposal of wastewater from local hydraulic fracturing operations, a geophysicist who has studied earthquakes in the region says.	1	1	2		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	Preliminary data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) show the first quake, a magnitude 3.4, hit at 11:05 p.m. CDT on Saturday a few miles southeast of the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport.	1	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	It was followed 4 minutes later by a 3.1-magnitude aftershock that originated nearby.	1	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	A third, magnitude-2.1 quake trailed Saturday's rumbles by just under 24 hours, touching off at 10:41 p.m. CDT on Sunday from an epicenter a couple miles east of the first, according to the USGS.	1	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	The tremors set off a volley of 911 calls, according to Reuters, but no injuries have been reported.	2	2	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	Not a coincidence				i	3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	Before a series of small quakes on Halloween 2008, the Dallas area had never recorded a magnitude-3 earthquake, said Cliff Frohlich, associate director and senior research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin's Institute for Geophysics.	1	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	USGS data show that, since then, it has felt at least one quake at or above a magnitude 3 every year except 2010.	1	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	Frohlich said he doesn't think it's a coincidence that an intensification in seismic activity in the Dallas area came the year after a pocket of ground just south of (and thousands of feet below) the DFW airport began to be inundated with wastewater from hydraulic fracturing.				i	3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	During hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," millions of gallons of high-pressure, chemical-laden water are pumped into an underground geologic formation (the Barnett Shale, in the case of northern Texas) to free up oil.	1	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	But once fractures have been opened up in the rock and the water pressure is allowed to abate, internal pressure from the rock causes fracking fluids to rise back to the surface, becoming what the natural gas industry calls "flowback," according to the Environmental Protection Agency.				i	3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	"That's dirty water you have to get rid of," said Frohlich.	3	1	2		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	"One way people do that is to pump it back into the ground."	1	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	In a study he recently published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Frohlich analyzed 67 earthquakes recorded between November 2009 and September 2011 in a 43.5-mile (70 kilometers) grid covering northern Texas' Barnett Shale formation.				i	3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	He found that all 24 of the earthquakes with the most reliably located epicenters originated within 2 miles (3.2 km) of one or more injection wells for wastewater disposal.	1	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	The injection well just south of DFW airport has been out of use since September 2011, according to Frohlich, but he says that doesn't rule it out as a cause of the weekend's quakes.	3	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	He explained that, though water is no longer being added, lingering pressure differences from wastewater injection could still be contributing to the lubrication of long-stuck faults.	3	1	2		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	"Faults are everywhere.	3	1	2		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	A lot of them are stuck, but if you pump water in there, it reduces friction and the fault slips a little," Frohlich told Life's Little Mysteries.	2	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	"I can't prove that that's what happened, but it's a plausible explanation."	3	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	History of human-induced earthquakes				i	3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	Oliver Boyd, a USGS seismologist and an adjunct professor of geophysics at the University of Memphis, agrees that, in general, links between wastewater injection and seismic activity are plausible.	2	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	"Most, if not all, geophysicists expect induced earthquakes to be more likely from wastewater injection rather than hydrofracking," Boyd wrote in an email to Life's Little Mysteries.	3	1	2		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	"This is because the wastewater injection tends to occur at greater depth where earthquakes are more likely to nucleate.	3	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	I also agree [with Frohlich] that induced earthquakes are likely to persist for some time (months to years) after wastewater injection has ceased."	3	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	For past examples of likely human-induced earthquakes, Boyd points to the story of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, a now-closed U.S. Army chemical weapons manufacturing center that operated just outside of Denver until the early '90s.	2	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	In 1961, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal drilled a 12,000-foot-deep (3,658 meters) waste fluid disposal well near Denver.	1	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	According to the USGS, "an unusual series of earthquakes erupted in the area soon after."	3	1	2		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	Use of the well was discontinued in February 1966.	1	1	1		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	A year and a half later, on Aug. 9, 1967, a 5.3-magnitude earthquake, the most powerful in Denver's history, struck.	1	1	3		3	
624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	It was followed by a 5.2-magnitude quake in the region that November, according to the USGS.	1	1	1		3

626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Shrinking space budgets don't stop the U.S. military from dreaming about space planes or rockets capable of flying back and landing on their own.	3	2	2		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Reusable launch vehicles capable of soaring into space and returning by flying through Earth's atmosphere like airplanes could potentially save millions on expensive launches that typically cost thousands of dollars per pound — especially if they fly frequently.	2	2	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	But U.S. military officers and researchers acknowledged the challenge of pushing for next-generation space vehicles during a time of budget cuts.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	"Money is tight, and we have to make tough decisions on where to invest money," said Col. Scott Patton from Air Force Space Command.	2	1	2		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	"In the long term, we need full spectrum launch capability at dramatically lower cost."	2	1	2		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	The U.S. government spent tens of millions of dollars on space plane programs in past decades — not to mention the $3 billion National Aero-Space Plane project — but most never got off the ground before cancellation.	2	1	2		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Such half steps need to change if the U.S. hopes to create a launch vehicle that can truly revolutionize launch costs, Air Force researchers said.	2	2	1		4

626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	"The reality is that if you're going to learn, you have to go out there and fly hardware," said Jess Sponable, a program manager at the Air Force Research Laboratory.	2	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Sponable and Patton represented two of the expert panel discussing reusable launch vehicles at the AIAA Space 2012 conference hosted by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in Pasadena, Calif., on Sept. 13.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Making the dream real	1	2	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	The dream of space planes has often raced ahead of reality — original arguments for NASA's space shuttles envisioned flights once per week at a cost of just $20 million.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	But the space shuttle program ended up flying just several times per year at a cost of about $1.6 billion per flight.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	The Air Force's robotic space plane X-37B, a miniature version of the space shuttle, has flown two missions aimed at testing satellite technologies, rather than paving the way for cheap, reusable launch vehicles.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Like the retired space shuttle, X-37B launches aboard a rocket and flies back down to Earth after reentering the planet's atmosphere.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	[Photos: Air Force's Secret X-37B Missions]				I	4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	"We've got to learn how to build and fly this class of system," Sponable said.	3	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	"It's some strange, in-between hybrid that's not an aircraft and not a rocket."	2	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	The private space industry has also experimented with the space plane concept.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	SpaceShipOne, a private suborbital space plane, won the $10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004.	1	2	1	 	4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	But the air-launched vehicle and its SpaceShipTwo successor are more suited to carrying space tourists to the edge of space rather than lift heavy cargo.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Bringing rockets back	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Perhaps the most promising reusable launch vehicle designs won't be space planes at all, but simply reusable rockets.	3	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	SpaceX, the firm founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk, has begun working on a reusable rocket concept called the Grasshopper that puts landing gear on a Falcon 9 rocket's core stage.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	"We emphasize we don't care if [a solution] has wings or no wings — we want maintenance to be minimal," Sponable said.	3	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	"How you fly it and how it actually looks like is a secondary issue."	2	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	The Air Force Research Laboratory has also studied a reusable rocket concept under its Reusable Booster System (RBS) Pathfinderprogram.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	The "rocket-back" concept would involve the rocket firing its engines to reverse its climb and glide back down to an aircraft-style landing.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Rocket-back designs from Andews Space, Boeing and Lockheed Martin came out of the Phase I contracts that wrapped up this month.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	The next step would have involved a $55-75 million contract to build it, not including launch costs — but the Air Force decided to discontinue funding and shelve the project.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	"The program office was satisfied that at least one feasible system solution would have been proposed," said Jeffrey Zweber, program manager for RBS Pathfinder.	2	2	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Driving down the launch cost	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Program cancellations make the immediate future of space planes or reusable rockets seem uncertain.	2	1	2		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	But the overall market and demand for space launch services continues to grow and could support new, cheaper ways to get into space, said David Byers, an independent consultant to the U.S. government on space propulsion and power.	2	2	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	The private space industry may end up paving the way during a time of less government spending — especially with companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX working to drive down launch concepts through its conventional Falcon rockets and its more experimental Grasshopper concept.	1	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Future space plane projects would do well to learn from the SpaceX example, Air Force researchers said.	2	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	"We need to reconcile why Elon was able to do what he did with the money spent, on an order of magnitude lower cost than what models would have predicted," Sponable said.	3	1	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Zweber, Sponable's Air Force Research Laboratory colleague, also gave the cautious thumbs up for the SpaceX approach.	2	2	1		4	
626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	"I think we all wish them the best and hope they deliver on what they promise," Zweber said.	3	1	1		4

628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A love of Ernest Hemingway's writing and the thrill of tracking down his many works led a Mississippi physician to amass a huge literary collection and donate it to the University of South Carolina so students and scholars could share it, the doctor said Tuesday.	2	3	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	"It's like an Easter egg hunt.	3	3	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	You just don't know what's going to pop up," Edgar Grissom said as he described his 50-year effort to compile all of Hemingway's English-language publications.	3	3	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	"I have the most complete collection of his primary works in existence," said Grissom.	4	3	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	"There's no equal to it."	4	3	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	The 70-year-old Grissom was joined by his wife Julie, 46, at a special showing of the collection in the Ernest F. Hollings Special Collection Library on USC's Columbia campus.	2	2	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	Dozens of books in their original dust jackets, along with pamphlets, magazines, proofs and papers are on display in glass-covered cases.	2	2	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	Teachers will be able to access the collection to help students better understand Hemingway's creative writing process, university officials said.	3	2	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	"It provides a tremendous resource.	3	4	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	It makes writing real in a very powerful way," said William Rivers, chairman of the university's English Department.	3	3	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	"There is no other place in the world now where scholars can go to look at Hemingway's primary materials."	3	4	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	Grissom said his efforts began in his 20s as a medical student, and grew over the years.	2	2	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	From the time he first read "The Green Hills of Africa," until he published his own bibliography of Hemingway's work in 2011, Grissom said he intended his collection to be used by scholars.	2	2	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	Grissom said the collection includes more than 1,200 copies of novels and first editions as well as 2,500 additional items such as editor's proofs that few collectors even know exist.	2	2	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	Grissom said he and his wife were donating the collection to South Carolina because he was given encouragement and advice by several USC scholars over the years.	2	3	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	He said he encountered resistance from many research libraries and museums.	2	2	2		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	"I could give you story after story of Hemingway scholars who told me to get lost," Grissom said.	3	2	2		4

628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	In particular, Grissom said he was advised by the late USC English professor Matthew Bruccoli, an F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar, as well as Patrick Scott, the former director of USC's Rare Books and Special Collections, and Elizabeth Suddeth, who took over Scott's post last year.	2	2	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	"I had a special relationship with the University of South Carolina that I didn't have with anyone else," Grissom said.	3	3	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	University officials said the collection is so broad that it makes the school a top research center for the study of Hemingway because it includes some of the rarest of his published works.	3	4	1		4	
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	The collection includes many special items, such as a first edition of "The Sun Also Rises," the first and second editions of "Three Stories and Ten Poems," and three early printings of "The Torrents of Spring."	2	3	1		4

629	usda-sets-release-time-big-agricultural-reports-224050047--finance	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government plans to change the release time of major agricultural reports to midday, when commodity trading is in full swing, instead of current early morning releases when light trading volumes can exaggerate price moves, the Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday.	1	1	1		4	
629	usda-sets-release-time-big-agricultural-reports-224050047--finance	The new release times, which begin in January, affect the U.S. crop report and five other major agricultural reports.	1	1	1		4	
629	usda-sets-release-time-big-agricultural-reports-224050047--finance	Adoption of around-the-clock futures trading prompted the decision.	1	1	1		4	
629	usda-sets-release-time-big-agricultural-reports-224050047--finance	"The shift to a noon release allows for the greatest liquidity in the markets, provides the greatest access to the reports during working hours in the United States, and continues equal access to data among all parties," said USDA Chief Economist Joe Glauber.	2	2	1		4	
629	usda-sets-release-time-big-agricultural-reports-224050047--finance	In May, the world's two major futures exchanges shifted to nearly 24-hour trading days.	1	1	1		4	
629	usda-sets-release-time-big-agricultural-reports-224050047--finance	As a result, USDA's most significant reports were being released when markets were open but trading volume was low.	1	1	1		4	
629	usda-sets-release-time-big-agricultural-reports-224050047--finance	The new release time, noon Eastern Time, will be the first change in release time of USDA reports since 1994.	1	1	1		4

629	usda-sets-release-time-big-agricultural-reports-224050047--finance	USDA posts its reports on the Internet at the time of release as well as issuing them in print.	1	1	1		4	
629	usda-sets-release-time-big-agricultural-reports-224050047--finance	The new release time applies to the monthly crop report and its companion report on crops around the globe, the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates; the quarterly Grain Stocks report, issued in March, June, September and January; the Prospective Plantings report in March, the Acreage report in June and the Small Grains Summary in September.	1	1	1		4	
629	usda-sets-release-time-big-agricultural-reports-224050047--finance	USDA decided to continue to release three major livestock reports -- the monthly Cattle on Feed report, quarterly Hogs and Pigs report and periodic Cattle Inventory report -- in the mid afternoon.	1	1	1		4

630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	Biodegradable electronics could one day be used in temporary implants that fight surgical infections or stimulate bone growth and then get absorbed by the body, researchers say.	1	3	2		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	Such vanishing devices could also be deployed en masse during emergencies such as oil spills and then fade away when no longer needed, scientists added.	1	2	2		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	They also suggest these short-lived circuits might one day find use in disposable consumer products to help reduce the environmental impact posed by discarded electronics.	1	2	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	The idea suggests a very different philosophy from today's business as usual.	2	1	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	The microchips or integrated circuits that make up the heart of modern electronics are typically designed to last as long as possible.	1	2	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	"If you look at the history of integrated circuits, one of their key appealing attributes is how they have no moving parts, so you can make devices without the wear and tear you'd get from having moving parts that'd have virtually infinite lifetimes," said researcher John Rogers, a materials scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.				I	4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	"Our thought was that maybe it'd be interesting to have integrated circuits that offer the performance of today's integrated circuits but have the opposite lifetime characteristic," Rogers told TechNewsDaily.	3	2	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	"They'd offer stable performance, then vanish in water or bio-fluids at programmed times, engineered rates of dissolution."	2	2	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	The inspiration for transient electronics came from Rogers and his colleagues' work on biomedical implants such as electronics that help treat problems in the body or monitor life signs that include temperature, heart rate, blood sugar levels and muscle, heart or brain activity.				I	4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	One of the most daunting challenges they face is biocompatibility — making sure any implants they put in do not irritate the body, or invite rejection.	1	1	3		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	[9 Cyborg Enhancements Available Right Now] "One way to avoid the problem entirely is to just develop materials that disappear completely," Rogers said.	2	1	1	S	4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	Over the course of three years, Rogers and his colleagues have created transient versions of all the components found in normal microchips.	1	1	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	These include thin sheets of porous silicon; electrodes made of magnesium, an element normally found in the body; and encapsulation layers of magnesium oxide covered by a silk overcoat made from silkworm cocoons.	1	1	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	These encapsulation layers are the first to dissolve, and the number of them can help dictate how long these electronics last — days, weeks, months, perhaps even years.	2	1	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	To test these materials, the researchers devised a biomedical implant that used heat to fight bacterial infections in surgical wounds in mice.	1	2	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	After three weeks, the researchers saw reduced levels of infection at the wound site and only faint residues of the implant.	2	2	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	They also developed a fully transient 64-pixel digital camera.	1	1	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	Researchers envision vast opportunities for transient electronics.	1	2	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	"You can imagine biomedical devices that get implanted in the body, monitor or affect a healing process, and after that healing is completed, they simply disappear, eliminating the need to fish them out again," Rogers said.	2	2	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	"You can imagine distributing them in the environment to monitor large-scale chemical spills," he said.	2	1	2		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	"In those cases, you might want wireless sensors that transmit what's going on, but not forever — only until the spill is cleaned up, after which the devices ideally just dissolve in a benign way, eliminating the need for recovery and disposal."	2	1	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	"A third area that's a bit more challenging but equally interesting is consumer electronics," Rogers added.	3	2	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	"In some ways, it's great that normal integrated circuits last forever, but that might not necessarily be a good thing in a world where people today upgrade their smartphones every couple of years.	3	3	2		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	We're inundated with discarded electronics, and it might be appealing to make new devices that just disappear in landfills, eliminating a huge waste stream we're increasingly having to deal with."	2	3	2		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	In the future, in addition to coming up with new applications for transient electronics, "we'd like to figure out how to manufacture these things at low cost, high volume and with sophisticated functions," Rogers said.	1	3	1		4	
630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	"We want to leverage the manufacturing structures that already exist out there in the electronics industry."	1	1	1		4

632	venus-bright-star-shine-together-dawn-wednesday-114201625	Early-bird skywatchers on Wednesday (Oct. 3) will be treated to a rather extraordinary sight, when the most brilliant planet passes exceptionally close to one of the brightest stars in the sky.	1	2	1		4	
632	venus-bright-star-shine-together-dawn-wednesday-114201625	The planet is Venus and the star is Regulus in the constellation of Leo, the Lion. The celestial pair promises to dazzle observers before dawn on Wednesday, weather permitting.	1	2	1		4	
632	venus-bright-star-shine-together-dawn-wednesday-114201625	Venus is by far and away the brightest morning "star" and is currently the focal point of the eastern dawn sky. It will, in fact, remain this way all through the balance of the autumn season. Venus rises a bit more than three hours before sunrise — that’s even before the first light of dawn.	1	1	1		4	
632	venus-bright-star-shine-together-dawn-wednesday-114201625	In the days and weeks to come, early risers can take note of the fact that Venus will slowly be appearing lower, and a bit less brilliant, in the night sky. Even now, the planet appears ever so slightly lower and less dazzling than it did September, but this astonishingly bright planet is still positioned almost as well as it can be for a predawn apparition. [October's Night Sky Sights (Sky Maps)]	1	2	1		4	
632	venus-bright-star-shine-together-dawn-wednesday-114201625	At present, Venus glows just to the west (right) of the famous backwards question-mark pattern of stars known as the "Sickle of Leo" and is poised above and to the right of Leo's "lucida" – its brightest star – the bluish first magnitude star, Regulus. But because Venus is moving at just over a degree per day to the east, the space between them will rapidly close in the coming mornings. (Your closed fist held at arm's length covers about 10 degrees of the sky.)	1	1	1		4	
632	venus-bright-star-shine-together-dawn-wednesday-114201625	On Wednesday morning, as viewed from the U.S. East Coast, Venus will slide as little as 7.5 minutes of arc to the south of Regulus. To give you some idea of how small this is, it is only one-fourth the apparent width of a full moon or one-eighth of a degree.	1	1	1		4	
632	venus-bright-star-shine-together-dawn-wednesday-114201625	By the time Venus and Regulus have risen for the West Coast, the gap separating the two will have widened to 12 minutes of arc. That’s equal to the separation between Mizar and Alcor, the double star that marks the bend in the handle of the Big Dipper. Astronomy guides often state that if you can spy Alcor next to the brighter Mizar without optical aid, that you have normal vision.	1	1	1		4	
632	venus-bright-star-shine-together-dawn-wednesday-114201625	But seeing Regulus so close to Venus on Wednesday morning may be more of a challenge because of Venus' overpowering brilliance. Binoculars will no doubt prove to be a great assistance in viewing this, as Venus is now shining at magnitude -4.1, compared to bluish Regulus at magnitude +1.3 (the lower the number, the brighter the object). Converting this 5.4-magnitude difference into a ratio, we find that Regulus — one of the 21 brightest stars in the sky — shines only 1/158th as bright as Venus!	1	2	1		4

634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Space shuttle Endeavour rocketed beyond Earth orbit 25 times.	1	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Its 26th mission: A 12-mile commute through the streets of Los Angeles to its new retirement home in a museum.	1	1	3		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	With Endeavour permanently on the ground after a majestic aerial spin Friday around California, crews over the weekend will begin unbolting the shuttle from the 747 jumbo jet and putting it on a special flatbed trailer, a process that will take a few weeks.	1	3	3		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	The road trip in early October to the California Science Center has been billed as a parade, but some residents along the route have objected to the cutting down of some 400 trees to make room for the five-story-high shuttle with a 78-foot wingspan.	1	2	2		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	A crowd recently packed a public meeting where concerns were raised about the loss of shade and greenery in their neighborhoods.	1	1	2		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Museum officials have pledged to replant at least double the number of lost trees.	1	2	2		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	But Friday brought nothing but good feelings as the shuttle became California's biggest star, the people its paparazzi.	3	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	From the state Capitol to the Golden Gate Bridge to the Hollywood sign, massive crowds of spectators pointed their cellphones and cameras skyward as the shuttle, riding piggyback atop a 747 jumbo jet, buzzed past.	2	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Peggy Burke was among the hordes of camera-toting tourists who jammed the waterfront along the San Francisco Bay, reflecting on the end of an era.	3	1	3		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	"It's just a shame that the program has to end, but I'm so glad they came to the Bay area especially over the Golden Gate Bridge," she said.	3	2	2		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	"Onward to Mars."	1	3	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	At the Hollywood & Highland Center, a shopping complex with a view of the Hollywood sign, revelers yelled and screamed.	2	1	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	"It was like being in Times Square for the millennium," said Blue Fier, a college photography professor.	3	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	"This is right up there.	1	1	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	It was pretty cool."	3	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Known as the baby shuttle, Endeavour replaced Challenger, which exploded during liftoff in 1986.	1	1	5		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Endeavour rolled off the assembly line in the Mojave Desert in 1991 and a year later, rocketed to space.	1	3	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	It left Earth 25 times, logging 123 million miles.	1	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Friday's high-flying tour was a homecoming of sorts.	3	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	After a nearly five-hour loop that took Endeavour over some of the state's most treasured landmarks, it turned for its final approach, coasting down the runway on the south side of the Los Angeles International Airport, where elected officials and VIPs gathered for an arrival ceremony.	2	1	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	As the jumbo jet taxied to the hangar, an American flag popped out of the jet's hatch.	1	1	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Endeavour will stay at the airport for several weeks as crew prepare it for its 12-mile trek through city streets to the California Science Center, its new permanent home, where it will go on display Oct. 30.	1	1	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	NASA retired the shuttle fleet last year to focus on destinations beyond low-Earth orbit.	1	2	2		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Before Endeavour was grounded for good, Californians were treated to an aerial farewell.	1	2	2		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Endeavour took off from Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave desert Friday after an emotional cross-country ferry flight that made a special flyover of Tucson, Ariz., to honor its last commander, Mark Kelly, and his wife, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.	3	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	It circled the high desert that gave birth to the shuttle fleet before veering to Northern California.	1	1	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	After looping twice around the state Capitol, it swung over to the San Francisco Bay area and Silicon Valley and then headed down the coast, entering the Los Angeles air space over the Santa Monica Pier.	1	1	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	En route to LAX, it passed over a slew of tourist sites including Dodger Stadium, Disneyland and the Queen Mary.	1	1	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	The cost for shipping and handling Endeavour was estimated at $28 million, to be paid for by the science center.	1	1	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	NASA officials have said there was no extra charge to fly over Tucson because it was on the way.	1	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Endeavor's carefully choreographed victory lap was by far the most elaborate of the surviving shuttle fleet.	3	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Discovery is home at the Smithsonian Institution's hangar in Virginia after flying over the White House and National Mall.	1	1	1		4

634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Derek Reynolds, a patent attorney from a Sacramento suburb who saw the last shuttle launch last year, felt the flyover in Sacramento was a rare opportunity to share a firsthand experience of the space program with his 5-year-old son, Jack, who he pulled out of kindergarten for the day.	3	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	"I want him to experience it and give him the memory since it's the last one," Reynolds said.	3	2	2		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	As Endeavour approached LAX, other airplanes were forced to circle and wait.	1	1	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Miami snapped pictures and shot video out their windows as the shuttle arrived.	1	1	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	"This was a once-in-a-lifetime event," said pilot Doug Causey, who has been flying for 29 years.	3	2	1		4	
634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	"That was a real treat to see something like that."	3	2	1		4

636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	Vodafone says it will cost 500 million sterling to fix CWW	2	1	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone Group said it would cost about 500 million pounds ($807 million) to fix Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) over the next four years but the payback by 2016 from the acquisition would be bigger than some analysts expected.	2	1	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	The mobile operator bought CWW for a total 1.31 billion pounds in July in a deal that doubled its business with British companies and provided it with UK and international networks to increase its capacity to manage data growth.	1	1	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	It said on Thursday that it expected the business to deliver cash flow synergies of 150-200 million pounds a year by March 2016, resulting in an operating free cash flow contribution for the group in that year of 250-300 million pounds.	2	1	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	Its first priority, however, was stabilising CWW, which had long suffered from under-investment in its networks and customer service, with roughly 60 percent of the money earmarked for integration to be spent in the first 18 months.	2	1	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	CWW's Chief Executive Nick Jeffery, who ran Vodafone's global enterprise division until July, said CWW's revenues would continue the downward trend of the last three years until 2014.	1	1	2		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	"It just takes a long time for this ship to turn around, and it's that we see taking 18 months to two years," he said.	2	1	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	Longer term, however, the opportunity to provide combined telecom and IT services to companies - one of the main rationales for the deal - was better than Vodafone expected.	2	2	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	"We are seeing many customers from both companies knocking on our door for a converged fixed- mobile-hosted application offer," Chief Technology Officer Steve Pusey said.	2	1	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	The deal also gives Vodafone a 20,000-kilometre fibre network, relieving pressure on its network as data traffic from demand for services like video and reducing its bill for renting fixed line capacity from third parties like BT.	2	2	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	CWW's 425,000-kilometre international network would also be used to handle part of Vodafone's international traffic, the company said.	2	1	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	The Cable & Wireless name will live on in Britain for another couple of years, Vodafone said, while it improved the group's reputation.	2	2	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	"We need to fix some things before we're happy to put our logo above the front door," the company's UK Chief Executive Guy Lawrence said at an investor event.	2	1	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	Analysts at Espirito Santo Investment Bank said the cash flow target was ahead of their estimates, as was the synergy range of 150-200 million pounds - they had 160 million.	1	1	1		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	"The disappointment will be the length of time that it takes for Vodafone to achieve these cash flow benefits - March 2016 is more than three and a half years after the deal completed," they said.	2	1	2		4	
636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	Shares in Vodafone were 0.3 percent lower at 176.9 pence by 1332 GMT.	1	1	1		4

638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	LONDON (AP) — Global health officials have alerted doctors to be on the lookout for new cases of a virus related to SARS but said there was no sign the disease was behaving like the killer respiratory syndrome that killed hundreds in 2003.	2	1	5		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	Earlier this week, the World Health Organization announced the new coronavirus had been found in a critically ill Qatari man being treated in London as well as in a Saudi Arabian man who died several months earlier.	1	1	4		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	Genetic sequencing found the viruses in the two men to be nearly identical.	1	1	1		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	Gregory Hartl, a WHO spokesman, said Thursday the two might have been infected directly by animals and there was no indication of human to human spread.	2	1	2		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	The new coronavirus is from a family of viruses that cause the common cold as well as SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome that killed about 800 people, mostly in Asia in a 2003 epidemic.	1	1	5		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	SARS jumped to people from civet cats and then mutated into a form easily spread among humans.	1	1	2		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	Unlike SARS, the new virus also causes rapid kidney failure, a complication not usually seen in respiratory viruses.	1	1	3		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	In London, the Qatari patient is in critical but stable condition and is being treated with an artificial lung machine.	1	1	3		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	Hartl said WHO is monitoring reports of suspect cases of the new virus but none have so far been confirmed.	1	1	1		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	Britain's Health Protection Agency said a small number of potential cases were being evaluated.	1	1	1		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	On Wednesday, Danish authorities ruled out a handful of cases in people who had recently been in Saudi Arabia and Qatar hospitalized with flu-like symptoms.	2	2	1		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	WHO also issued a case definition for the new virus to help doctors spot cases early.	1	1	1		5	
638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	The agency advised them to investigate any patients hospitalized with acute respiratory syndrome not explained by other causes who had close contact with probable or confirmed cases or had recently traveled to Saudi Arabia or Qatar.	1	1	1		5

641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Doctors who treat children see scores of kids with minor illnesses every day, but serious infections are rare.	1	2	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	When such illnesses strike, children greatly benefit from having their illnesses diagnosed early, but often, the early signs are missed.	2	2	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	One way that to ensure that children with serious infections are treated quickly is for doctors to heed their "gut feelings" in assessing the children's behavior, according to a new study from Belgium.	1	2	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	The study showed that in two out of six cases where a child had a serious infection, but didn't have the clinical red-flag signs of one, the doctor had a gut feeling that something was wrong.	1	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	"Gut feelings should not be ignored, but used in decision-making," the researchers wrote in their study, published Tuesday (Sept .25) in the journal BMJ.	2	1	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Dr. Robert Chun, an assistant professor at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, said, "You have to have what I call 'a healthy amount of paranoia.'	2	1	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	You cannot miss something that could hurt them for their life."	1	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	All kids — from those with the most severe physical or mental delays, to the most advanced children — give off signs when something is wrong beyond what their lab results may show, he said.	1	1	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Where gut feelings come from	1	1	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Primary care physicians often see children with serious illnesses when their symptoms have yet to develop in measurable terms, according to the study.	1	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Chun said that doctors with experience treating children know that those who are acting lethargic or tired, despite having normal lab results, are cause for concern.	1	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	In the study, the researchers considered the cases of 3,890 children who were seen by primary care doctors for illnesses they had had for less than five days.	1	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Doctors were asked whether they had a gut feeling, beyond the child's symptoms, that the child was seriously ill.	1	1	3		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	It turned out that 21 of the children were admitted to the hospital with serious infections, such as pneumonia or meningitis.	1	1	3		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Six of these children had not been referred immediately to the hospital, because in their initial visit with the doctor, their clinical signs didn’t warrant it.	1	2	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	In two of these cases, doctors had indicated they had gut feelings that something was wrong.	1	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	But such feelings can also be wrong.	1	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	In the study, doctors had gut feelings in 44 cases where those feelings turned out to be a false alarm.	1	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Chun said that number of false alarms is not a reason to ignore the case where gut feelings were correct.	1	1	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	"No one remembers the kid that you suspected, that turned out to be fine," he said.	2	2	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	"But every one remembers the things you didn't look into — those are the ones that haunt you."	2	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	The role of parents	1	1	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	In the study, the researchers attempted to learn more about the basis for gut feelings by asking doctors exactly what prompted their uneasiness.	1	1	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	They found that gut feelings were most likely to arise when a child had a history of convulsions.	1	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Additionally, gut feelings were strongly influenced by parents' concerns about their child's illness.	1	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Chun said, "When a child is lethargic, when the parents say, 'this is unusual,' as a clinician, you need to have a enough humility to know that even those all the lab numbers are normal, you need to look closer, and be more anxious."	2	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	In fact, Chun recently treated a 5-year-old boy with a rare infection of necrotizing fasciitis (sometimes called flesh-eating bacteria), and parental intuition played a role in the case.	1	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	"Moms and dads know their kid, they know that something's not right," he said.	2	1	2		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	"There's nothing scientific about this," he said, adding that a more objective way to diagnose rare infections would certainly be desirable.	2	2	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Getting second opinions from colleagues can help.	1	2	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	But in the meantime, "when you have that feeling, you have to investigate further," he said.	2	1	1		4	
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Pass it on: Doctors' gut feelings may help diagnose children's rare infections, a new study suggests.	1	2	1		4

643	why-seats-coming-loose-american-airlines-planes-160000973	American Airlines passengers are pretty rattled... literally.	2	2	2		4	
643	why-seats-coming-loose-american-airlines-planes-160000973	Over a span of three days, rows of seats have come loose on three of the airline's Boeing 757 jets — in mid-air.	2	1	2		4	
643	why-seats-coming-loose-american-airlines-planes-160000973	The airline says it will inspect eight other 757s with similar seats to make sure they don't have problems.	1	2	2		4

643	why-seats-coming-loose-american-airlines-planes-160000973	But what exactly going on with these planes?	2	1	2		4	
643	why-seats-coming-loose-american-airlines-planes-160000973	Here, a brief guide:What happened on these planes?While the jets were in flight, a row of seats on each of the planes — one going from Vail, Colo., to Dallas, one from Boston to Miami, and another from New York to Miami — came loose and tipped over.	1	1	3		4	
643	why-seats-coming-loose-american-airlines-planes-160000973	"The seats flipped backwards," one passenger tells ABC News, "and so people were essentially on the laps of the people behind them with their legs up in the air."	3	2	3		4

649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - Tiger Woods may be the greatest golfer of his generation but at the Ryder Cup he has been Joe Average and on Tuesday accepted responsibility for the dismal U.S. showing for the past 15 years.	3	3	3			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	During a period where Woods reigned supreme over the golf world winning 74 PGA Tour titles, including 14 majors, he has been unable to extend his dominance to the biennial competition that pits the U.S. best against Europe's best.	2	3	2			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	A mediocre 13-14-2 mark from six Ryder Cups does not enhance the brilliance resume of Woods, who has been able to celebrate just one team win from six Ryder Cup appearances.	4	3	2			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	Woods's struggles have coincided with lean times for the U.S. with Europe hoisting the Cup in six of the last eight events.	2	1	2			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	"Well, certainly I am responsible for that because I didn't earn the points that I was put out there for," Woods told reporters. "I believe I was out there, what, in five sessions each time and I didn't go 5-0 on our side.	3	1	2			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	"So I certainly am a part of that and that's part of being a team. I needed to go get my points for my team and I didn't do that.	2	1	2			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	"Hopefully I can do that this week, and hopefully the other guys can do the same and we can get this thing rolling."	1	2	1			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	Medinah Country Club, which will serve as the scene for this week's 39th U.S.-Europe showdown, represents a great chance for Woods to improve his record.	1	3	1			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	Medinah has been a happy hunting ground for the 36-year-old American, who picked up two of his 14 majors at the stately tree-lined layout with victories at the 1999 and 2006 PGA Championships.	2	3	1			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	"I've always loved coming here," said Woods, who is also a five-time winner of the PGA Tour event at nearby Cog Hill. "I enjoy playing in Chicago and for some reason, I've just had a lot of success here.	3	4	1			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	"I don't know what it is but I seem to be very, very comfortable here."	2	2	1			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	There have been differing theories behind why Woods has not been able to impose his will on the Ryder Cup in the same fashion he has been able to in PGA Tour events.	1	1	2			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	Graeme McDowell, a U.S. Open winner and three-time member of the European team, believes that for much of Woods's career he has played with a target on his back. The same bull's-eye current world number one Rory McIlroy will have painted on his golf shirt this week.	2	1	1			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	"I kind of liken it to playing premiership football, the biggest teams, the Manchester Uniteds, the Liverpools, the Chelseas, the Arsenals," explained McDowell.	2	2				
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	"Any lesser team that comes to play these guys, they have a tendency to raise their game because it's a huge game for an underdog to play a Tiger Woods.	1	3	1			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	"They get up for it. They are not expected to win."	3	2	2			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	Finding the right playing partner for Woods, who is back close to his best form winning three PGA Tour events this year, has always proven a bit of puzzle for U.S. captains.	1	2	2			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	His singles record of 4-1-1 is impressive, but he does not play well with others as marks of 4-7-1 in foursomes and 5-6-0 in four ball suggest.	2	3	2			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	In golf's version of speed dating, Woods has been set up with just about everyone but has yet to find someone he truly clicks with.	2	1	2			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	At Oakland Hills in Michigan in 2004, captain Hal Sutton played the ultimate hunch matching Woods with long-time rival Phil Mickelson in a partnership that failed miserably.	2	1	3			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	More recently, Woods has seen duty with the ever steady and unflappable Jim Furyk and found some success with the quiet and humble Steve Stricker, one of the best putters on the PGA Tour.	2	3	1			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	This time it will be up to captain Davis Love III, who has partnered Woods as a player, to find the perfect match for the world number two.	1	3	1			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	"Tiger can play great and his partner not play well, or the other team play extremely well," said Love. "Somebody has to play in Tiger's bubble and I think that's the challenge.	2	2	2			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	"Steve Stricker has found his way into that pairing because he can handle everything that's going on around Tiger.	2	2	1			
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	"It's easier to play with Dustin (Johnson) probably or it's easier to play with Jim Furyk than it is to pair a guy with Tiger because you get the extra attention and the extra pressure."	2	2	2

652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	"The proof is in the pudding," said health department spokesman Chanel Caraway.	2	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	"Overall, this suggests that parents are OK with the service being available to their children."	3	2	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	Last year, when the plan was implemented, about 4.7 percent of the 12,000 girls enrolled in those schools was given the prescription drug, according to the Board of Health.	1	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	Students ranged in age from 14 to 18.	1	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	This year, the program was expanded from five to 13 schools, and Caraway said they intend to continue expanding to eventually cover all of the city's public schools.	1	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	Plan B, also known as the "morning after" pill, works in a similar way to birth control pills, except it is taken after sex to prevent an unplanned pregnancy, according to its manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals.	1	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	The pill should be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours of unprotected sex or birth control failure.	1	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	Plan B should not "affect or terminate" an existing pregnancy, according to the company's advertising.	1	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	New York City's pilot program, Connecting Adolescents To Comprehensive Health or CATCH, is aimed at stemming the teen pregnancy rate, which causes many girls to leave school.	1	1	 2		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	Teen pregnancy rates dropped 25 percent in the city between 2001 and 2010, according to the Department of Health.	1	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	The CATCH program targets selected schools in poorer districts without health centers.	1	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	Parents are sent a letter informing them of the availability of contraception.	1	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	If they do not check a box telling the school not to distribute contraceptives to their child, the student may access the drugs without permission.	1	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	"We wait about a month to give parents a chance to read the letter and opt out," said Caraway.	2	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	"After that, any student at one of these schools can get emergency contraception or a pregnancy test if they feel they may be pregnant or have had unprotected sex."	2	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	Students have long had access to condoms in the city schools.	1	1	1		4

Wallace, a New York City psychologist and founder and CEO of Janisaw Company, which specializes in life skills programs for young women, said she has "mixed feelings" about providing Plan B without explicit parental consent.	2	1	2		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	She acknowledges that providing contraception does not "encourage" more sexual activity and that most parents "try hard" to educate their teens about sexual health and values.	2	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	But other parents do a poor job talking to their teens.	2	1	2		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	"I do think we need to use caution in providing the Plan B pill to teens who may not fully understand why and how to use it," said Wallace.	3	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	She said schools should have a protocol for how the contraceptive drugs will be distributed and need to provide follow-up to make sure the teen is "physically OK and to help them make more responsible decision in the future."	2	1	1		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	"There really isn't enough comprehensive sexual health education provided in the schools in general, so it is alarming that they would offer Plan B in the absence of that," said Wallace.	3	1	2		4	
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	According to the Board of Health, 7,000 girls under age 17 got pregnant last year throughout New York City and 90 percent were unplanned.	1	1	1		4

654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook Inc and most of its adversaries in a raft of lawsuits over its $16 billion initial public offering can agree on at least one thing: that the cases should be heard in a New York court.	2	2	2		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	At a hearing on Thursday, lawyers for both sides asked a judicial panel to pool together dozens of lawsuits against the social networking company in Manhattan federal court.	1	1	2		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	The panel made no immediate ruling, but did not question the idea of grouping the cases in New York.	1	1	1		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	In at least 33 lawsuits seeking class-action status, Facebook investors have asked courts to hold the company and its underwriters responsible for causing them losses in the IPO in May.	1	1	2		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	Investors say they lost money due to technical glitches on the Nasdaq stock market and accuse the company of selectively disclosing unflattering information about its business prospects to Wall Street analysts who then shared it with privileged investors.	1	1	3		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	Facebook's IPO was one of the most hotly anticipated in recent memory, but the technical malfunctions embarrassed the company and the NASDAQ.	3	3	3		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	The lawsuits, which seek unspecified damages, could cost Facebook millions of dollars to defend, as it strives to put the IPO problems behind it.	3	1	3		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	While lawsuits have been also been filed in California, Florida and Washington, D.C., most plaintiffs and the defendants say the cases should proceed in New York because witnesses, evidence relating to the IPO, and the underwriter banks are all in that city.	1	1	2		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	"We're glad to be in New York and we'd like to stay here," Andrew Clubok, a lawyer for Facebook, told the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation at the hearing in Manhattan federal court.	2	2	1		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	The only lawyer to speak against consolidation of the cases represented plaintiffs in two "derivative" lawsuits currently before a federal judge in San Francisco.	1	1	2		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	Those suits seek to hold Facebook's board and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg responsible for damage they claim was done to the company.	1	1	2		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	The derivatives plaintiffs say the litigation should take place in California state court, near Facebook's headquarters, for easy access to witnesses and documents.	1	2	1		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	The 11-judge multidistrict panel, which meets periodically to decide where wide-ranging litigation should be consolidated, is expected to issue a decision within weeks.	1	1	1		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	Seven judges were present for Thursday's hearing.	1	1	1		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	Most of the cases are in New York already, and have been added to the docket of Manhattan federal judge Robert Sweet ever since he was randomly assigned the first complaint.	1	1	2		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	"There may be a good chance that Judge Sweet could get this case," panel Judge Paul Barbadoro of New Hampshire said, prompting laughs from the crowded courtroom.	3	2	1		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	Facebook has said that it did not violate any rules and that Nasdaq was to blame for trading glitches on its first day of trading.	2	2	2		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	NASDAQ OMX Group Inc is also facing investor lawsuits that claim it was negligent in failing to execute trades in the face of record-breaking volume during the IPO.	1	1	2		4	
654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	William Slaughter, an attorney for NASDAQ, told the judges on Thursday that the exchange agreed those cases should also be before Judge Sweet, but that they should proceed on a separate track from the Facebook lawsuits.	1	1	1		4

658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	Carbon Audio's Zooka Bluetooth Speaker Bar is a versatile stand for your iPad that also wirelessly supplements that tablet's tinny speaker.	2	3	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	It works with any Bluetooth compatible device -- including laptops -- and because of its flexible silicone construction, you can prop up lots of devices with it while it cranks out the sound.	2	2	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	We gave it a listen.	1	1	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	When I first held this Zooka speaker bar in my hands, I was impressed with the silicone material used for its construction.	2	3	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	It has a silky feel to it, and it's flexible enough to fit all three models of the iPad, all of which I successfully fit into its flexible slot.	2	3	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	[More from Mashable: Is ‘Bad Piggies’ More Fun Than ‘Angry Birds’?]				I	4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	I also tested the Zooka perched atop a MacBook Pro with Retina display, and it fit perfectly on the display without getting in the way of the screen.	3	4	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	It also works on a MacBook Air, and any other modern laptop with Bluetooth compatibility and a thin screen.	2	2	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	With all the Bluetooth devices with which I tested it, the Zooka paired up easily and sounded a lot better than any onboard speakers.	3	4	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	There's a kickstand that stows away inside, and it's easy to remove it and screw it into the back of the device, turning it into an ideal stand for iPads or other similarly dimensioned tablets, smartphones or music players.	2	2	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	I even tried it with an iPhone 5, which works particularly well in portrait mode because of the little cutout for the iPhone's Home button, and can function in landscape mode if you carefully place it within the silicone slot.	2	3	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	There's even a decent microphone that works well as a speakerphone, and it's great for FaceTime or Skype conversations.	2	4	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	And if you don't have Bluetooth, there's an auxiliary jack on the bottom that can accommodate any device which outputs audio via a 3.5 mm jack.	2	3	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	And the company says the Zooka's "extended battery life" will let you rock your tunes for eight hours before you need to recharge, which in my testing seemed like a conservative estimate.	2	3	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	How does it sound?	1	1	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	I tried the Zooka for listening to all types of music, and while its high frequencies and mid-range sound is excellent and surprisingly powerful, the small, side-firing speakers had trouble with bass.	2	4	2		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	Its sound is nowhere near as good as most of the bulky Bluetooth docks I've tested, but it's certainly a whole lot better than the iPad's and iPhone's internal speakers.	2	3	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	I especially like using the Zooka to watch Netflix video on an iPad.	2	3	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	I noticed the sound was perfectly usable, unless I was watching a movie that had lots of explosions -- making its weak bass response more noticeable.	2	3	2		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	But there's a trade-off here -- the upside is that it's so portable, you can take it along with you for acceptable sound wherever you go.	3	2	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	Formerly a Kickstarter project, this beautifully designed speaker bar is now available in the Apple Store for $99.95.	1	1	1		4	
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	Given its high-quality construction, good sound, quality materials and user-friendly design, I think it's a good value, especially if you can find it somewhere on sale.	3	4	1		4
