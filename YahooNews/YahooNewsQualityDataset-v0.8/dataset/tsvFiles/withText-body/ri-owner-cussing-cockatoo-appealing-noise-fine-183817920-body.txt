WARWICK, R.I. (AP) â€” The owner of a foul-mouthed cockatoo in Rhode Island who was slapped with a $15 fine for violating a noise ordinance is appealing.The Providence Journal reports (bit.ly/RUIVG4) that Warwick resident Lynne Taylor is appealing to a state court a fine imposed by a municipal judge. The judge said Taylor had broken a local law that prohibits residents from letting their pets habitually howl, bark or make other noise.Taylor's lawyer says the ordinance is unconstitutional because it gives no parameters for what noise constitutes a violation. He notes the statute says that if someone is annoyed, it's a public nuisance.A neighbor accused Taylor's bird of parroting vulgar phrases, cursing and loudly speaking expletives. The neighbor lives with Taylor's ex-husband.___Information from: The Providence Journal, http://www.providencejournal.com	4	4	3	4	3	3	2	3	3	1	2	1	1	2	3	4
