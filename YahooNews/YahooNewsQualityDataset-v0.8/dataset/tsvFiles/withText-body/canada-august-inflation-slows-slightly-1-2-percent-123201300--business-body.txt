OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate in August officially slipped to 1.2 percent from 1.3 percent in July, but there was in fact little difference between the two months, Statistics Canada said on Friday.Statscan analysts said the more precise August figure was 1.24 percent and had been rounded down to 1.2 percent. July's figure of 1.25 percent had been rounded up to 1.3 percent.Market analysts had expected a 1.3 percent year-on-year increase in August.The steady figure puts little pressure on the Bank of Canada to raise its key interest rate from the current near-record low of 1.0 percent.The central bank, which targets a 2 percent inflation rate, started signaling in April it might raise rates if the economy continued to grow.The only major component to drop in the 12 months to August was clothing and footwear, where prices fell by 1.2 percent on declines in the prices for women's clothing. Energy prices rose 0.8 percent following three consecutive months of year-over-year declines.The Bank of Canada's closely-watched core inflation rate - which strips out the prices of items such as gasoline, tobacco and some foodstuffs - dropped to 1.6 percent from 1.7 percent in July. Markets had expected the rate to fall to 1.5 percent.(Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Bernadette Baum)	2	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	2	2	1	1	1	3
