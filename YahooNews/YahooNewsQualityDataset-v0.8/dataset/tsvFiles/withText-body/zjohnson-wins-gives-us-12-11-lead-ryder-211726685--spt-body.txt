MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) — Zach Johnson delivered only the second point of the day for the Americans at the Ryder Cup, beating Graeme McDowell 2 and 1.The United States now leads Europe 12-11, and needs 2 ½ points to regain the cup. The Americans have the lead in two of the remaining five matches.It was McDowell who delivered the winning point for Europe at Celtic Manor two years ago, but he was no match for Johnson on Sunday. The 2007 Masters champion led from the first hole, and McDowell conceded when Johnson put his 35-footer for birdie to two feet on the par-3 17. Johnson shook hands with McDowell and then turned to the crowd, urging them to cheer for one of the Americans' few bright spots of the day.	2	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	1	2	1	2	2	2	2	4
