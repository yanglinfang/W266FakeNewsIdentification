News outlets could use it to broadcast voice interviews, celebrities could use it to interact with fans, politicians could use it for public statements and the average person could use it to simply say anything."We've seen the resistance to voice slowly crumble," Hayden says, predicting voice will become a mainstream medium online by 2014.
