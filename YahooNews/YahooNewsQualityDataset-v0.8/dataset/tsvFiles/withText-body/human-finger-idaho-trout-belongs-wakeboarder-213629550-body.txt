SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) â€” A human finger found inside a fish at Idaho's Priest Lake has been traced to a wakeboarder who lost four fingers in an accident more than two months earlier.Fisherman Nolan Calvin found the finger while he was cleaning the trout in early September. He put it on ice and called the Bonner County, Idaho, sheriff's office.The Spokesman-Review newspaper reports that detectives were able to get a fingerprint off the severed digit. They matched it to a fingerprint card for a 31-year-old man.Investigators learned that the man, Hans A. Galassi, lost four fingers from his left hand in a July 4 accident on the same lake where the fish was caught.The three other fingers have not been recovered.	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	1	2	3	4
