You know Apple has high expectations when selling more than five million iPhone 5s in three days still isn't enough to impress investors.Apple's stock opened at $686.91 on Monday, down nearly 2% from the previous close of $700.09, despite the seemingly awe-inspiring first weekend sales figures reported by the company this morning for the new iPhone.[More from Mashable: iPhone 5 Destroys Galaxy S 3 in Household Test Face-Off]So what happened?In the days leading up to the launch, several analysts predicted that Apple would sell roughly twice as many iPhone 5s in the opening weekend as it did with the iPhone 4S last year.

After seeing the long lines on launch day, Munster settled on 8 million as the number.[More from Mashable: 13 Free iPhone Apps to Make Life Easier]These and other analysts typically pointed out a couple key factors influencing their predictions: buzz for the iPhone 5 had really been building up for about two years, and the fact that Apple rolled out the new iPhone in two more countries than the iPhone 4S. More recently, Apple revealed that it received twice as many pre-orders for the iPhone 5 as it did for the iPhone 4S, further fueling speculation of blockbuster iPhone 5 sales.As it turned out, Apple still ended up having a record-setting launch, but opening weekend sales of the iPhone 5 were only about one million units higher than the opening weekend sales for the iPhone 4S last year. What's more, as Asymco analyst Horace Dediu points out, the iPhone 5 sold at roughly the same rate as the iPhone 4s when you normalize for the number of countries in which the phones were available over opening weekend.The reason for the lower-than-expected sales figures, according to Apple, appears to be limited supply. The company's CEO Tim Cook said Apple sold out of its initial inventory, though it continues to ship iPhone 5s to stores and take orders online.As of publication, Apple's stock had rebounded somewhat and was trading above $690 a share.This story originally published on Mashable here.	3	3	4	3	3	4	3	2	3	4	4	3	2	2	3	4
