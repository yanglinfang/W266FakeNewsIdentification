Approximately 40 people were injured and 20 were arrested when a massive riot broke out Sunday at Foxconn’s (2038) Taiyuan plant in Northern China. Details are still conflicting, however early reports from Engadget suggest the incident began after a security guard struck a worker during anti-Japan protests at around 10:00 p.m. local time on Sunday. The plant, which manufactures magnesium alloy components and LED lighting products, has been closed following the incident. Reports suggest as many as 2,000 workers were involved. Foxconn issued a preliminary statement suggesting the incident was triggered by “a fight among workers from different production lines,” but the company noted it is “still investigating the cause of the fight and the number of people involved.” A video of the riot follows below.ReadGet more from BGR.com: Follow us on Twitter, Facebook	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	4	2	3	1	1	2	3	4
