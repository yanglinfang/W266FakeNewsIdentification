Baxter is like most reliable employees -- he uses common sense to do his job, and works well with others -- except, he's a robot.To be precise, Baxter robots are a new line of androids that can apply common sense behavior in manufacturing workplaces.Developed by Boston-based Rethink Robotics, Baxter automatically adapts to changing environments through cameras, sensors and software that enable it to "'see' objects, 'feel' forces and 'understand' tasks," according to the company's website.For this reason, Rethink claims that Baxter robots can safely work alongside humans. They can also be trained like a person, with the robots capable of juggling multiple tasks, and learning a new one in less than 30 minutes (Check out the video above to see them in action).Priced at $22,000 and with no integration required, Baxter robots are "a fraction of the cost of a traditional industrial robot," according to Rethink. "Baxter was specifically designed to be affordable for mid-size and small manufacturers, companies that have never been able to afford robots before.""We [can] offer new hope to the millions of American manufacturers who are looking for innovative ways to compete in our global economy."The androids are ready to start work in less than one hour after they hit the factory floor, the company adds.Baxter is a complete, self-contained system with application software that can be updated. Rethink says it plans to offer a software development kit in early 2013 for those who want to make use of the technology.Unveiled Tuesday, the robots are available on pre-order; first product shipments will begin this October.Do you think Baxter robots will foster cooperation or competition?
