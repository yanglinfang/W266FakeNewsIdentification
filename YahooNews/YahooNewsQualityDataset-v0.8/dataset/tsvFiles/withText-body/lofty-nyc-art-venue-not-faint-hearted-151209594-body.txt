NEW YORK (AP) â€” The 810-square-foot living room offers spectacular views of mid-Manhattan. A 13-foot statue of Christopher Columbus stands amid the couches, lamps and coffee table.But the location isn't for the faint-hearted: You get there by climbing a 6-story, scaffold-covered staircase.The fake penthouse, called "Discovering Columbus," is the creation of Japanese artist Tatzu Nishi.The statue has been there since 1892, perched on top of a 70-foot column at Columbus Circle.Nishi put the big "living room" at the top of the column, right where Columbus stands.Mayor Michael Bloomberg says it's a rare opportunity to see the great explorer up close.Starting Thursday, 25 people at a time can enter the room. The installation runs through Nov. 18.	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	2	2	2	2	1	3	3
