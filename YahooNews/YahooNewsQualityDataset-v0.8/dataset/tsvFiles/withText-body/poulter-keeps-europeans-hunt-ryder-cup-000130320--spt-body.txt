MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) — Ian Poulter and Europe aren't ready to concede the Ryder Cup, winning the last two matches and bringing the American juggernaut to a screeching halt.The Americans still have a10-6 lead, but that looks tight compared to the blowout they were on the verge of only a few hours earlier Saturday. The U.S. needs 14 ½ points to regain the Ryder Cup. The largest comeback in Ryder Cup history was at Brookline in 1999, when the U.S. erased a 10-6 deficit on the final day."It's been done before," Europe captain Jose Maria Olazabal said.Don't count Europe out, not with Poulter. The excitable Englishman loves the Ryder Cup, and has his team's best winning percentage to back it up. He's now 11-3-0 in Ryder Cup play, and has had a hand in half of Europe's points so far.This might have been his best performance yet. Down 2 with six holes to play, Poulter made five straight birdies and he and Rory McIlroy stunned Jason Dufner and Zach Johnson 1 up. With his entire team watching, Poulter drained a 12-footer to clinch the match then let out a roar that might have been heard across the Atlantic.	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	3	2	3	4
