Senators. They're just like us, especially when it comes to delayed flights.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., launched a Twitter tirade against American Airlines Friday night after experiencing delay problems involving a flight to D.C.Rubio's rant started with this tweet and then proceeded to include eight more messages on Twitter:@marcorubio: Trying to get to DC for early morning votes tonight but let's just say this has not been the best week in American Airlines history.A sample of more of Rubio's tweets:@marcorubio: Delaying flight for "maintenance" to squeeze connectors from other flight, oldest trick in book.Feel bad for crew.#cmonman #AmericanAirlines@marcorubio: Since I am going off on #AmericanAirlines tonight, let me say pilots and flight attendants they have are top notch. #nottheirfault@marcorubio: I must now turn of my electronic device. I hope tonight's tirade didn't cost me my Executive Platinum status.American Airlines tried to apologize via Twitter to the senator.@AmericanAir: @marcorubio Thanks for your patience, Marco. We hope you have a great flight.	2	2	2	3	2	4	2	2	3	3	3	4	2	3	2	2
