CHICAGO (AP) â€” A joke by the satirical newspaper The Onion appears to have gotten lost in translation.An Iranian news agency has picked up as fact a story from the paper about a supposed survey showing a majority of white Americans would rather vote for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (ah-muh-DEE'-neh-zhahd) than President Barack Obama. The only trouble is it was made up, like everything in the just-for-laughs newspaper, which is headquartered in the comedic capital Chicago.The English-language service of Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency republished the story Friday, several days after it appeared in The Onion.The Iranian version is copied word-for-word from the original. It leaves out only The Onion's description of Ahmadinejad as "a man who has repeatedly denied the Holocaust and has had numerous political prisoners executed."	2	2	3	3	2	1	2	2	3	1	3	2	1	2	3
