Groupon has acquired online restaurant reservation and deals service Savored for an undisclosed sum, the company announced on Monday.[More from Mashable: ShoutAbout Aims to Inspire Social Action Based on News Stories]Savored, a New York startup, partners with more than 1,000 upscale restaurants to offer as much as 40% off the bill to customers who pay $10 in advance for a reservation. The acquisition could potentially help Groupon expand its high-end restaurant offerings. More importantly though, Savored's team and technology should give Groupon a better understanding of what businesses need in order to plan out and manage discounts offered in real time, a big issue for Groupon's instant deal service, Groupon Now."Savored's platform nicely complements Groupon's efforts in yield management, an area we've pioneered with Groupon Now!," said Dan Roarty, VP of Groupon Now, in a statement. "We look forward to working together to achieve a common goal -- making dining out even more fun and affordable for consumers while helping restaurateurs manage inventory and grow their businesses."[More from Mashable: This Startup Can Tell You if a Photo Is Fake]Groupon has been busy acquiring companies in recent months, including another restaurant deals startup Breadcrumb.
