Facebook (FB) has begun testing a new photo sync feature in its Android application that will automatically upload photos taken to the Web. The company’s photo sync service will store any picture taken with an Android device in a private “Synced from Phone” folder on Facebook. Once photos have been synced to the Web, users can then pick and choose which images should be shared with friends. The feature is similar to those found on Google+, Dropbox and Apple’s (AAPL) Photostream, all of which offer online photo syncing. Facebook is currently testing the feature with a small number of users and it is unclear if, or when, the social networking site will roll out photo sync globally.ReadGet more from BGR.com: Follow us on Twitter, Facebook	4	3	4	3	3	1	2	3	3	2	3	1	1	1	3	4
