A NATO spokeswoman confirmed only that the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber.Hospital officials said nine civilians were killed and 61 wounded.The blast followed the killing of two Americans on Sunday in an exchange of fire with Afghan forces that may have been the result of a misunderstanding, taking the death toll of U.S. military and civilian personnel to over 2,000 in the 11-year war.(Reporting by Elyas Wahdat; Writing by Rob Taylor; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	4	2	1	4	3	3
