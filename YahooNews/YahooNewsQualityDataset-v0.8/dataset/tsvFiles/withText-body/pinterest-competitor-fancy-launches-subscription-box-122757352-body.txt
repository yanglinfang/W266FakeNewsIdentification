The Fancy's trendy business model is getting even trendier: The site, often described as "Pinterest for shopping," announced the launch of a monthly subscription box service on Thursday.[More from Mashable: The ‘Pinterest for Ecommerce’ Now Pays You to Share]For $30 per month, subscribers are promised at least $60 worth of goods in a category of their choice. (The Fancy has not yet returned an e-mail asking for clarification about category selections.) The service is based on the model popularized by Birchbox, which sends subscribers four to five sample-sized beauty products for $10 per month.Like Pinterest, The Fancy encourages users -- COO Michael Silverman says there are nearly 2 million who have registered -- to save pictures of products, destinations, etc. It’s different from Pinterest in that there’s a strong shopping component. The site wants you to buy the items and services you fancy, or at least something similar. For example, if you were to “fancy” a picture of the YingXi Corridor of Stone Peaks in China, The Fancy would encourage you to book nights at a hotel near there.Over the weekend, The Fancy announced a joint promotion with American Express. When Cardmembers make a purchase of $100 more through The Fancy between now and the end of the month, they'll receive $20 back on their credit card statements. The statup also began offering a tool that enables multiple people to contribute to a group gift purchase.This story originally published on Mashable here.	3	4	3	4	4	4	2	2	3	4	3	1	2	1	4	4
