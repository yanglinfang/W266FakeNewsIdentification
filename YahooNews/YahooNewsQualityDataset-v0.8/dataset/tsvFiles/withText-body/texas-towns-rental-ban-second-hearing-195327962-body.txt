DALLAS (AP) â€” A Dallas suburb's long, expensive fight to ban illegal immigrants from renting homes is headed to a largely conservative panel of judges.Attorneys for Farmers Branch, Texas, as well as landlords and renters are scheduled to go before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday.Farmers Branch was sued four years ago after it passed an ordinance allowing the city building inspector to evict any illegal immigrant renters.A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit ruled against the city in March. The full court's decision to review the ruling is rare.The appeals court has directed all sides to focus on the U.S. Supreme Court's June ruling on Arizona's tough immigration law. It rejected major parts of the law, but upheld the so-called "show me your papers" requirement.	3	4	3	2	2	2	2	2	1	2	1	1	1	2	2	4
