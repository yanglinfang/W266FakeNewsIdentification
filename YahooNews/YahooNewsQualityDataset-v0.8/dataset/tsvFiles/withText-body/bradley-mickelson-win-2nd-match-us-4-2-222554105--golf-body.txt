MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) — Keegan Bradley couldn't have done much better in his Ryder Cup debut, winning both his matches with Phil Mickelson on Friday.Bradley and Mickelson's 2-and-1 victory over Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell, Europe's top team, gave the Americans a 4-2 lead, with two fourball matches left. Earlier, Bradley and Mickelson beat Sergio Garcia and Luke Donald, handing both the Europeans their first loss in foursomes.It is the first time Mickelson has won two matches in a day in Ryder Cup play. The pairing was so successful, Bradley joked that he wished they could play another 36 holes.Europe appeared poised for a big day in the morning, leading all four matches at one point. But Bradley's clutch putt swung the momentum in favor of the Americans. They finished the first session tied with the Europeans, then dominated the fourball matches.Bubba Watson and Webb Simspon made 10 birdies on their way to a 5-and-4 victory over Paul Lawrie and Peter Hanson, and Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar had a multi-hole lead over Justin Rose and Martin Kaymer.The only source of trouble was Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker — again.	4	4	4	3	3	2	3	2	2	4	3	1	2	1	3	4
