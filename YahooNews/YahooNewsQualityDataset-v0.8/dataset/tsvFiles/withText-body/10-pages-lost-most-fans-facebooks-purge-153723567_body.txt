Lady Gaga's Facebook page has lost the equivalent of three Madison Square Gardens packed full of little monsters this week.[More from Mashable: Instagram Now Has More Daily Active Users on Mobile Than Twitter [REPORT]]Facebook began removing fake likes from brand pages on the social network earlier this week as part of a continued effort to boost the site's integrity. As a result, Lady Gaga's page lost 65,505 fans from Tuesday through mid-Thursday, the third-highest drop in likes of any fan page, according to data provided to Mashable by FanPageList, which tracks numbers for official Facebook fan pages and Twitter accounts.FanPageList analyzed the top 500 pages on Facebook and found that seven of the ten pages that lost the most followers belonged to celebrities, including Rihanna, Shakira and Justin Bieber. The other three pages were for games: Texas Holdem, CityVille and Mafia Wars.[More from Mashable: Kenny Chesney Kicks Off His Shoes With New App]Texas Holdem's Facebook page lost nearly 200,000 fans in this time period, by far the biggest overall decline of any page. CityVille's page lost 72,631 fans, making it the second biggest decline.Don't feel too bad for these accounts though. When Facebook announced the decision to eliminate likes, it said brand pages would lose less than 1% of their total fans on average and sure enough, that appears to be the case. All of the brand pages in the top 10 lost fewer than one third of one percent of their total fans. Just a few brand pages in the top 500 lost between 1%-2% of their fans, including Breaking News and Air New Zealand.For the most part, it appears the worst of Facebook's like purge has passed. FanPageList found that most of these brands lost far fewer fans Thursday than during the previous two days. Some pages like those for Rihanna and Justin Bieber are actually back to adding fans today, rather than losing them.Here are the 10 pages that lost the most total fans this week following Facebook's purge:1. Texas Holdem Poker: -198,344 fans (-0.30%)2. CityVille: -72,631 fans (-0.29%)3. Lady Gaga: -65,505 fans (-0.12%)4. Rihanna: -49,861 fans (-0.08%)5. Shakira: -48,359 fans (-0.09%)6.
