Storing media in the cloud isn’t for everyone. For those who like keeping their files within reach on their smartphones and tablets, the need for high-capacity storage is a must. While most people will feel 64GB of storage on a smartphone or tablet is overkill, there will always be users who need more. Samsung (005930) announced this week that it has already begun mass producing “the industry’s highest density 128GB embedded NAND storage.” The chips are capable of reading data at 140MB/s and writing data at 50MB/s. “With 128GB of the new embedded memory storage, mobile handsets and tablet PCs can store up to 15 full HD, 8GB equivalent video files.” Samsung didn’t announce any new smartphones that will utilize the new 128GB chips yet, but it’s safe to say they will probably show up in a future revision of the Galaxy S smartphones or iPhone.ReadGet more from BGR.com: Follow us on Twitter, Facebook	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	4	2	2	1	1	2
