[More from Mashable: Watch These Epic iPhone 5 Vs. Android Music Videos]HTC has launched a new flagship Android device, the HTC One X+, which is basically a refresh (albeit quite a thorough one) of its powerful HTC One X device.When we reviewed the HTC One X in May 2012, we called it one of the best Android devices out there, and though Samsung's Galaxy S III has grabbed a big chunk of its spotlight, the One X is still a very powerful beast.[More from Mashable: Top 5 Apps Your Kids Will Love This Week]So, what can HTC do to best that device? Try a 1.7 GHz quad-core Nvidia Tegra 3 processor, 64GB of internal storage, and a 2,100 mAh battery. This monster combo should make the HTC One X+ up to 67% faster than its predecessor, along with giving it up to 6 hours (50%) more talk time.Alongside with One X+, HTC is also launching the latest version of its Sense UI, Sense 4+. This means the new flagship will also have several nifty software improvements, including "Tap and Go" pairing with Beats speakers and a self portrait camera mode.HTC is also launching HTC Get Started, a new web service that lets users easily set-up and personalize their mobile experience from a desktop web browser.As far as availability goes, the One X+ will be available in Europe and North Asia from October and in South Asia from November 2012. A separate announcement will be made for North America.HTC One S and X owners will be happy to know that they'll also get the Sense 4+ update starting October.This story originally published on Mashable here.	3	3	4	3	3	2	2	3	3	3	4	2	3	1	3	4
