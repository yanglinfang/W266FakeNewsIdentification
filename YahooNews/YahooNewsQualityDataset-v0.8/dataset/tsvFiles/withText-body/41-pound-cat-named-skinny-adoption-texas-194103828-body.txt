RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) — Don't be fooled by the name: Skinny the cat is one hefty feline. And all 41 pounds of her needs a home.A Dallas-area animal shelter has cared for the 5-year-old orange tabby since getting a call about a stray in a yard about a week ago.Kim Chapin with Richardson Animal Services said Friday that Skinny's "very sweet" — and the largest cat she's seen in 21 years with the shelter.Not surprising. U.S. government growth charts show Skinny weighs about as much as the average 4-year-old child.Chapin says Skinny appears healthy except for being overweight and likely having diabetes. Blood tests have been ordered.Chapin says somebody apparently had been caring for the cat but officials aren't sure who owned the huge kitty.	2	3	3	2	3	2	1	2	3	1	2	2	1	1	3	4
