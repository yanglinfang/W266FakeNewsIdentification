Because of Andy, I'm able to do power songs like "World Goes Round" in our Las Vegas show."— Marie Osmond."Andy Wiliams' smooth voice and casual style turned the songs he sang into timeless classics and made him one of America's top pop singers. ... The entertainment industry has lost a giant piece of its living history today, but Williams' legacy will forever be enshrined in the annals of music and television."— Statement from the Recording Academy."They didn't understand why Andy, who could live anywhere he wanted to live, would choose a rural community in southwest Missouri.
