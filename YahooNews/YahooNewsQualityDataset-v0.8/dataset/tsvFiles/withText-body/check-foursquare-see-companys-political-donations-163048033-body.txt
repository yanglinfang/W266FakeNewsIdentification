OpenSecrets.org, an independent campaign finance watchdog, provides those results.GeoPollster also assigns "partisan points" to its users, resulting in a score that the company says "help users understand how their spending habits subsidize politicians."We tested the app and found that GeoPollster's data was rather scant. For upwards of 200 check-ins, data was only available for two companies -- Whole Foods and Waffle House.GeoPollster has been around since October of 2010, but the check-in based donations information is a brand new feature.As the app's name implies, its primary intent is to do "location-based polling." Users can choose their political party and GeoPollster will then collect anonymous check-in data with the hopes of gleaning insight into the different habits of Democrats, Republicans and other voters.
