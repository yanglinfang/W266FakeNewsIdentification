ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Sudan and South Sudan signed deals on Thursday to secure their border and boost trade, a move which will restart crucial oil exports but fails to solve other conflicts left over from when the South seceded last year.The defense ministers of both countries signed a deal to set up a demilitarized buffer zone at the joint border after a five-day presidential summit in Addis Ababa, the seat of the African Union which has been brokering the talks.The security arrangement will allow South Sudan to restart oil exports through a Sudanese Red Sea port, giving both ailing economies a shot in the arm.(Reporting by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Yara Bayoumy and Pravin Char)	3	4	4	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	1	2	1	2	4
