AMSTERDAM (AP) â€” Police and prosecutors say they are investigating how rioting erupted after thousands of revelers descended on a small Dutch town for a party that was inadvertently advertised on Facebook.Authorities say 34 people were arrested Friday night and in the early hours of Saturday morning as rioters clashed with police in Haren, 185 kilometers (115 miles) north of Amsterdam.Mayor Rob Bats said Saturday: "Scum ran amok in our town."Dutch media reported that the party originally was planned as a small celebration by a 16-year-old girl but her invitation went viral when she posted it on Facebook.Some of the people arriving in Haren on Friday wore T-shirts emblazoned with "Project X Haren," a reference to the film "Project X" that portrayed an out-of-control party.	2	3	2	4	3	3	3	3	3	1	3	2	1	2	2	4
