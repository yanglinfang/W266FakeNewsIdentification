KADUNA, Nigeria (AP) â€” Hundreds of Muslims march peacefully through the streets of a northern Nigerian city to protest an anti-Islam film that denigrates the Prophet Muhammad.The march took place Monday in the city of Kaduna, where hundreds were killed in religious violence following Nigeria's 2011 presidential election. Those protesting left behind graffiti on walls reading: "Death to the Americans, Death to the Israelites."The protest comes after a series of protests have taken place in Nigeria, a nation largely split between a Christian south and a Muslim north. All the demonstrations have been peaceful, though one protest was broken up by soldiers firing into the air.The film, "Innocence of Muslims," has sparked protests around the world. American leaders have denounced the film, which is protected under U.S. free speech laws.	2	2	3	3	3	1	1	2	2	1	2	1	1	2	2	4
