BOSTON (AP) â€” Massachusetts officials say they have identified more than 1,100 defendants serving state sentences based at least partly on drug tests by a chemist accused of failing to follow protocols and mishandling samples in a now-closed state drug lab.David Meier, an attorney appointed to help sort through the legal quagmire, released the number on Monday. Officials say chemist Annie Dookhan was involved in testing more than 60,000 drug samples involving about 34,000 defendants.Meier says it's unclear how many of the cases might have been tainted. He says prosecutors and defense attorneys have been given the list because Gov. Deval Patrick has given priority to incarcerated people. Meier says lawyers must bring those cases before a judge.The state attorney general's office is conducting a criminal investigation. Dookhan hasn't been charged.	3	3	3	3	2	4	3	2	3	2	2	2	1	2	2	4
