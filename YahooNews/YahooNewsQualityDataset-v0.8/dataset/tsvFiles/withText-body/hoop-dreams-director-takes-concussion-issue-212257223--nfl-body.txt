CHICAGO (AP) â€” The director of "Hoop Dreams" is taking on the concussion crisis in sports with his latest film.Steve James calls concussions in sports a "huge public health issue," and says he hopes "Head Games" will educate parents and athletes and give them a foundation for when they're making decisions about contact sports. The 90-minute film features interviews with concussion guru Chris Nowinski and former NHL All-Star Keith Primeau, and blends the sometimes graphic science of concussions with personal stories of those struggling with their potentially devastating effects."Head Games" opens Friday in theaters in New York and Los Angeles. The movie also will be available on demand at iTunes and Amazon, as well as from some cable and satellite providers.	3	4	3	2	1	2	3	3	3	3	3	1	2	2	3	4
