The Maps application in iOS 6 is disappointing to say the least, and while Apple (AAPL) may be on a hiring spree to fix the problem, one iOS hacker has taken matters into his own hands. Ryan Petrich on Sunday posted a video that demonstrates the original Google Maps program from iOS 5 running on iOS 6. Petrich revealed that he would like to release the hack to the public, however it is not yet stable enough to do so. As expected, it is required that users have a jailbroken iPhone running iOS 6 for the port to be successful.
