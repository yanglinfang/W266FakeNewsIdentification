NEW YORK (AP) â€” Just as Fairway looks to go public, the grocery chain faces an unwanted visitor at one of its New York stores: Mice.Video footage at a Fairway store on Manhattan's Upper West Side shows a mouse in one of the store's open olive bins. The footage, shot after midnight on Wednesday inside the grocery store, was posted on a blog, MyUpperWest.com. It follows a posting earlier this month on the same blog that showed a rodent scurrying across the floor at the same store.Fairway says the incident was caused by "the massive construction that is happening throughout the immediate vicinity of the store."Fairway Group Holdings Corp. filed paperwork Monday to take its chain public. It has 11 stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.	3	3	3	1	2	2	2	2	1	2	1	1	1	1	2	4
