In the sequel, Dan Torrance, no longer a boy but a middle-aged man, is still haunted by his father's legacy and the horrific childhood year he spent at the Overlook Hotel, according to a synopsis of the book posted on the website.	1	1	2		4
He uses his gift - the shining - to comfort the dying in a New Hampshire town but his life is upset when he meets a 12-year-old girl who also has the shining and whom he "must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals," the website said.	1	2	2		4
