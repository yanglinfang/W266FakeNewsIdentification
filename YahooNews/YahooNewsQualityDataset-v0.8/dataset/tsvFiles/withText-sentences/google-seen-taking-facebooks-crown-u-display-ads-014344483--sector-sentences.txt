Google seen taking Facebook's crown in U.S. display ads	1	1	1		4
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc is set to become the biggest earner in U.S. display ads this year, taking the No. 1 rank away from Facebook Inc and cementing its dominant presence in online advertising.	1	2	2		4
Google's rising clout in display ads - the boxes with images and video found on websites -- has come on the back of growth in video advertising on its YouTube subsidiary, as well as mobile advertising through Admob, a company acquired by Google in 2009.	1	2	1		4
This year, Google will claim 15.4 percent of display ad dollars, or $2.31 billion, compared to Facebook's 14.4 percent, or $2.16 billion, according to projections by eMarketer, a digital advertising research firm.	2	2	1		4
But it added that publishers across the board have been bruised by weaker-than-expected display advertising demand this year as large brands withheld splurging on costly digital campaigns.	2	1	3		4
Top display ad earners Google and Facebook were followed by Yahoo Inc, Microsoft Corp and AOL Inc, which all have advertising networks across their digital content properties.	1	1	1		4
Facebook said this week that it would begin developing a mobile ad network that would allow advertisers to target ads using Facebook data across the web and not just Facebook's website.	1	1	1		4
