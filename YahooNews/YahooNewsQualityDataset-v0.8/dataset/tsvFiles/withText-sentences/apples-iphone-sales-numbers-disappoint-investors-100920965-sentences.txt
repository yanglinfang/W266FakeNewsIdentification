These and other analysts typically pointed out a couple key factors influencing their predictions: buzz for the iPhone 5 had really been building up for about two years, and the fact that Apple rolled out the new iPhone in two more countries than the iPhone 4S.	3	2	1		4
More recently, Apple revealed that it received twice as many pre-orders for the iPhone 5 as it did for the iPhone 4S, further fueling speculation of blockbuster iPhone 5 sales.	2	3	1		4
As it turned out, Apple still ended up having a record-setting launch, but opening weekend sales of the iPhone 5 were only about one million units higher than the opening weekend sales for the iPhone 4S last year.	2	2	2		4
What's more, as Asymco analyst Horace Dediu points out, the iPhone 5 sold at roughly the same rate as the iPhone 4s when you normalize for the number of countries in which the phones were available over opening weekend.	2	2	2		4
The reason for the lower-than-expected sales figures, according to Apple, appears to be limited supply.	3	1	2		4
The company's CEO Tim Cook said Apple sold out of its initial inventory, though it continues to ship iPhone 5s to stores and take orders online.	2	2	2		4
As of publication, Apple's stock had rebounded somewhat and was trading above $690 a share.	1	1	1		4
