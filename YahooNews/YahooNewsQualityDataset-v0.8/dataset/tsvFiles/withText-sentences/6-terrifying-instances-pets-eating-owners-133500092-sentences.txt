6 terrifying instances of pets eating their owners	2	1	3		
Staring at cute animals can do wonders for your mental health.	2	2	1		
But once in awhile, Mother Nature reveals her dark side, and adorable pets revert to their feral ancestries.	2	1	2		
A disturbing example: Recently, the grisly remains of an Oregon hog farmer were found in a pig pen where the man was last seen attending to his typically non-violent animals.	2	1	3		
And he's not alone.	1	1	1		
Here, six horrifying instances of pets eating their owners:	2	1	3		
1. PigsFamily members of 69-year-old Terry Vance Garner were shocked to discover the hog farmer's dentures and an undisclosed body part in the family's pig enclosure several hours after Garner went missing.	2	1	2		
Authorities think Garner either suffered a heart attack or was knocked over by the 700-pound animals before being killed and eaten.	2	1	3		
His brother describes the self-professed animal lover as a "good-hearted guy" whose animals were his life.	2	2	1

2. A hippoLast year, a 40-year-old former Army major was killed in South Africa after being savagely bitten to death by his pet hippopotamus, Humphrey.	1	1	3		
The man had adopted the 1.2-ton creature when it was just 5 months old, after the animal was rescued from a flood.	1	2	1		
"Humphrey's like a son to me, he's just like a human," he said.	2	1	1		
"There's a relationship between me and Humphrey and that's what some people don't understand."	1	1	1		
Experts have since noted that hippos are actually the most dangerous animals in Africa, killing more people each year than lions, elephants, leopards, buffalo, and rhinos combined.	1	1	3		
3. CatsIn 2010, dozens of cats had to be removed from a northwestern Pennsylvania home where coroners said the animals had started gnawing at the foot of a dead man, 74, and his deceased mother, 94.	1	1	3		
The man had apparently been the caretaker for his mother, who died of dehydration after her son suffered a heart attack.	3	1	3		
Left with no other source of food besides their owners' corpses, the cats' survival instincts apparently took over.	3	1	1

4. PugsIn 2009, a small pair of pugs in Nebraska survived for two weeks on the deceased corpse of their owner after he shot himself.	1	2	2		
After being found, the dogs were subsequently put up for adoption.	1	1	1		
A Humane Society spokesman said the animals were unlikely to suffer any lasting psychological damage because "they don't have memories like people."	2	2	1		
5. Burmese pythonIn 1996, a 19-year-old Bronx man died after being attacked by his pet Burmese python.	1	1	3		
It's likely that the 13-foot-long reptile mistook the man for food after it escaped its cage.	3	1	1		
The man was found by his neighbors in a pool of blood with the snake coiled around his torso in his apartment building's hallway.	1	1	3		
According to the man's brother, the victim had purchased the snake at a local pet store for $300 a few months earlier.	2	1	1

6. Lizards, tarantulas, spiders, and other bugsLoner Voegel, 30, lived in 2007 in a small German apartment in the city of Dortmund with a small zoo of more than 200 snakes, geckos, and insects.	1	1	1		
Apparently, he was killed by a black widow bite and subsequently gorged upon by the other crawly creatures.	3	1	3		
Neighbors alerted police after the stink emitting from his home became too unbearable.	1	1	2		
"It was like a horror movie," says Britain's The Sun.	2	1	2		
They found the man's corpse on the sofa with large chunks of flesh missing.	1	1	3		
"Giant webs draped him, spiders were all over him.	2	1	1		
They were coming out of his nose and mouth," said police.	1	1	1
