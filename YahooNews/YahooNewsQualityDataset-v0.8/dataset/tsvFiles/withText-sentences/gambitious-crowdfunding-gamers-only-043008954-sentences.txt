A new crowdfunding platform that focuses solely on video games launched Tuesday morning, and offers gamers a chance to invest in titles vetted by a team of industry experts.	1	2	1		3

Gambitious functions like a donation-based platform, such as Kickstarter.	1	1	1		3
It allows people living in the European Union and eventually the U.S. to invest equity into games, and receive returns on their investment.	1	2	1		3
Unlike Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, however, Gambitious doesn't let just anyone submit a project for funding.	1	1	1		3
The company's staff must first meet with the game's creators to make sure they have a working business plan and solid roadmap for their project before going forward.	1	1	1		3
Gambitious founders Mike Wilson and Harry Miller say they are worried about the future of crowdfunding for games, and want to make sure potential backers don't get burned out.	1	1	2		3

"We're starting to see press about the backlash about people getting sick of being hit up for donations.	1	1	1		3
A lot of these games are never going to come out.	1	1	2		3
A lot of these guys have never done it before, and they have no publishing or platform connections.	1	1	2		3
They have no publishers backing them, and they have no idea what it actually means to finish and ship a game," says Wilson, who has spent almost two decades in the industry.	1	1	3		3
He previously worked at companies such as id Software, Gathering of Developers and Gamecock Media Group.	1	1	1		3
Much of this Kickstarter gold rush has to do with developer Double Fine's uber-successful campaign to make a point-and-click adventure game.	1	1	1		3
The company raised $3.3 million back in February, and Kickstarter has said seven of the first 10 projects to reach the $1 million funding goal were game-related.	1	1	1		3
Miller says quick success has given independent developers big dreams, but adds that they may not have the ability or money to fulfill them all.	1	2	2		3
Many costs that crop up later surprise the developers, he says, such as marketing, or even creating special rewards for Kickstarter backers.	1	2	1		3
"Every little thing costs money.	1	1	1		3
It hurts them terribly in the end, when they didn't plan for it."	1	1	2		3
Cosmic DJ is one of the titles looking for funding at Gambitious' launch.	1	1	1		3
It's a unique music-tablet game that challenges players to try and create better music than their friends.	1	1	1		3
Matt Piersall, who is working on the game, says that when the developers realized they needed funding, Kickstarter didn't seem like a great option.	1	1	2		3
"It's really hard to get noticed on Kickstarter, and it's a full-time job of the developer to make sure the campaign runs smoothly," he says.	1	1	2		3
With Gambitious, Wilson and Miller say their goal is to make sure smaller developers, especially first-timers, understand what they are getting into, while also making sure the game's consumers can donate or invest in a basic business plan, at minimum.	1	1	1		3
"It's not to say that a team of inexperienced people can't do this, but we want to make sure they have a plan," Wilson says, adding that Gambitious already has contracts with marketing, public relations, voice acting and music services.	1	1	1		3
The duo will soon have another group to educate: potential investors.	1	1	1		3
Wilson says the passage of the JOBS Act means that it will only be a few months before U.S. residents can invest in private companies.	1	1	1		3
Investors on Gambitious can only invest in the game the company is making -- not the developers themselves -- but they can still get returns if a game sells well.	1	2	1		3
"The average age for a gamer each year goes up; now it's near 40.	1	1	1		3
People near 40 invest while having more money in their pockets.	1	2	1		3
Why not invest in something that you're passionate in?" Wilson says.	1	1	1		3
Gambitious launched seven projects from around Europe and the United States, with plans to add more.	1	2	1		3
Wilson says he expects to see a big push when investment opportunities open to the U.S. For now, anyone outside the EU can use the site in the same way they would any other crowdfunding platform.	1	2	1		3
While developers may find the application more stringent than other crowdfunding sites, Wilson says he hopes they will see the reasoning behind it.	1	2	1		3
"We ask them to create a business plan to go with their project.	1	1	1		3
It'd be same if they were pitching an investor for any idea.	1	1	1		3
Anyone can fill out the application and submit a business plan.	1	2	1		3
It's not for us to know if things would sell, but we make them think it through."	1	1	1		3
