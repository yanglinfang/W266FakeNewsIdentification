More importantly though, Savored's team and technology should give Groupon a better understanding of what businesses need in order to plan out and manage discounts offered in real time, a big issue for Groupon's instant deal service, Groupon Now.	2	2	1		5
"Savored's platform nicely complements Groupon's efforts in yield management, an area we've pioneered with Groupon Now!," said Dan Roarty, VP of Groupon Now, in a statement.	1	1	1		5
