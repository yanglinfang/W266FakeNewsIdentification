Facebook began removing fake likes from brand pages on the social network earlier this week as part of a continued effort to boost the site's integrity.	2	4	1		
As a result, Lady Gaga's page lost 65,505 fans from Tuesday through mid-Thursday, the third-highest drop in likes of any fan page, according to data provided to Mashable by FanPageList, which tracks numbers for official Facebook fan pages and Twitter accounts.				I	
FanPageList analyzed the top 500 pages on Facebook and found that seven of the ten pages that lost the most followers belonged to celebrities, including Rihanna, Shakira and Justin Bieber.	1	2	1		
The other three pages were for games: Texas Holdem, CityVille and Mafia Wars.	1	2	1

Texas Holdem's Facebook page lost nearly 200,000 fans in this time period, by far the biggest overall decline of any page.	1	1	2		
CityVille's page lost 72,631 fans, making it the second biggest decline.	1	1	2		
Don't feel too bad for these accounts though.	5	3	1	S	
When Facebook announced the decision to eliminate likes, it said brand pages would lose less than 1% of their total fans on average and sure enough, that appears to be the case.	3	4	1		
All of the brand pages in the top 10 lost fewer than one third of one percent of their total fans.	1	4	1		
Just a few brand pages in the top 500 lost between 1%-2% of their fans, including Breaking News and Air New Zealand.	1	3	2		
For the most part, it appears the worst of Facebook's like purge has passed.	3	3	1		
FanPageList found that most of these brands lost far fewer fans Thursday than during the previous two days.	4	3	1		
Some pages like those for Rihanna and Justin Bieber are actually back to adding fans today, rather than losing them.	4	4	1
