LONDON (Reuters) - Talks between BP and the U.S. government over a settlement for the 2010 oil spill have stalled because the U.S. is insisting that the British oil giant pay at least $18 billion, British newspaper the Sunday Times reported.	1	1	2		4
A settlement deal may not happen until early next year, the newspaper quoted sources close to the company as saying.	1	1	1		4
A settlement between $18 billion to $21 billion is near the level which BP would be required to pay should it be found grossly negligent under the Clean Water Act, said the paper.	1	1	1		4
BP, which declined to comment on the story, has always denied any liability for the United States' worst offshore environmental disaster.	1	1	3		4
Reports in July suggested that the U.S. was looking for a settlement of $25 billion.	1	1	1		4
The newspaper said that BP's board is split over whether to pay $18 billion or continue to push for a settlement at $15 billion, the level it is widely reported to be hoping to settle at.	1	1	1		4
