If I produced election night coverage	1	1	1		3
This is an assignment memorandum for the producers of election night coverage.	1	1	1		3
I feel I am modestly qualified to make these assignments because of my past experience covering politics at the network level, and because this year, I might well be — for the first time — a viewer.	3	1	1		3
The great gadgets and graphics and gimmicks are fun to watch.	3	1	1		3

But there are a couple of dynamic data points that everyone who has followed the race closely and those who are just tuning it for the drama will want to know.	2	1	1		3
The three Big Stories of the night are obvious: Will Obama get re-elected?	2	1	1		3
Will Republicans take control of the Senate?	1	1	1		3
Will they hang on to the House?	1	1	1		3

If I were producing the coverage, I'd make sure that, at all times in the lower third of the screen space, we'd have a graphic showing the current and projected advantage for Republicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate.	3	1	1		3
These numbers ought to be automatically updated to reflect new projections.	3	1	1		3
That is, let's say that it's 9:00 p.m. ET, and based on the races that have been called and projected so far, Democrats are clinging to a one-seat Senate majority.	2	1	1		3
Right now, Democrats have a four-seat edge (two independents caucusing as Democrats, the vice presidential tie breaker, and 51 seats to their name).	1	1	1		3
So the two data points that could be useful right at that moment would show the current composition (53) and the projected composition (51).	2	1	1		3
But the more accurate graphic would show how many seats Republicans need to win to flip the chamber.	2	1	1		3
And that's four, not three.	1	1	1		3
So producers: Your graphic should look something like this.	3	1	1		3
It should be on screen at all times, or rotated with the House control graphic, which I'll describe next.	3	1	1		3
U.S. SENATE				i	3
SEE ALSO: The NFL needs to give in, now				i	3
NOW: D +4				i	3
PROJECTED: D+2				i	3
SEE ALSO: The American ambassador to Libya is murdered				i	3
The House graphics are a bit more complicated.	2	1	1		3
Republicans control 242 seats and Democrats control 193.	1	1	1		3
But this tells the casual viewer very little.	2	1	1		3
Republicans have a 25-seat advantage in the House.	1	1	1		3
So the House graphic would read:	2	1	1		3
NOW: R+25				i	3
SEE ALSO: The dead cat lives				i	3
PROJECTED: R+12				i	3
The font would be slightly different for the projected make-up, and it would attest to its dynamic status.	2	1	1		3
Since polls in Hawaii and Alaska don't close until very late, networks have to use projections.	3	1	1		3
What makes the second part of the graphic interesting is that it can be updated in real-time to reflect House projections and real-vote returns that come in.	2	2	1		3
(All networks use essentially the same computer back-end to crunch the numbers; their projection models differ slightly based on the political scientists and analysts who serve on the decision desks.)	1	1	1		3
As the PROJECTED number is updated, it can flash — and anchors/reporters can explain (briefly) why the projection has changed, and perhaps the races that have been called can also flash on the screen.	1	1	1		3
The graphic does not perfectly correspond to the 435 individual House elections because some can't be called even though the winner might be obvious.	1	1	1		3
But the computer models will take the safe seats into account and the human modelers will make responsible projections.	1	1	1		3

Now, to the presidency.	1	1	1		3
The magic number is 270 electoral votes.	1	1	1		3
There are two ways to handle this.	1	1	1		3
One is to simply show the projected electoral votes for each candidate in real-time.	1	1	1		3
CURRENT EV (269 NOT CALLED)	1	1	1		3
SEE ALSO: Welcome to The Compass				i	3
ROMNEY + 145	1	1	1		3
OBAMA + 124	1	1	1		3
SEE ALSO: The president for the upper half				i	3
Another would show how many EVs are needed.	1	1	1		3
TO WIN (300 of 538 NOT CALLED)	1	1	1		3
SEE ALSO: When a gaffe isn't				i	3
ROMNEY needs 100	1	1	1		3
OBAMA needs 29	1	1	1		3
SEE ALSO: No easy answers for No Easy Day				i	3
Another rotating graphic could show SCENARIOS to victory.	3	1	1		3
They'd be in shorthand:	1	1	1		3
ROMNEY'S PATH NOW: WINNING OH, CO, NV, AND NM	1	1	1		3
SEE ALSO: Why Apple's events matter				i	3
OBAMA'S PATH NOW: WINNING CO AND NV, OR IA AND NV	1	1	1		3
But here's where networks can get creative.	1	1	1		3
SEE ALSO: Apparently, it's not just the economy (stupid?)				i	3
They'll have data to show where lies the outstanding vote, and in each state, it is fairly easy to write a formula that allows an anchor to say something like: "In Ohio, about 14,000 votes separate President Obama from Mitt Romney, but Romney needs to win about 56 percent of the outstanding precincts — precincts that tend to give Republicans 60 percent of their vote.				i	3
So Ohio looks good for Romney, based on the turnout models that we have."	2	2	1		3
On screen, you'd see:	1	1	1		3
OHIO (18 EVs)	1	1	1		3

-----------------				i	3
At this point, John King, Chuck Todd, and their maps can go to town.	2	1	1		3
But rarely do networks actually quantify the projected outstanding vote in states, and I don't know why.	3	1	2		3
They have the data (I've seen it), and it anchors the drama of the night in reality.	2	1	1		3
The exit poll data and the real-vote tracking ability of the networks is truly awesome on election night, and for the sake of viewers, I think it ought to be incorporated into the graphical crawls more easily.	3	1	1		3
Technically, there are no impediments.	2	1	1		3
But producers need to think through these things in advance as they figure out how to tell the story on election night, a story that is largely numerical.	3	1	1		3
