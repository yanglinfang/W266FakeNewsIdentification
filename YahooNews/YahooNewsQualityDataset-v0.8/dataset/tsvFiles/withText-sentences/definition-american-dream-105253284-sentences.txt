The New Definition of the American Dream	1	2	1		4
The siren call of the American dream may not be as powerful as it once was, but we are still a nation of believers, new research shows.	2	2	2		4
Like the American population, the demographics of those who believe in the dream have changed over time.	1	1	1		4
But the majority of us still believe the U.S. is a place where anyone can achieve fame and fortune.	3	3	1		4
In fact, fame and fortune have replaced faith and family as the linchpins of the American dream, a survey of more than 500 U.S. adults over 18 discovered.	1	3	1		4
The survey was conducted by JWT, a marketing communications company.	1	1	1		4
Almost two-thirds of Americans said the dream is different from what it used to be.	1	1	1		4
The country is moving away from traditional notions of the ideal life — one centered around community and family, with religious faith and middle-class values as the guiding ethos — toward one focused on making and spending money and winning recognition, the survey found.				I	4
While the dream is very much alive and attainable, achieving it is more of a challenge, the survey found.	1	3	2		4
Almost 7 in 10 respondents said the dream became harder to realize for middle-class people in the past five to 10 years, up from 4 in 10 in 2008.	1	1	2		4
And some hold the conviction that white, native-born Americans have the cards stacked against them, even though statistics indicate otherwise.	2	1	2		4
The exceptionalism of the American dream is also being questioned by younger Americans.	2	1	1		4
While a majority of older generations believe the dream is unique, only 4 in 10 millennials hold that view.	1	2	2		4
Despite everything, though, belief in the dream endures, dented though it may be.	2	2	2		4
"While the dream is losing its luster, and Americans recognize that it's becoming significantly harder to achieve, the concept endures; 7 in 10 still believe in the idea, not much fewer than in 2008," said Ann Mack, JWT's director of trendspotting.	2	2	2		4
