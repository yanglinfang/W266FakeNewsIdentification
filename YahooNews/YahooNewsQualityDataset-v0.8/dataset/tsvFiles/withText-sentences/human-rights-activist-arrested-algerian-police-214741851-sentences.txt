The daily El Watan reported that Zaid would go on trial Monday for "humiliating" and "striking a police officer."	1	1	3		4
The paper quoted an eyewitness, Abdelmalek Aibek Eg Sahli, a representative of a hotel union, as saying that Zaid "wasn't aggressive and I don't see why he is accused of that."	2	1	2		4
Amine said in an interview with The Associated Press that police often use "verbal aggression" to justify an arrest.	2	1	2		4
Zaid, a well-known blogger, is a member of the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights.	2	1	1		4
