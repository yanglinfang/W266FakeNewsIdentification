Buddhist statue found by Nazis made from meteorite	1	1	1		4
BERLIN (AP) — An ancient Buddhist statue that a Nazi expedition brought back from Tibet shortly before World War II was carved from a meteorite that crashed on Earth thousands of years ago.	1	1	1		4
What sounds like an Indiana Jones movie plot appears to have actually taken place, according to European researchers publishing in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science this month.	2	2	1		4
Elmar Buchner of the University of Stuttgart said Thursday the statue was brought to Germany by the Schaefer expedition.	1	1	1		4
The Nazi-backed venture set out for Tibet in 1938 in part to trace the origins of the Aryan race — a cornerstone of the Nazis' racist ideology.	1	1	2		4
The existence of the 10.6-kilogram (23.4-pound) statue, known as "iron man," was only revealed in 2007 when its owner died and it came up for auction, Buchner told The Associated Press.	2	1	2		4
German and Austrian scientists were able to get permission from its new owner, who wasn't disclosed, to conduct a chemical analysis that shows the statue came from the Chinga meteorite, which crashed in the area of what is now the Russian and Mongolian border around 15,000 years ago.	1	2	1		4
The meteorite was officially discovered in 1913, but Buchner said the statue could be 1,000 years old and represent a Buddhist god called Vaisravana.	1	1	1		4
The Nazis were probably attracted to it by a left-facing swastika symbol on its front.	1	1	1		4
The swastika has been used by various cultures throughout the ages, but the Nazis tried to appropriate it as the symbol of their ideology, going so far as to put a right-facing version of it on their red and white flag.	2	1	2		4
Scientists not involved in the study told the AP that the research linking the statue to the meteorite was credible.	1	2	1		4
"Looks like a solid piece of geochemical 'forensic' work," said Qing-Zhu Yin, a researcher in geology at the University of California, Davis.	2	2	1		4
"No terrestrial artifact would generally contain that much nickel content.	1	2	1		4
Chemical elements don't lie."	2	1	1		4
Rhian Jones, an associate professor at the University of New Mexico who specializes in meteorites, said the claim appeared conclusive.	2	2	1		4
"There is a clear and convincing argument that the meteorite the statue is made from is the Chinga iron meteorite," she said.	2	2	1		4
But Yin cast doubt on the claim that the statue represented a Buddhist deity.	2	1	2		4
"I am not a historian.	1	1	2		4
But the 'iron man' does not look like a Buddha to me from my cultural background," he said.	2	1	2		4
"It looks more like a warrior with a sword ... (a) resemblance of Genghis Khan.	1	1	1		4
... I have never seen a Buddha with a sword or knife."	1	1	1		4
