Investigators took reports from both Lohan, 26, and the man, but charges appeared unlikely, said a spokeswoman for the New York City Police Department.	2	1	2		4
A misdemeanor assault charge filed earlier in the day against the man was dropped, the spokeswoman said.	1	1	2		4
Police declined to confirm local media reports identifying the man as Christian LaBella, 25, of California, a staffer with Congressman John Shimkus, an Illinois Republican.	1	1	2		4
"Nobody's been arrested, there's no assault," the police spokeswoman told Reuters.	1	2	2		4
"Reports were taken and both parties were able to give their account of what took place."	1	1	1		4
Lohan's spokesman Steve Honig earlier in the day said Lohan suffered minor injuries in what he described as an attack, and said her assailant was arrested.	2	1	2		4
"Lindsay was victim of an assault," Honig said.	3	1	3		4
"She does not face any charges."	1	2	1		4
Celebrity website TMZ.com, citing sources close to the actress, identified the attacker as a man Lohan met at a New York nightclub.	1	1	2		4
The two began arguing in Lohan's hotel room after she noticed he was taking pictures of her with his cellphone, TMZ and E! News reported.	1	1	2		4
Lohan told police the man threw her to the ground, climbed on top of her and tried to choke her before someone else pulled him off, TMZ said.	3	1	4		4
Honig declined comment on the media reports.	1	1	2		4
The actress, who has been in and out of court, rehab and prison in recent years, was arrested in New York last week after a pedestrian told police that her car had struck him in an alley.	1	1	3		4
She was charged with leaving the scene of an accident, a misdemeanor.	1	1	3		4
