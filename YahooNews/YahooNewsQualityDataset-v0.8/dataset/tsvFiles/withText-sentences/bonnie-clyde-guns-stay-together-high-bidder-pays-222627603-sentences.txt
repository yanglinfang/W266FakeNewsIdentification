LITTLETON, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Two pistols found on the bodies of famed Depression-era outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow after they were killed by a posse in 1934 have sold at auction on Sunday for 311,900 pounds.	2	2	2		4
A snub-nosed .38 special found taped to the inside of Parker's thigh with white medical tape fetched $264,000 (163,376 pounds) at an auction in Nashua, New Hampshire.	1	2	1		4
A Colt .45				S	4
recovered from the waistband of Barrow's pants was purchased for $240,000.	1	2	1		4
The guns owned by Parker, who died at age 23, and Barrow, who was 25, were purchased by a Texas collector who wished to remain anonymous.	1	1	1		4
"They're still iconic and their love story kind of resonates," said Bobby Livingston, vice president of RR Auction, the company that conducted the sale.	2	3	1		4
"We have a romanticized vision of Bonnie and Clyde."	2	2	2		4
The hunt for the outlaw lovers captured the nation's imagination during the depths of the Great Depression.	2	2	2		4
The duo were believed to have committed 13 murders and numerous bank robberies, kidnappings and car thefts during a cross-country crime spree from 1932 to 1934.	2	1	4		4
Their fame was heightened by their practice of leaving glamorous photos of themselves at crime scenes, including one of Parker smoking a cigar.	2	2	2		4
A popular 1967 movie, "Bonnie and Clyde," a somewhat romanticized account of the couple's career starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, was critically acclaimed for its frank presentation of sex and violence.	2	2	3		4
Among other crimes, the two are thought to have killed police officers in Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma.	1	1	4		4
They were also suspected of staging a prison break in Waldo, Texas, that left two prison guards dead in 1934.	2	1	3		4
A posse of Texas Rangers and Louisiana police killed the two in an early morning ambush in northern Louisiana in May of that year.	1	2	2		4
The guns auctioned off came from the estate of memorabilia collector Robert Davis, who had purchased them in 1986 for about $50,000 each, Livingston said.	1	1	1		4
A gold pocket watch found on Barrow's body sold for $36,000.	1	1	1		4
Other items included a 1921 Morgan silver dollar taken from Barrow's jacket fetched $32,400, and one of Parker's silk stockings, taken from the couple's car after their death, which went for $11,400.	1	1	2		4
