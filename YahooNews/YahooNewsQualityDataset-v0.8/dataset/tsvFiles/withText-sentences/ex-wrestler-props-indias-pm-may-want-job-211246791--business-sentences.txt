Ex-wrestler props up India's PM, but he may want the job	2	2	1		4
LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - As a former wrestler, Mulayam Singh Yadav has got India's government where he likes it - in a vice-like grip.	2	2	1		4
The ructions over fresh economic reforms that reduced the ruling coalition to a parliamentary minority last month left Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dependent on this wheeler-dealer from the country's dusty northern plains.	2	2	1		4
In an interview with Reuters, Yadav insisted there were no strings attached to his support for Singh's Congress party, just a desire to keep the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power.	3	2	1		4
"We are supporting them," he said in the Hindi language, looking hearty for his 72 years despite rumors earlier this year that his health was failing.	3	2	2		4
"There are no conditions of any kind, it's only to ensure communal forces do not get strengthened."	3	2	2		4
However, Yadav is at least as well known for his maneuvering as he was in his youth for pinning opponents down in a wrestling bout: Congress party leaders know he cannot be trusted to stick with them through thick and thin - and few are convinced when he denies any ambition to one day become prime minister.	3	2	2		4
For now, the 22 lawmakers of Yadav's Samajwadi (Socialist) Party will side with the government, ensuring it can muster the 272 votes needed in parliament to prevent its collapse.	2	2	2		4
Their support became crucial after another regional party leader left the coalition, angry over hikes in the price of subsidized fuel and a decision to open India's doors to foreign supermarket giants.	3	2	3		4
Yadav's take on the reforms is that he opposes them, but will nevertheless continue to support the government.	2	2	2		4
"We will oppose anything that goes against the interests of the people," he said.	3	3	1		4
"But we will not allow the government to fall."	3	2	1		4
A FAMILY BUSINESS	1	1	1		4
Yadav was born to a rural family in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state with 200 million people and - since it sends more lawmakers to Delhi than any other - its politically most important.	2	2	1		4
As a young man, he trained as a wrestler before being attracted to socialism and local politics, eventually becoming chief minister of the state three times and federal defense minister in a coalition government during the 1990s.	1	1	1		4
Six months ago, when his Samajwadi Party returned to power in Uttar Pradesh after a hiatus, Yadav stood aside for his son Akhilesh to head the state government.	1	1	1		4
That, and what was perhaps a bout of ill-health, set off reports he was seriously ill and no longer well enough to hold office.	2	1	2		4
"I am fine," Yadav said at his sprawling colonial bungalow in Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh.	2	2	1		4
Impeccably dressed in the starched white dhoti-kurta of the region and his salt-and-pepper hair still damp from a mid-morning bath, he showed few signs of age as he strode out from under the porch of his home, chatting with aides and party colleagues.	3	3	1		4
"Those were just rumors.	3	2	1		4
I went on the campaign trail and I am fine now."	3	2	1		4
In India, where caste and family play hugely important roles in politics, the Yadavs have several advantages.	2	2	1		4
They are from a land-owning lower caste whose members were mostly subsistence farmers and cattle herders, but have become wealthier, more politically aware and socially assertive in recent decades.	2	2	2		4
Yadav, his daughter-in-law Dimple, a cousin and a nephew are in the federal parliament.	1	2	1		4
A brother is in the Uttar Pradesh state government headed by Akhilesh.	1	2	1		4
On the negative side, the party is anathema for other lower caste groups.	2	1	2		4
Critics also say it is tarred by association with people who have criminal pasts, and previous Samajwadi Party rule in Uttar Pradesh brought rampant corruption and increased violence.	2	1	3		4
The other family firmly entrenched in Indian politics is the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has ruled the country for a majority of the years since independence in 1947, and also looks on Uttar Pradesh as its base.	2	2	1		4
Akhilesh is often compared to the scion of that dynasty, Rahul Gandhi, whose Congress party was burned by the Samajwadi win in the Uttar Pradesh elections earlier this year.	2	2	2		4
He dismisses talk of rivalry or probable cooperation.	2	2	2		4
"He is a new leader, a nice man, a youth leader," Akhilesh said in a separate interview.	3	3	1		4
"We are of the same age.	2	1	1		4
His party should give him an opportunity."	3	2	1		4
INDIA'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER?	1	1	1		4
Although the Congress party-led coalition could coax other parties to keep it alive, for now it is dependent on Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is widely expected to demand a pound of flesh despite his professed unconditional support.	2	2	1		4
News reports have said he will press for an illegal wealth case against him to be dropped, and for impoverished Uttar Pradesh to get more federal aid.	3	2	2		4
Longer term, Yadav could be preparing to form a "Third Front" government, an amalgam of smaller parties that keeps out both Congress and BJP after national elections due by mid-2014.	3	1	1		4
Analysts and voter surveys suggest no clear winner will emerge in those polls, meaning the Third Front may well have the parliamentary numbers to stake a claim to power.	2	2	1		4
Since Yadav's party won Uttar Pradesh with a large majority, odds are he will have enough lawmakers in parliament after the 2014 elections to put him in pole position to form a coalition, and to head it.	2	2	1		4
Asked if Yadav could become prime minister, Sudha Pai, a political scientist who is rector at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said: "He knows how to make a deal, how to get on with other political parties.	3	3	1		4
He is very good at negotiating, he is the traditional Indian politician."	3	3	1		4
Yadav dismisses such ambitions: "I have never been a candidate for prime ministership, and I am not now," he said.	3	1	1		4
But the murmurs in his party, where he is called Netaji, or leader, are growing.	2	1	1		4
"No political party has a leader who is from a village or is a farmer," said Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary.	3	1	2		4
"This is a nation of villagers and farmers and Netaji represents 70 percent of the country."	3	2	1		4
THE YOUNGER YADAV	1	1	1		4
The Samajwadi Party, which is more or less restricted to Uttar Pradesh, cannot expect to get anything near a parliamentary majority on its own, but its workers say it can clinch up to 60 of the state's 80 parliamentary seats.	3	2	2		4
It could be joined by other regional parties and left-wing groups and even a section of the Congress party could be won over to cobble a majority, analysts say.	3	2	1		4
Akhilesh, the son and new chief minister, says governing Uttar Pradesh is as important to him as increasing numbers in parliament.	3	2	1		4
"It's not enough to say that because we won the state elections so well, we will get more MPs," he said.	3	2	1		4
"I have to perform, and if people believe that my government has performed well, then the result will be good.	3	3	1		4
"My priority is Uttar Pradesh," said the 39-year-old, a contrast, at least on the surface, to his politician father.	3	2	1		4
The younger Yadav speaks fluent English, is tech-savvy, and studied in Australia.	2	3	1		4
He was trained as an environment engineer and was once a keen footballer and Manchester United supporter.	2	2	1		4
Now he says, politics consume him almost completely.	3	2	1		4
"If we go to the center, Netaji will go there (and) some of our senior leadership, but I am happy in the state," he said, adding the party was not looking to topple Prime Minister Singh.	3	3	1		4
His father is similarly cautious.	2	2	1		4
"In 2014, Samajwadi will fight on its own strength, there will be no understanding with anyone," he said.	3	2	1		4
"After the elections, things (alliances) happen, nothing happens before.	3	2	1		4
Depending on the circumstances, we will take decisions then."	3	2	1		4
