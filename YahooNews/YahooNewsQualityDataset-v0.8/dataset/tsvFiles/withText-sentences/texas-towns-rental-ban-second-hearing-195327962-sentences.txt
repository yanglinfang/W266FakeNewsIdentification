Attorneys for Farmers Branch, Texas, as well as landlords and renters are scheduled to go before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday.	2	1	1		4
Farmers Branch was sued four years ago after it passed an ordinance allowing the city building inspector to evict any illegal immigrant renters.	1	1	2		4
