Behind closed doors, Romney gossips, imitates Kissinger	2	2	2		4
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The surreptitious video recording of a fundraiser held for Republican Mitt Romney in May provided a rare glimpse of how he views supporters of President Barack Obama - as government dependents.	3	1	3		4
It also provided an equally novel sight of a relaxed Romney doing an impression of Henry Kissinger, dishing about late-night television talk show host David Letterman, and receiving some pointed tips for his presidential campaign.	3	2	2		4
"I saw Dr. Kissinger," Romney says on the video, recounting a meeting in New York with the former U.S. secretary of state.	3	2	1		4
"I said to him, 'How are we perceived around the world?'	3	1	1		4
And he said one word: 'Veak!'"	3	1	2		4
The secretly filmed recording, released in its entirety by the liberal Mother Jones magazine on Tuesday, opened a window on how Romney acts during the kind of private meeting with donors that is helping to propel the most expensive presidential campaign in U.S. history.	2	2	2		4
In this case the former Massachusetts governor and private equity executive was speaking to donors who paid $50,000 each for the privilege of his company at a private dinner at the Boca Raton, Florida, home of financier Marc Leder.	1	1	1		4
Family and friends often say that Romney, who can be awkward while campaigning, is at ease and funny when the cameras are offâ€” or believed to be.	2	3	1		4
"You're not eating," Romney scolded one attendee during his remarks at the fundraiser.	3	3	1		4
"I'm mesmerized," the donor said.	3	3	1		4
"He's bored to tears," Romney said to laughter.	3	2	1		4
At one point, Romney decided to give the donor a lesson in eating.	3	2	1		4
"You take this, your fork, and you put it in," Romney said.	3	3	1		4
When asked about Democrats' criticisms of his tenure as a wealthy executive at Bain Capital, Romney pretended to plead poverty.	3	2	2		4
"I'm poor as a church mouse," said Romney, who has an estimated fortune of $250 million.	3	2	2		4
NOT UP FOR 'SLAPSTICK'	1	2	1		4
Romney also gossiped about CBS late-night talk show host David Letterman, a frequent critic of the Republican.	2	2	2		4
Romney said he preferred Jay Leno, host of NBC's "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno."	3	2	1		4
"Letterman hates me because I've been on Leno more than him.	3	2	2		4
They are very jealous of each other, you know," Romney said.					4
By coincidence, a few hours after the video's release online, Obama arrived in New York City to tape an interview with Letterman.	2	2	1		4
Romney said he turned down an appearance on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" because visiting the show "has the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential."	3	2	2		4
Days before the election in 2008, Republican presidential candidate John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, flew to New York to be on the show.	2	1	1		4
'ISLAMICS DO NOT WANT TO VOTE FOR YOU'	2	1	2		4
At the Florida fundraiser, Romney's comments were captured by a videocamera that had been placed on what appeared to be a marble bar.	2	1	1		4
Waiters wearing white gloves were seen serving the guests red wine from decanters.	1	1	1		4
For most of the video, only the backs of donors' heads can be seen, with Romney in profile.	2	1	1		4
The audio does, however, pick up donors' comments to Romney, including some good-natured ribbing about his image on the campaign trail.	2	2	1		4
"They say, 'He's a rich boy,'" one donor affably told Romney during the dinner.	3	3	1		4
The comments reflected donors' anxieties about Romney's perceived deficiencies.	3	2	1		4
One donor complained of the difficulties of converting Obama supporters to Romney's side.	2	1	2		4
"Right now I'm very concerned," she said.	3	1	3		4
"Women do not want to vote for you.	3	1	3		4
Islamics, the majority, do not want to vote for you.	3	1	3		4
College students don't."	3	1	3		4
"Why don't you stick up for yourself?" a male donor asked Romney.	3	2	2		4
"You have to show your face more on TV," said another.	3	2	2		4
A third donor counselled Romney on the importance of social media.	3	2	2		4
A fourth donor urged Romney to "take the gloves off and talk to the people who actually read the paper."	3	2	2		4
When Romney responded to their reservations by telling the guests about the importance of his three debates against Obama in October, a donor cut him off.	3	2	1		4
"You will do so well," the donor said.	3	3	1		4
"Your debates are incredible."	3	3	1		4
