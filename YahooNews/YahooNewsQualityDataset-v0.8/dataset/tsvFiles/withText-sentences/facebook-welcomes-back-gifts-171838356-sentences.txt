You'll know if you have the ability to send a gift by looking for the "gifts" tab -- a little present box with a red bow alongside photo and post tags, or next to the person's name if it's their birthday.	2	1	1		4
Then you choose a gift, and opt to pay now or later.	2	1	1		4
You can keep your gifting private or share the news on your Timeline.	2	1	1		4
You can also send a card along with the gift.	2	1	1		4
Your Facebook friend will be notified about the gift just as they would be if you wrote them a message -- via their phone, email or Facebook page.	2	1	1		4

The receiver confirms the gift and confirms their address of where the gift will ship.	1	1	1		4
