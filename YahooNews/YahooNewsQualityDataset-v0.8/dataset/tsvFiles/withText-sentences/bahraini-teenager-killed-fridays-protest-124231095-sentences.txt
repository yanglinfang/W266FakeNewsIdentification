DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahraini riot police killed a teenager when they fired shotgun pellets during clashes with protesters following a demonstration on Friday, the country's opposition said on Saturday, the second young protester to die in six weeks.	1	1	4		4
Thousands rallied on Friday in an officially authorized protest called by the main opposition group al-Wefaq, but as the event ended around 100 demonstrators clashed with police.	1	1	3		4
Witnesses on Friday said riot police used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse those demonstrators, who, the authorities said, were throwing petrol bombs and wielding iron bars.	1	1	3		4
The police described the incident after the protest as a "terrorist attack" on a security patrol that "targeted the lives of members of the patrol" late on Friday evening.	2	1	3		4
The police had defended themselves "according to their legal authority", a statement said, confirming one of the protesters had died.	2	1	3		4
Bahrain, headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, has been in turmoil since mass demonstrations started at the height of Arab Spring unrest last year, led by its Shi'ite Muslim minority.	1	1	2		4
The protests were put down by the Sunni monarchy which imposed martial law and invited Saudi Arabia to send troops in support.	1	1	2		4
In mid-August a 16-year-old protester was killed in a similar incident, when police opened fire with birdshot during clashes after a demonstration, opposition activists said.	2	1	4		4
The opposition says more than 45 people have been killed in protests since martial law was lifted in June 2011.	1	1	4		4
The Interior Ministry says protesters have injured more than 700 police officers and that the authorities have exercised restraint.	2	1	3		4
Al-Wefaq named the dead protester as 17-year-old Ali Hussain Nima and distributed photographs show a body covered in blood and flecked with birdshot wounds.	1	1	4		4
The pictures could not be independently verified.	1	1	1		4
Bahrain and Saudi Arabia accuse Iran of fomenting the unrest in the island kingdom and among Saudi Arabia's Shi'ite Muslim minority, who mostly live in a province situated next to Bahrain.	3	1	2		4
Iran denies the accusations.	1	1	2		4
The death comes a day after the U.N. Human Rights Council appointed a Bahraini as the Asia representative to its advisory committee.	1	1	2		4
