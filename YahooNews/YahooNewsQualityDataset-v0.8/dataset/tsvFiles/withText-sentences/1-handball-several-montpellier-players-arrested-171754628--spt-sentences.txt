Montpellier will become plaintive in the case to "defend (their) honour", according to Levy, a move that would allow them privileged access to the case files.	1	1	1		4
"I cannot confirm nor deny because I'm a plaintive in the case", Levy told Reuters on Sunday.	2	1	1		4
Montpellier, the 2003 European champions, have been the French champions every year since 2008.	1	1	1		4
