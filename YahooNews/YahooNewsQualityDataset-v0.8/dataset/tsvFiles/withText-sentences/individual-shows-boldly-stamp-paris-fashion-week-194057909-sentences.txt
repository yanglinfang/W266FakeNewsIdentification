Individual shows boldly stamp Paris fashion week	3	2	1		3
PARIS (AP) — Coco Chanel once said: "The most courageous act is still to think for yourself."	1	2	1		3
Day five of Paris Fashion Week did not lose sight of the legendary fashion designer's words.	2	2	1		3
Saturday presented a gold mine of eclectic and individual shows, each with a unique stamp of their designer.	3	3	1		3
London-based Vivienne Westwood led the crowd, celebrating Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee, but travelling — as she did — via Japan, Russia, Spain and Africa.	1	2	1		3
Westwood is the only designer on the Paris fashion calendar — or perhaps anywhere — who can cross the globe and several centuries, mixing up Bangkok-style catwomen, Chinese tea prints, tropical cowboys, Velasquez peasants, the Ballets Russes, and still produce a coherent and unified show.	3	3	1		3
Viktor & Rolf, meanwhile, went back to their signature plays on oversized proportion to produce a glitzy show — as they prepare to celebrate 20 years since they founded the label.	3	3	1		3
The epitome of femininity, Cacharel, explored spring through the natural colors of mother nature, in a trademark delicate display.	3	2	1		3
Sunday's shows include Kenzo, Celine and Hermes.	1	1	1		3

VIVIENNE WESTWOOD				I	3
"Global exotic," is how English designer Vivienne Westwood described her brilliant and wacky spring-summer 2013 show, hosted on terra mater in Paris' British Embassy.	5	3	1		3
Disparate encyclopedia fashion references amazingly gelled together, owing to her unique eccentricity.	5	3	1		3
Westwood cited Sergei Diaghilev's "Ballets Russes" — the early 20th century's most famous ballet company — as a key inspiration.	1	2	1		3
The influential troupe used exotic styles with billowing trousers and turbans — which was evoked in many of the baggy globe-trotting looks.	3	3	1		3
One of the nicest looks came in a series of modified Japanese kimonos.	2	2	1		3
One in light gray silk, with wide bateau collar, had fluttering hoop panels that fluttered by.	1	1	1		3
Above all else, Westwood — who's 71 — has lost none of her humor.	3	2	1		3
There was a special guest star — a model portraying Queen Elizabeth II.	3	2	1		3
She clutched a handbag in a crown and demure gray silk dress.	3	2	1		3
In this cameo, unlike in the Olympic Games opening ceremony in which a queen look-a-like parachuted into the main stadium, the model just walked in through the embassy door.	3	3	1		3

VIKTOR & ROLF				I	3
Viktor & Rolf were feeling reflective, looking back on almost two decades since founding their fashion house, and that was evident Saturday in their oversized spring-summer ode to 70s pleated glamor.	2	2	1		3
"We were in a reflective mood..." said Viktor Horsting, one half of the famed Dutch design duo which is approaching its 20th anniversary.	1	2	1		3
Not ones to normally take things quite so literally, the inseparable Viktor and Rolf channeled mirrors in their oversized spring-summer ode to 70's pleated glamor.	2	2	1		3
The designers, who founded their Amsterdam-based fashion house in 1993, sent models through a reflective tunnel onto a catwalk wearing mainly black, white and silver ensembles that featured blinding mirror appliques on sumptuous silks.	1	2	1		3
Oversized proportion — a signature mark — produced some hits.	2	2	1		3
Giant bows in soft pink and purple were used high or low on the waist to sumptuous effect.	3	2	1		3
But there were some small misses in proportion, too: One tubular floor-length skirt had rose-shaped mirror appliques whose size competed with the model's head.	4	1	2		3

CACHAREL				I	3
Cacharel perfectly captured the fresh mood of spring, in a feminine collection — typical of the popular French house — that brought aquatic life to the catwalk.	4	3	1		3
Free hanging A-line slip dress and gently flaring peplums and skirts Saturday, floated alongside prints of goldfish skin, anemones and underwater tea flower bloom.	4	4	1		3
This spring-summer 2013 collection was also a celebration of the natural world in its careful palette the Cerulean blue of sky, orange of sea coral and tea green.	3	3	1		3
But perhaps nature is in the house DNA: After all, designer Jean Bousquet who founded the house in 1962, named it after a small, beautifully striped dabbling duck with the same name.	4	2	1		3
Today's designers Ling Liu and Dawei Sun keep these codes, therefore, adding this season a touch of contemporary graphic prints.	2	2	1		3
The gentle blurring made this collection a visual treat.	4	2	1		3

MARTIN GRANT				I	3
Australian Martin Grant is not a household name, but he has a solid reputation in the fashion world and a string of celebrity followers like Juliette Binoche, Kate Hudson and Cate Blanchett.	3	2	1		3
Saturday's clean and on-trend collection proves it's little wonder.	3	2	1		3
"I wanted to play with volumes," Grant said backstage, referring to the many looks which had elongated peplums and jacket-skirts, twinned with black shorts — seen in Raf Simons' show for Dior.	2	2	1		3
Black and navy was used well in A-line with trapeze silhouettes, and accentuated midriff — one of the big parts of this season's fashion conversation — nicely nipped the silhouettes.	4	3	1		3
One of the colors of the season, vermilion, was used perfectly as shards of color, or completely covering dresses.	4	3	1		3
