Nasdaq defends Facebook compensation plan in letter to SEC	1	1	1		4
(Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group Inc stood by its proposed $62 million plan to compensate firms affected by the fallout from Facebook's botched IPO, taking aim at UBS AG, Citigroup Inc and other parties which derided the payback plan.	1	1	1	 	4
In a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated September 17, Nasdaq said the proposed compensation pool "goes well beyond what is required under current Nasdaq rules."	2	2	1		4
It noted that if the proposal is not approved, the applicable limit of liability under the approved rule would instead be $500,000 - less than 1 percent of the proposed pool.	1	1	1		4
Nasdaq's plan to offer $62 million in cash was an increase from an earlier $40 million payback fund, which was made up mostly of trading rebates.	1	1	1		4
Nasdaq defended its use of a 45-minute window to determine a benchmark reference price to assess the amount owed on orders qualifying for accommodation.	2	1	1		4
The company said the time frame "should have been ample time for a reasonably diligent member to identify any unexpected losses or unanticipated positions and take steps to mitigate or liquidate them."	2	1	2		4
The eight-page letter was signed by Nasdaq Senior Vice President and Corporate Secretary Joan Conley.	1	1	1		4
