Film critics have begun to judge Dredd 3D, a new take on the popular comic book character (view trailer below) that hits theaters today — and the verdict is surprisingly positive, given the scathing reviews and relatively meager box office elicited by 1995's Judge Dredd, starring Sylvester Stallone.	3	2	1		4

Stallone's Judge Dredd was bad — but it's still better than Dredd 3D: "Say what you will about Sylvester Stallone's kitschy" performance in 1995's Judge Dredd, says Roger Moore at the Detroit Free Press, at least Stallone "wore the helmet" — in Dredd 3D, "the helmet wears Karl."	2	2	2		4

Dredd 3D is "a far grittier and more capable rendering" of the character than "the really disastrous Sylvester Stallone-starring mangling of the comic" — but its collection of "post-modern sci-fi cliches" feels dated after the 17 years of science-fiction that has been released in Judge Dredd's wake.	2	2	2		4
