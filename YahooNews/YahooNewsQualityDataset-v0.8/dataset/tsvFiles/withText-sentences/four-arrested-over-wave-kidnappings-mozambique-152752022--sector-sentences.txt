MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique police have arrested four men accused of running a kidnapping ring behind more than 20 abductions in the capital Maputo in the past year.	1	1	2		4
The alleged ring-leader, Bakhir Ayoob, is the son-in-law of Mohamed Bachir Suleman, a wealthy businessman in the city.	2	1	1		4
Washington has branded Suleman a drug kingpin and in 2010 banned U.S. companies from having any financial dealings with him.	2	1	2		4
Wealthy Muslims have been the main targets of the kidnappings, which began in November.	1	1	2		4
All those abducted were released after ransoms were paid.	1	1	2		4
When a 17 year-old girl was kidnapped last month, Muslims in the city threatened to strike in protest at what they said was a lack of government action.	1	1	2		4
Police detained Ayoob, 30, at his home early on Friday.	1	1	2		4
He is the highest-profile suspect of 20 men arrested in connection with the kidnappings.	1	1	2		4
The abductions are part of a wider crime wave targeting wealthy foreigners who have moved into Maputo on the back of a flood investment into the southern African nation's vast coal and natural gas reserves.	1	1	3		4
