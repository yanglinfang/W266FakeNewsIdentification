Death penalty recommended for California man who set deadly wildfire	1	1	4		4
(Reuters) - A California jury on Friday recommended a death sentence for a man found guilty of starting a 2003 wildfire that burned nearly 100,000 acres, damaged more than 1,000 homes and led to the deaths of five people, prosecutors said.	1	1	4		4
Rickie Lee Fowler, 31, had already been convicted of arson and five counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of people prosecutors said lived in the fire's path and died from heart attacks caused by the stress of evacuation and threats to their homes.	1	1	5		4
"We take capital punishment seriously.	3	1	2		4
We don't seek capital punishment on every murder," San Bernardino District Attorney Michael Ramos said.	2	2	2		4
"It's for those people who are most horrendous murderers, rapists - people like Rickie Fowler."	4	1	5		4
The death sentence recommendation, on which the judge will make a final ruling at a later hearing, comes just over a month before California voters will decide on a November ballot measure whether to repeal the death penalty in a state that is home to nearly a quarter of the nation's death-row inmates.	1	1	2		4
The October 2003 blaze that Fowler was convicted of starting, called the Old Fire, burned in the San Bernardino Mountains of Southern California, eventually scorching 91,281 acres.	1	1	3		4
A 2009 grand jury indictment in the case determined that Fowler, while not the actual killer of the five people, started the fire with "reckless indifference to human life."	2	2	3		4
Prosecutors note that individuals who commit a serious violent felony - like robbery, kidnapping, or arson - that results in death are eligible for capital punishment.	1	1	4		4
Jurors deliberated for 11 days during the trial's penalty phase before returning a death sentence recommendation, prosecutors said.	1	1	3		4
While the death penalty remains on the books in California, the state has executed just 13 people since reinstating capital punishment in 1978.	1	2	3		4
More than 720 inmates sit on death row in California, pending long, expensive appeals.	2	1	3		4
A federal judge halted all California executions in 2006 after ruling that a three-drug protocol used for lethal injections carried the risk of causing inmates too much pain and suffering before death.	1	2	4		4
California has since revised its protocol, but an appeals court has blocked a resumption of executions.	1	2	2		4
Fowler had already been sentenced under California's three-strikes law to 75 years to life in prison for committing sodomy against another inmate while behind bars, prosecutors said.	1	1	4		4
They added that he had prior convictions for rape and drug offenses.	1	1	4		4
Fowler's defense attorney did not respond to requests for comment.	1	1	1		4
