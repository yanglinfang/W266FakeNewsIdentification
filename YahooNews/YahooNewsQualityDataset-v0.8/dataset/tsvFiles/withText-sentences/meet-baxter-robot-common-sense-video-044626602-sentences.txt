Meet Baxter: A Robot With Common Sense [VIDEO]	2	1	1		4
Baxter is like most reliable employees -- he uses common sense to do his job, and works well with others -- except, he's a robot.	3	2	1		4
To be precise, Baxter robots are a new line of androids that can apply common sense behavior in manufacturing workplaces.	2	1	1		4
Developed by Boston-based Rethink Robotics, Baxter automatically adapts to changing environments through cameras, sensors and software that enable it to "'see' objects, 'feel' forces and 'understand' tasks," according to the company's website.	1	1	1		4
For this reason, Rethink claims that Baxter robots can safely work alongside humans.	2	1	1		4
They can also be trained like a person, with the robots capable of juggling multiple tasks, and learning a new one in less than 30 minutes (Check out the video above to see them in action).	1	1	1		4
Priced at $22,000 and with no integration required, Baxter robots are "a fraction of the cost of a traditional industrial robot," according to Rethink.	2	1	1		4
"Baxter was specifically designed to be affordable for mid-size and small manufacturers, companies that have never been able to afford robots before."	2	1	1		4
"We [can] offer new hope to the millions of American manufacturers who are looking for innovative ways to compete in our global economy."	3	2	1		4
The androids are ready to start work in less than one hour after they hit the factory floor, the company adds.	2	1	1		4
Baxter is a complete, self-contained system with application software that can be updated.	1	1	1		4
Rethink says it plans to offer a software development kit in early 2013 for those who want to make use of the technology.	1	1	1		4
Unveiled Tuesday, the robots are available on pre-order; first product shipments will begin this October.	1	1	1		4
