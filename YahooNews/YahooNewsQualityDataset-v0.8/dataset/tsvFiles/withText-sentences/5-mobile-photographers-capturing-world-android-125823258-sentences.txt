"Shooting with my Droid is my favorite thing to do with my clothes on," Stokes says.	3	3	1		4
She finds her Android device, with its camera and sharing capabilities, to be a perfect immediate art form.	1	2	1		4
"The more pictures I took, the more I saw what could be achieved, and the more I liked it," she says.	2	3	1		4
Stokes enjoys shooting nature -- waterscapes, flowers, sunrises and sunsets -- as well as anything she sees during the day with an interesting light or unusual aspect.	2	2	1		4
"My Android device inspires me with its versatility ... and absolutely beautiful color and results," she says.	3	3	1		4
Stokes mentions that mobile photographers should make shooting with their phones a habit, or a ritual -- that way, it will "quickly, almost automatically, become one of your favorite art forms."	2	2	1		4
"I use my Android because it fits in my pocket or purse in a way a DSLR just doesn't," she says.	2	1	1		4
"Not having a million settings forces me to think about the photo in a different way."	2	1	1		4
Cowden advises mobile photographers to make sure the lens is always clean, and to always be on the lookout for natural light.	2	1	1		4
"Since the camera phone is not very adjustable, I try to start out with good lighting so I can focus on framing and composition," she says.	2	1	1		4
For Tidmore, the benefit of using an Android device extends past its convenient size -- he likes that everything is maintained on one device.	2	2	1		4
"It's being able to do all of my editing, and upload [photos] to a social network, all on my phone no matter where I am," he says.	2	1	1		4
"I have a job where I'm out and about all day, and being able to create on my phone while I should be working is awesome."	2	3	1		4
His main piece of advice for mobile photographers?	2	1	1		4
Experiment with apps.	2	1	1		4
"There is no shortage of photography apps in the App Store or Google Play.	2	1	1		4
Spend a lot of time working with different ones until you find your 'style' or something that really clicks with you," he advises.	2	1	1		4
"Other than that, shoot often ... and have fun!"	3	2	1		4
Hamelin uses editing apps like UCam Ultra Camera (which allows him to focus easier) and Pixlr-o-matic for filters.	1	1	1		4
The HTC Desire also includes camera software that creates panoramic photos.	1	1	1		4
"I always try to have pictures that tell stories or at least that give a feeling," Hamelin says.	3	1	1		4
"All my pictures taken with my smartphone are made to be seen by my friends that live far away from me [in Belgium], so I try to put what I feel inside."	3	1	1		4
Hamelin suggests that fellow mobile photographers "look everywhere, shoot, move, shoot again -- the more you take pictures, the more you find what works and what does not."	3	1	1		4
"Convenience is the biggest factor," Mistry says.	3	2	1		4
"I have my phone on me all the time, and it has a pretty good camera attached to it.	3	2	1		4
I do usually carry my DSLR around with me, too, but sometimes it's just quicker to get that snapshot with my phone."	2	1	1		4
She explains that being able to share her photos instantly is another reason why her smartphone's camera comes in handy.	2	2	1		4
Mistry is an advocate for editing photos, but she advises mobile photographers to be smart about it.	2	1	1		4
"I know there's a lot of backlash against filters on your photos, and I can understand [that] backlash," she says.	2	1	2		4
"Which is why I say use filters, but don't abuse filters.	2	1	1		4
Don't feel the need to add a filter if your photo doesn't need it.	2	1	1		4
Sometimes a photo is perfectly brilliant without a filter over the top of it."	2	2	1		4
