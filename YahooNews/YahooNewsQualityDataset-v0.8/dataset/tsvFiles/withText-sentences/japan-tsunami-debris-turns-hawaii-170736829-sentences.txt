Japan Tsunami Debris Turns Up in Hawaii	1	1	3		4
A barnacle-covered seafood storage bin has been identified as the first piece of debris to arrive in Hawaii from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.	1	1	2		4
The blue cubed bin, about 4 feet (1.2 meters) on each side, was spotted floating off the coast of Waimanalo, Oahu, last week and was towed ashore by marine officials, according to a statement from Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR).	2	1	2		4
Officials said the plastic container belongs to Japanese seafood company Y.K. Suisan, Co., Ltd., based in the Miyagi prefecture, a region hit hard by the earthquake-triggered tsunami.	2	1	3		4
As the disaster also set off a nuclear crisis with a partial meltdown at Japan's Fukushima power plant, health officials tested the bin for radiation but did not find any abnormal levels.	2	1	3		4
The bin was housing gooseneck barnacles and crabs that typically live on floating debris in the open ocean.	1	2	2		4
Officials said the organisms are not invasive to Hawaii.	2	2	1		4
A few dead birds also were found inside the container.	1	1	2		4
The Japanese government has estimated that the tsunami swept about 5 million tons of wreckage out to sea.	2	1	4		4
Seventy percent of this debris is believed to have sunk offshore, but no one knows how much of the remaining 1.5 million tons are still floating in the Pacific Ocean.	2	1	3		4
A handful of these lost parts have already turned up on or near the west coast of North America, from a small boat that washed up on a remote island in British Columbia to a large Japanese fishing ship that officials had to sink off the coast of Alaska.	1	1	2		4
