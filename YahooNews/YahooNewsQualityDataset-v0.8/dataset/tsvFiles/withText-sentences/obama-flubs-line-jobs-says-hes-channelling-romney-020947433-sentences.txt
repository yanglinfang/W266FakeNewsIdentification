KENT, Ohio (Reuters) - President Barack Obama flubbed a line during a campaign speech on Wednesday, mistakenly saying he wanted to export U.S. jobs, before correcting himself and jokingly blaming Republican rival Mitt Romney.	2	1	2		4
In the middle of remarks to an enthusiastic crowd in the battleground state of Ohio, Obama was describing a five-point plan to boost employment and lay a "stronger foundation" for the U.S. economy when he stumbled at a crucial word.	2	2	2		4
"I want to see us export more jobs," Obama said, before catching himself quickly and saying, "Export more products."	2	1	1		4
"Excuse me," he exclaimed, drawing laughter.	2	1	1		4
"I was channelling my opponent there for a second."	2	1	1		4
Obama frequently derides Romney, a former private equity executive, for being a "pioneer" of outsourcing jobs to other countries.	3	1	1		4
With unemployment levels above 8 percent, both men are trying to convince voters they have the better plan to create jobs and boost the economy at home.	2	2	2		4
