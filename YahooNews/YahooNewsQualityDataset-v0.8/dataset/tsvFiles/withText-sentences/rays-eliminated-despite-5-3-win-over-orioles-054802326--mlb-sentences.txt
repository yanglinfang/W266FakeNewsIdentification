Rays eliminated despite 5-3 win over Orioles	3	1	2		2
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Joe Maddon planned to sleep well, regardless of whether the Tampa Bay Rays got the help they need to keep their playoff hopes alive.	3	2	2		2
"I'll find out tomorrow morning," said Maddon, who then was asked if he expected to sleep well.	3	2	1		2
"Absolutely.	3	3	1		2
Like a baby."	3	3	1		2
Bad news awaited the manager when he woke up Tuesday — his team was eliminated from postseason contention.	3	1	3		2
The Rays won for the 11th time in 12 games, beating Baltimore 5-3 on Monday night.	3	3	1		2
That stretch kept them in contention for the AL's second wild-card until Oakland beat Texas 4-3 later Monday night.	3	2	2		2
Baltimore already is assured of being in the playoffs for the first time in 15 years, but still has its sights on outlasting the Yankees for the AL East title.	1	3	1		2
The Orioles fell a game out of first place behind New York when the Yankees beat Boston.	1	2	2		2
"We've played 12 playoff games and we've won 11 of them," said Maddon, whose team has outscored opponents 80-31 during the surge.	4	3	1		2
" But we do need help, there's no question about that.	3	1	2		2
Again, regardless, I just love the way our guys are going about their business."	3	2	1		2
Alex Cobb allowed two hits over seven innings, Ben Zobrist hit his 20th homer and Chris Giminez had a two-run double off Wei-Yin Chen as the Rays pulled away from a 1-1 tie in the seventh.	2	2	1		2
Cobb (11-9) yielded a fourth-inning single to J.J. Hardy and an opposite-field solo homer to Matt Wieters that had tied it in the top of the seventh.	2	3	1		2
Chris Davis homered for the fifth straight game for Baltimore, a two-run shot off Kyle Farnsworth that trimmed Baltimore's deficit to 5-3 in the ninth.	2	3	2		2
Fernando Rodney gave up singles to Adam Jones and Wieters to put the potential tying runs on base.	2	2	1		2
The Rays closer struck out Jim Thome and Mark Reynolds before getting Endy Chavez to hit a grounder back to mound to end the game.	2	2	1		2
It was Rodney's 47th save in 49 opportunities.	2	2	1		2
"We didn't take care of our business.	4	1	3		2
We lost," Jones said.	4	1	3		2
"When it comes to the Yankees, we can't control them.	4	1	3		2
We can't control if they win or lose."	4	1	3		2
The Orioles arrived in St. Petersburg for the season-ending series later than expected Sunday night after their plane had to divert to Jacksonville because of a fire in the galley.	2	1	2		2
They officially clinched at least a wild-card berth when the Los Angeles Angels lost the second game of a doubleheader to the Texas Rangers late Sunday, and manager Buck Showalter, coaches and players celebrated by having a short meeting and toasting the accomplishment at the team hotel.	2	2	2		2
"We've clinched a spot, but we've got an opportunity to win the East.	3	3	1		2
That's big," Jones said before the game.	3	2	1		2
"You get to put up a banner at Camden Yards.	3	2	1		2
It speaks something about the team.	1	1	1		2
It means you finished ahead of the Yankees and Boston and Tampa Bay, everybody."	3	3	1		2
Cobb retired 10 in a row before Hardy singled between shortstop and third base for Baltimore's first hit.	2	2	2		2
The 24-year-old right-hander walked Jim Thome with one out in the fifth and Nate McLouth with one out in the sixth.	3	3	1		2
McLouth stole second, but was stranded when J.J. Hardy grounded to shortstop and Chris Davis took a third called strike.	3	2	3		2
Wieters' career-high 23rd homer home run cleared the short wall in the left-field corner known as 162 Landing, the spot where Evan Longoria hit the 12th-inning homer that the sent the Rays to the playoffs on the final night of last season.	3	3	1		2
"It is frustrating when it's out of your hands, but we put ourselves in that position.	3	1	3		2
We could have held our own destiny," Cobb said.	3	1	3		2
"Even coming into the last road trip we had that chance, but we let a couple slip that we wish we could have had back, but we're doing all we can now with what we have."	3	1	3		2
While Maddon is hoping for another dramatic finish, the manager said he won't fret if the Rays fall short of earning their fourth berth in five seasons.	3	1	3		2
"Honestly, it just is what it is.	2	1	1		2
We had opportunities early in the year to win more games, and we did not.	3	1	2		2
But so did everybody else," Maddon said.	3	1	1		2
"Everybody else is going to be bemoaning the same points if they don't get there at this juncture.	3	1	3		2
So for me, it's about staying right here, keeping the blinders on.	3	2	1		2
It's about moving it forward, organizationally speaking.	3	3	1		2
We've stil got a heartbeat.	3	2	1		2
Let's see what happens.	3	2	1		2
I expect to come out (Tuesday) with another game that means something."	3	2	1		2
NOTES: Chen, who's 0-4 over seven starts since last winning on Aug. 19, hasn't won since Aug. 19, allowed four runs — three of them unearned — and six hits in 6 2-3 innings.	3	1	3		2
... Zobrist joined B.J. Upton as the only Rays with at least 20 homers.	2	2	2		2
He has driven in 21 runs in 28 games since the start of September.	2	2	1		2
