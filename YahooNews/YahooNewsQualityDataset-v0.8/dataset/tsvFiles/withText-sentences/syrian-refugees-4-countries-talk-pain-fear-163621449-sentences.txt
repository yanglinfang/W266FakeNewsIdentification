TRIPOLI, Lebanon — Hasna Um Abdou lost her children, her husband and both legs to a mortar.	1	1	5		4
Now the veiled 38-year-old woman lies in a hospital bed in this northern Lebanese city, with the Quran, the Muslim holy book, on her table.	2	1	3		4
She talks slowly, with pauses, and is visibly trying to hold back the tears.	2	1	4		4
Abdul-Aziz, 3, and Talin, 13 months, were her only children.	1	1	3		4
"Every time I remember, I feel the pain," she says.	3	1	5		4
Um Abdou is one of thousands of Syrians who have been wounded in the uprising against Assad and its aftermath.	1	1	4		4
Hundreds of the wounded have been taken for treatment in neighboring countries, mostly to Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.	1	2	2		4
More than 74,000 Syrians have taken refuge in Lebanon, itself a small country of just 4 million people that is struggling with instability.	1	2	2		4
Um Abdou and her family fled their village in Homs province in March amid intense shelling, to a second village and then a third.	2	1	3		4
Two days later, it seemed quiet, and they decided to return home.	2	2	1		4
The family rode back on March 31 on a motorcycle, with Um Abdou's daughter asleep in her arms and her son sitting in front of his father.	2	2	1		4
Then her world fell apart.	2	1	5		4
Um Abdou keeps hearing the sound not of the mortar, but of the terror.	3	1	5		4
"I cannot forget the noise of the hearts beating quickly as people gathered around us," she says.	3	1	4		4
Her daughter died immediately from a shrapnel wound in the head.	2	1	5		4
Her son bled profusely and died minutes later, even as she looked at him.	2	1	5		4
She did not want her husband to know the children were dead, so she said nothing and started to pray.	2	2	4		4
But her husband was severely injured too -- the shrapnel had blown out his intestines.	1	1	4		4
And Um Abdou looked down to find her own legs hanging slightly from her body.	1	1	5		4
"The moment I saw myself, I knew that my legs were going to be amputated," she says.	2	1	5		4
She and her husband were rushed to makeshift hospitals in the Syrian border towns of Qusair and Jousi.	1	2	3		4
With the help of Syrian rebels, she was carried on a stretcher all the way across the border to Lebanon, amid 12 hours of shelling and shooting.	2	3	3		4
Her husband died en route.	1	1	4		4
Um Abdou's children are now buried in a plot of land in Syria owned by the state.	1	1	3		4
Her husband was buried in the cemetery in Jousi because it was too dangerous to take him back to his hometown.	1	1	4		4
"Even the dead have no right to be buried," she says.	3	1	4		4
Um Abdou has undergone four operations in Lebanon, including the two amputations.	1	1	4		4
Her parents and sisters are looking after her, and she displays the green, red, white and black flag of the Syrian revolution in her room.	1	2	4		4
She knows the pain will be unbearable the day she goes back to Syria and visits the place where her family is buried.	2	1	5		4
In the meantime, she has written a poem in the hospital.	1	3	2		4
"I lost my children and husband, but my soul is still strong," it reads.	3	3	4		4
"I will keep saying until my last breath, long live freedom."	3	4	1		4

BAGHDAD, Iraq — The gang of masked gunmen broke into the small apartment near Damascus where Waleed Mohammed Abdul-Wahid and his family had lived for nearly three years.	2	1	4		4
"Are you Sunni or Shiite?" they shouted, as his three children began to cry.	2	1	4		4
"We are Sunnis!"	2	1	1		4
answered his wife, Wasan Malouki Khalaf.				S	4
"Do you know any Shiites who are cooperating with the Syrian government?" the gunmen demanded.	3	1	3		4
"We do not know any such people," she said.	2	1	1		4
"We are from Baghdad."	2	1	1		4
The gunmen left.	1	2	2		4
The brief but terrifying invasion sealed the decision Abdul-Wahid had been mulling for weeks: to leave behind an increasingly violent life in Syria and return to Iraq.	2	1	5		4
More than 2, 200,000 people fled Iraq during the war and sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and almost half of them ended up in neighboring Syria.	1	1	4		4
Now Syria is plagued with the same sectarian conflict, and many of the same people are on the run a second time.	1	1	4		4
At least 22,000 Iraqi refugees are thought to have left Syria to return to Iraq, despite the dangers they thought they had left behind.	2	1	4		4
Abdul-Wahid had worked as a deliveryman back in Baghdad, bringing cylinders of cooking gas to both Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods.	1	2	1		4
Militants kidnapped him outside his Sunni-dominated neighborhood of Azimiyah in 2009 and tortured him for four days.	1	1	5		4
His arms still show the burn scars.	1	1	3		4
The family packed up and fled to Syria, where they built a new life in a mostly Shiite suburb.	2	2	3		4
The children settled down in school, and the United Nations gave them food and an income.	1	3	1		4
Abdul-Wahid, 49, found a job in construction and started taking medication for the severe depression he had suffered after the kidnapping.	2	3	4		4
Then the uprising against Assad began, and violence returned to Abdul-Wahid's life.	2	1	4		4
Mortars bombarded their neighborhood, and snipers shot at people in the streets.	2	1	5		4
The last straw was the gunmen storming their home in late July, and asking his daughter if she was Sunni or Shiite.	2	1	3		4
"She did not reply, because she does not know the meaning of such a question," Abdul-Wahid says.	2	1	3		4
The bus fare from Damascus to Baghdad cost about $110 for each person.	1	1	3		4
Abdul-Wahid had to ask his brother for money, he says, his eyes filling up with tears of sadness and shame.	3	1	4		4
His family is living in a room in his brother's house.	1	2	2		4
"I have lost everything now," he says.	3	1	4		4
"I am jobless and penniless...I am even afraid of going outside my brother's house.	3	1	4		4
Now, I have to start from zero."	3	1	4		4
He plans to go back to Syria when — or if — the violence ebbs.	2	2	3		4
Wasan, his wife, says the shortages of electricity and water in Iraq are unbearable, as is the lack of good medical care, security and jobs.	3	1	4		4
But Abdul-Wahid is doubtful the violence will end any time soon, or Assad will be ousted from power.	3	1	3		4
"I think that the armed struggle in Syria will continue for a long time," he says.	3	1	4		4
"He is clinging to power...I think that he will survive."	3	1	4		4

ZAATARI, Jordan — At this Syrian refugee camp opened in the desert just two months ago, anger sizzles in the scorching sun.	2	1	3		4
It is anger at being crowded with about 32,000 other people onto a parched, treeless strip of land, where the day is too hot and the night is too cold.	3	1	3		4
But it is also a murderous anger among the Sunni Muslims here against the Shiites back home, whom they blame for the war.	3	1	4		4
Many Sunnis oppose Assad's ruling regime, which is Alawite, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.	2	1	3		4
"When I return, I will kill any Shiite I see with my dagger.	4	1	5		4
I will chop him to pieces," shouts Basel Baradan, a bitter 18-year-old farmer who fled the southern town of Daraa with his family in July.	4	1	5		4
He is weeping.	4	1	4		4
Jordan now hosts an estimated 200,000 Syrians, including those not registered with the U.N. -- the largest number of refugees taken in by any neighboring country.	2	2	4		4
After months of delay, Jordan finally opened its first official refugee camp in July at Zaatari, near the border with Syria.	1	2	3		4
Already, about 30,000 refugees live at the camp, and they keep coming.	1	2	3		4
This poor desert nation says it can no longer afford to welcome Syrian refugees into its towns and houses.	2	1	3		4
So they live apart at Zaatari, and they grow angrier.	3	1	3		4
Late Monday, dozens of furious refugees hurled stones and injured about 26 Jordanian policemen, demanding better camp conditions or their return home.	3	1	4		4
Baradan's father Ghassan, 50, also a farmer, says that with the ubiquitous dust, snakes, scorpions and swings in temperature, living at Zaatari is a "worse struggle than Assad's missiles falling on our heads back home."	4	1	4		4
He too is angry, and blames Shiites under Assad for killing Sunnis.	4	1	4		4
Baradan lived most of his life exchanging visits and sharing meals with Shiite neighbors.	2	2	1		4
But he grew increasingly resentful in recent years because he thought the Shiites were getting more food and money, and were supported by Iran, a Shiite Muslim nation.	3	1	3		4
"Sunni Muslims have no respect in Syria and we fled here to find ourselves confined to this dirty prison," he sighs, puffing on his cigarette under a once-white tent, yellowed from the desert sun and heat.	4	1	4		4
The thirst for revenge that is palpable at the Zaatari camp does not bode well for Syria's future.	4	1	4		4
Baradan's tent is marked with the Arabic scribbling "Get out, Assad."	3	2	3		4
Outside, a group of young Syrians lines up to fill buckets with drinking water.	1	2	1		4
One of them, Mohammad Sweidan, 17, wears a green T-shirt with an Arabic emblem that reads: "Proud Sunni."	3	2	1		4
"Shiites and Alawites are not Muslims," he says.	3	1	2		4
"They should be killed because they are infidels, who are killing the Sunnis, the true believers and followers of Islam."	5	2	5		4
Under Baradan's tent, his 46-year-old wife says she worries about ending up stateless, like Palestinian refugees displaced in wars with Israel.	3	1	3		4
She cries as she cooks lunch on a small gas stove.	4	1	4		4
"I never thought we would become refugees like them," says the woman, who calls herself Um Basel after her eldest son, in keeping with conservative Muslim tradition.	3	1	4		4
Her husband interrupts.	1	1	1		4
"Even the Israelis do not treat the Palestinians the way Assad is treating Sunnis in Syria."	3	1	4		4
In a corner, Basel too is crying as he gazes at video on his cellphone of his 9-month-old nephew, Rabee, left behind in Daraa with his family.	3	1	4		4
"What is keeping me going is this video," he says, tearfully.	4	1	5		4
"I can't wait to see Rabee again.	4	2	4		4
I miss him dearly."	4	2	4		4

CAIRO, Egypt — Syrian refugee Mohammad B.'s passport expired a few weeks ago, making official what he has long known: He no longer has a country.	2	1	3		4
The 26-year-old had nowhere to renew his passport.	2	1	3		4
The Syrian embassy in Cairo was closed after protests.	1	1	2		4
The embassies in Libya and Tunisia had switched loyalty to the opposition and could no longer issue passports.	1	1	2		4
And the embassy in Algeria simply told him to go back to Syria.	2	1	3		4
That was not an option.	2	1	3		4
In Syria, Mohammad had been studying to become an English teacher.	1	2	1		4
He fled in May 2011 after he was shot in Daraa, the birthplace of the uprising.	1	1	4		4
The bullet pierced his upper lip, broke his teeth, ripped through his cheekbone and exited near his temple.	1	1	4		4
The deep, jagged wound identified him as an anti-government protester, which in Syria marked him for death.	1	1	5		4
At first all the protesters wanted was a new mayor and better amenities.	2	2	1		4
Mohammad was hopeful.	3	2	1		4
"I didn't want to leave my country, I wanted it to get better," says the soft spoken young man with a ponytail and a right eye that droops slightly from his wound.	3	3	1		4
He uses only his first name because he fears for the safety of his parents, both government employees in Daraa.	3	1	3		4
On April 25, the military clamped off the main road into Daraa.	1	1	2		4
Then, he says, security forces started firing into the crowd of about 50 people with large machine guns.	2	1	5		4
A bullet sliced Mohammad's lip.	2	2	4		4
He waved his hands for help, and a car came to his aid.	2	2	4		4
A cellphone video he was shooting at the time, seen by The Associated Press, records the sound of a hail of bullets popping off the metal.	2	1	3		4
"It was very painful," Mohammad recalls.	4	1	4		4
"I thought: Today is my last day....And the driver thought I was dead."	5	1	5		4
When he got home, his family fled to hide with relatives in the countryside.	1	1	3		4
He stayed in bed for a week, unable to eat.	1	1	3		4
Then he made the most difficult decision of his life: He had to leave Syria immediately.	2	1	4		4
He had never left Syria before.	1	1	1		4
He chose Egypt because he would not need a visa, and knew a friend there.	1	2	1		4
Egypt does not share a border with Syria, and only about 1,700 Syrian refugees have registered there, according to the United Nations' refugee agency.	1	1	1		4
However, the agency estimates the real number is closer to 95,000.	2	1	1		4
Mohammad's family gave him about $1,000 in cash, all they could spare.	1	2	2		4
He put on dark sunglasses, wrapped a headdress over his face and prayed all the way to the airport.	3	1	3		4
The bus passed a gauntlet of 25 checkpoints.	2	1	2		4
At the airport, he was detained for questioning but slipped interrogators a $300 bribe.	2	1	3		4
He headed for his plane, sure he would be back.	2	1	3		4
Instead he is still in Cairo, with no money.	2	1	4		4
He lives in a rundown apartment where eight people share three rooms.	1	1	3		4
With the help of a German-based aid group, Mohammad has had four operations for his face.	1	3	2		4
His doctor says he will need more.	2	1	3		4
In February, one of Mohammad's five brothers made his way to Egypt, via Jordan.	1	1	2		4
Bashar, 21, suffers from psychological problems after being shut in the house for a year watching the violence on TV.	2	1	3		4
His presence both helps and hurts Mohammad.	2	2	2		4
"I feel like I have a family, but on the other hand, it made my life more difficult," Mohammad said.	3	2	2		4
"He doesn't work."	2	1	2		4
Mohammad cannot legally work or study either.	2	1	2		4
But he is teaching Arabic and translating for journalists.	1	2	1		4
He also is considering starting a Web-based service to collect videos, photos and other documentation of the rebellion from citizens back home.	2	2	2		4
He talks with his family in Syria most days by phone or Skype.	2	2	1		4
They never discuss politics.	1	1	2		4
Since he left, security forces have gone to his house twice looking for him.	1	1	2		4
"I am worried all the time about my family and friends," he says.	3	1	3		4
"When I check on them, I just want to know they are still there."	3	1	3		4
Above all, Mohammad longs to go home, study and have a good career.	3	2	3		4
None of that is possible while he is stranded in Egypt with an expired passport.	2	1	3		4
"I just want to stop this bloodbath," he says.	3	1	4		4
"I don't know how."	3	1	3		4
