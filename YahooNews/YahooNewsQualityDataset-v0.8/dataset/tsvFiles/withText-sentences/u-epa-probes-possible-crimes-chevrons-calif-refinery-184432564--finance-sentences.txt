U.S. EPA probes possible crimes at Chevron's Calif. refinery: report	3	1	2		4
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is investigating possible criminal violations by Chevron Corp at its SanFrancisco Bay-area refinery in Richmond, California, according to a report by the San Francisco Chronicle.	1	1	2		4
The investigation is unrelated to state and federal probes of an August 6 explosion and fire that shut the central crude oil refining unit at the 245,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Richmond refinery, according to the Chronicle report.	1	1	2		4
Chevron told the newspaper that it was cooperating with the investigation, which began early this year, prior to the fire.	1	2	2		4
California pollution investigators have also been investigating the use of the 3-inch (7.6-centimeter) pipe, which allowed emissions from a hydrocracking complex to bypass the refinery's pollution control equipment on the way to the refinery's safety flare system, at the discretion of the complex's operator.	1	1	2		4
Chevron told the Chronicle the use of the pipe was inadvertent.	1	1	2		4
A Chevron representative was not immediately available on Sunday to discuss operations at the Richmond refinery.	1	1	2		4
