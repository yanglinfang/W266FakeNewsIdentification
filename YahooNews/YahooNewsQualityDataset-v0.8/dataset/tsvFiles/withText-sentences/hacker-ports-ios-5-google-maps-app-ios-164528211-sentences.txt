Hacker ports iOS 5â€²s Google Maps app to iOS 6 [video]	1	1	1

Ryan Petrich on Sunday posted a video that demonstrates the original Google Maps program from iOS 5 running on iOS 6. Petrich revealed that he would like to release the hack to the public, however it is not yet stable enough to do so.	2	1	1
