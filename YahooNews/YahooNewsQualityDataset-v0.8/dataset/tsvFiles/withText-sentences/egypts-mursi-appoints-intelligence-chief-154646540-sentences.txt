CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt President Mohamed Mursi appointed a new national intelligence chief on Wednesday to replace Mourad Mwafi, who was sent into retirement after an attack that left 16 border guards dead in Sinai last month.	1	1	2		4
Mohamed Shehata, already named as Mwafi's temporary replacement following the August 5 attack, was given the post on a permanent basis, the president said in a statement.	1	1	1		4
The decision to retire Mwafi was seen by many as a major step to entrench Mursi's power after he took office on June 30.	2	1	1		4
Mursi's election win ended more than a year of interim army rule that followed the overthrow of president and former air force commander Hosni Mubarak.	1	1	1		4
He later removed the country's top two generals from their positions.	1	1	1		4
