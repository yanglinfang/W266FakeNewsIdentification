WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Chairman Ben Bernanke offered a sharp defense Monday of the Federal Reserve's bold policies to stimulate the weak economy, while cautioning Congress to respect its private discussions.	2	2	2		4
The Fed needs to drive down borrowing rates low because the economy isn't growing fast enough to reduce high unemployment, Bernanke said in a speech to the Indiana Economics Club.	3	1	2		4
The unemployment rate is 8.1 percent.	1	1	1		4
Low rates could help lower the federal budget deficit by reducing the government's borrowing costs and generating more tax revenue through stronger growth, Bernanke said.	2	2	1		4
Bernanke also cautioned Congress against changing the law so it could review the Fed's interest-rate policy discussions.	2	1	1		4
Such a step would improperly inject political pressure into those talks and make Fed policymakers less likely to act, Bernanke warns.	2	1	2		4
The speech comes just weeks after the Fed voted at its Sept. 12-13 meeting to purchase mortgage bonds to help boost the housing market.	1	2	1		4
The Fed left the program open ended, saying that it would keep buying the bonds until the job market showed substantial improvement.	2	2	1		4
The Fed also said at the September meeting it plans to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero through at least mid-2015.	1	1	1		4
