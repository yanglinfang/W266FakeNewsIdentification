Orioles beat Red Sox 6-3, clinch playoff berth	1	2	2		3
BALTIMORE (AP) — The champagne was on ice, plastic shields were in place above the cubicles in the Baltimore clubhouse and couches were removed to accommodate a celebration 15 years in the making.	1	2	1		3
The party never happened — at least not at the ballpark.	2	1	2		3
Baltimore clinched its first playoff berth since 1997, but not until late Sunday when the Texas Rangers beat the Los Angeles Angels 8-7 in the finale of a day-night doubleheader.	1	2	1		3
After the Orioles beat the Boston Red Sox 6-3 earlier Sunday, around two dozen players and coaches took scoreboard watching to a new level by staying on the field at Camden Yards and rooting for the Rangers to win the opener,	1	2	2		3
Orioles players exchanged high-fives and fist-bumps following their fourth straight win, then gathered along the first-base line to watch the scoreboard telecast of the ninth inning, which began with Texas winning 4-3.	1	2	1		3
Many in the crowd of 41,257 stood and watched, too.	1	1	1		3
But a two-run double by Torii Hunter put the Angels in front and ruined the fun.	1	2	2		3
As the Orioles walked off the field, manager Buck Showalter waved to the crowd and offered a fist-pump of encouragement.	1	2	1		3
Sitting in front of his locker with a beer in his hand, first baseman Mark Reynolds said, "It would have definitely been cool to celebrate with our fans.	2	2	1		3
They've been supporting us all year.	2	2	1		3
To be able to celebrate out there with them and take in the moment, it would have been pretty neat."	2	2	1		3
Baltimore, on the other hand, is looking to go into the postseason as AL East champions.	1	2	1		3
The Orioles remain tied atop the division standings with the New York Yankees, who rallied to beat Toronto 9-6 and also clinched no worse than a wild-card berth.	2	2	2		3
Both contenders have three games left.	1	1	1		3
New York begins a season-ending series against visiting Boston on Monday night, and the Orioles travel to Tampa Bay.	1	1	1		3
Baltimore held out hope of cracking open a few cases of champagne in Florida.	2	2	1		3
"I take particular enjoyment in ruining someone else's clubhouse," reliever Darren O'Day said.	2	2	2		3
Shortstop J.J. Hardy added, "I'm not going to say there's no disappointment, but we all understand we need to keep playing good baseball to get where we want to be.	2	1	2		3
We'll just worry about ourselves and win the next three games."	2	2	2		3
Who'd have thought the Orioles would be talking about division titles, playoff berths and champagne after 14 consecutive losing seasons and four straight last-place finishes?	2	2	2		3
The Orioles (92-67) already have 23 more wins than a year ago.	1	2	1		3
"Our goal now is try to figure out a way to play some more baseball games here at Camden," Showalter said.	1	1	1		3
"Hopefully, it's see you later."	2	1	1		3
Hardy, Nate McLouth and Chris Davis hit solo homers, and Jim Thome drove in two runs for Baltimore.	1	2	1		3
The Orioles completed a sweep and went 13-5 against Boston, their most wins in a single season versus the Red Sox since 1970 (13-5).	1	2	1		3
Joe Saunders (3-3) allowed three runs, eight hits and no walks in 7 1-3 innings for Baltimore.	1	1	1		3
Obtained in a late-August trade with Arizona, Saunders has yielded a total of 12 earned runs in his last six starts.	1	1	1		3
Jim Johnson worked the ninth for his 50th save.	1	1	1		3
Cody Ross and Daniel Nava homered for the last-place Red Sox, who have dropped five straight and 16 of 22. Boston (69-90) last lost 90 games in 1966.	1	2	2		3
"We haven't had a good season," manager Bobby Valentine acknowledged.	2	1	2		3
Zach Stewart (0-2) gave up five runs and seven hits, including two homers, in 2 2-3 innings.	1	1	2		3
In three starts this season he's surrendered eight home runs.	1	1	2		3
After being beaten and bashed by the Orioles, who hit seven homers in the three-game series, the Red Sox now head to Yankee Stadium.	2	1	3		3
A sunny, breezy fall afternoon couldn't have started much better for the Orioles.	2	2	1		3
After the video board showed the Yankees and Angels losing early, McLouth hit the fourth pitch from Stewart over the left-field wall.	1	2	2		3
"After that just trying to do damage control," Stewart said.	2	1	2		3
"Try to keep it at that score.	2	1	1		3
Obviously I didn't do that."	2	1	2		3
Hardy and Davis followed with singles before Stewart hit Jones with a pitch to load the bases.	1	1	1		3
After Matt Wieters bounced into a run-scoring 4-6-3 double play, Thome followed with grounder up the middle that beat the shift and rolled into the outfield, scoring Davis for a 3-0 lead.	1	2	1		3
Boston wasted doubles in the second and third innings before Hardy led off the bottom of the third with his 22nd home run.	1	1	2		3
Jones singled with one out, and Thome chased Stewart with an RBI single.	1	1	1		3
Ross homered in the fourth to get the Red Sox to 5-1.	1	2	1		3
Davis connected off Clayton Mortensen in the fifth, his 31st homer of the season and fourth in four games.	1	2	1		3
Nava homered in the seventh with a man on.	1	2	1		3
NOTES: Jones was chosen Orioles MVP in a vote among media covering the team, the second straight year he's won the award.	1	2	1		3
"It is given to me, but I think the whole team deserves it," he said.	2	2	1		3
... Boston hit three doubles and now has a major-league leading 214 for the season.	1	1	1		3
... Red Sox RHP Clay Buchholz, who's 2-4 with a 5.84 ERA lifetime against the Yankees, starts Monday night against CC Sabathia.	1	1	1		3
Rookie Wei-Yin Chen (12-10) starts for Baltimore in Tampa Bay against Alex Cobb (10-9).	1	1	1		3
