(Reuters) - U.S. power producer Dynegy Inc , which counts billionaire financier Carl Icahn among its shareholders, said on Monday it has emerged from Chapter 11, less than a month after winning court approval for its bankruptcy plan.	2	2	2		4
The Houston-based company said it will have about $800 million in liquidity in the form of cash and will have eliminated more than $4 billion in debt through the Chapter 11 process.	2	2	2		4
In exchange for the elimination of debt and other obligations, unsecured creditors will receive equity representing a 99 percent stake in the reorganized company and $200 million in cash.	2	2	2		4
Dynegy Inc, which will have approximately 100 million shares outstanding after the reorganization, is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3 under the symbol "DYN".	2	1	1		4
Other Dynegy shareholders include a Franklin Resources Inc unit.	1	1	1		4
As part of the reorganization, on September 30, Dynegy Holdings LLC merged with and into the parent company Dynegy Inc.	1	1	1		4
Dynegy Inc filed for bankruptcy in July while Dynegy Holdings filed for protection from creditors on November 7, burdened by costly power plant leases and amid a dispute over whether its parent had acted properly two months earlier in taking about $1.25 billion of its coal-powered plant assets.	2	1	3		4
Creditors of Dynegy Inc and its Dynegy Holdings LLC unit had voted overwhelmingly in favor of their joint bankruptcy reorganization plan.	2	2	3		4
But some units like Dynegy Northeast Generation Inc, Hudson Power LLC, Dynegy Danskammer LLC and Dynegy Roseton LLC did not emerge from bankruptcy and remain under Chapter 11 protection.	1	1	2		4
