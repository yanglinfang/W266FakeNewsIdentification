Air Force Launching Secretive X-37B Space Plane in October, Could Land in Fla.	1	1	1		4
The U.S. military's hush-hush robotic X-37B space plane is slated to blast off again next month, Air Force officials say.	1	2	1		4
The mission will test the robotic spacecraft's reusability and may eventually land on the Florida runway once used for NASA space shuttles.	1	1	1		4
The X-37B space plane's next mission — called Orbital Test Vehicle-3, or OTV-3, because it is the program's third-ever spaceflight — is scheduled to launch aboard an Atlas 5 rocket from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) sometime in October.	1	1	1		4
"Preparations for launch at Cape Canaveral have begun," said Major Tracy Bunko at the Pentagon’s Air Force press desk.	1	1	1		4
"We are on track to launch OTV-3 next month; however, the exact date remains subject to change based on range conditions, weather, etc."	1	2	2		4

As with the X-37B program's two previous spaceflights — OTV-1 and OTV-2 — OTV-3's payload and mission details are classified.	1	1	1		4
But the focus remains on testing vehicle capabilities and proving the utility and cost-effectiveness of a reusable spacecraft, Bunko told SPACE.com.	1	1	1		4

Bunko said in an earlier communiqué that this third flight will use the same X-37B spacecraft that flew the first test flight, the OTV-1 mission, back in 2010.	1	1	1		4
That maiden voyage of the miniature space plane lasted 225 days.	1	1	1		4
It launched into orbit on April 22, 2010, and then landed on Dec. 3 of that year, zooming in on autopilot over the Pacific Ocean and gliding down onto a specially prepared runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.	1	1	1		4
A different X-37B vehicle made a similar Vandenberg touchdown this past June 16, having stayed in orbit for 469 days on its OTV-2 mission.	1	1	1		4
The X-37B program is being run by the U.S. Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office.	1	1	1		4
The two space planes — which are 29 feet (8.8 meters) long and 15 feet (4.5 m) wide, with a payload bay about the size of a pickup truck bed — were built by Boeing Government Space Systems.	1	1	1		4
While they're sparing with details about the X-37B program, Air Force officials say the vehicles enable them to test out how new technologies perform in space.	2	3	1		4
“One of the most promising aspects of the X-37B is it enables us to examine a payload system or technology in the environment in which it will perform its mission and inspect them when we bring them back to Earth,” Bunko said.	2	3	1		4
“Returning an experiment via the X-37B OTV enables detailed inspection and significantly better learning than can be achieved by remote telemetry alone.”	2	2	1		4
A new landing site?				I	4
While both previous X-37B missions touched down at Vandenberg, the Air Force is considering landing future flights at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, next door to the Cape Canaveral launch site.	1	1	1		4
In fact, the Air Force is currently conducting taxi and braking tests as part of an ongoing appraisal.	1	1	1		4
The prospect of a returning the robotic space plane to the KSC landing strip — which was used by NASA's now-retired space shuttle fleet — is seen as a cost-saving measure.	2	3	1		4
"We are also considering consolidating landing, refurbishment and launch operations at KSC or CCAFS in an effort to save money," Bunko said.	1	3	1		4
“We are seeking to leverage previous space shuttle investments and are investigating the possibility of using the former shuttle infrastructure for X-37B OTV landing operations," Bunko added.	1	2	1		4
"Those investigations are in an early state, and any specifics will not be known for some time, but could potentially be used as early as for the landing of OTV-3."	1	2	2		4
