WACO, Texas (AP) â€” Several businesses in the Central Texas town of Waco (WAY'-koh) are dealing with a smelly problem that won't go away: decaying cricket carcasses.	1	1	3		4
A bank, a drugstore and other businesses have been inundated with the odorous onslaught of dead crickets that have been trapped inside walls and have collected on sidewalks.	1	1	3		4
Jani Rodriguez, the branch manager at Synergy Bank, tells the Waco Tribune-Herald (http://bit.ly/QcSOLs)	1	1	1	S	4
that scented products have been unable to get rid of the smell.	1	1	2	S	4

Fred Huffman, an entomologist who runs a local pest control business, says the cricket problem has been worse this year because mild winter conditions resulted in the insects appearing earlier than normal.	1	1	2		4
Health officials say the crickets don't pose any direct health risks.	1	2	1		4
