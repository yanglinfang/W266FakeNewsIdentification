BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovak officials rejected the overwhelming results of a popular Internet campaign to name a new pedestrian and cycling bridge near the capital after U.S. action film star Chuck Norris.	2	2	3		4
Despite 12,599 votes for the Norris name in a two-month online poll, Bratislava regional assembly decided to call the bridge spanning the Morava river and Slovakia's border with Austria the "Freedom Cycling-Bridge" in memory of people killed attempting to escape communist eastern Europe.	3	2	2		4
The assembly's choice earned only 457 votes in the online poll, where it was easily outshone by other proposed names, including "Maria Theresa" after an Austro-Hungarian empress and "the Devinska cycling bridge" in honour of a nearby village.	3	2	2		4
"We have unanimously voted for the Freedom Cycling-Bridge," Bratislava region chairman Pavol Freso told reporters.	4	2	1		4
"It truly is a place where people were running for freedom through barbed wire, it is a place where many have died, so this is a dignified way how to honour these people."	3	3	2		4
Slovakia, once part of the former Czechoslovakia, has a 107 km border with Austria and many people died trying to flee the communist regime before its collapse in 1989.	1	1	3		4
Norris, a martial arts expert-turned film star, is known for playing tough guy characters in such classic movies as "Lone Wolf McQuade", "Missing in Action" and "The Delta Force".	2	2	1		4
The actor's work has become a popular source of kitschy fun among Slovaks and a mainstay for local jokes about macho strength and invincibility.	2	3	1		4
