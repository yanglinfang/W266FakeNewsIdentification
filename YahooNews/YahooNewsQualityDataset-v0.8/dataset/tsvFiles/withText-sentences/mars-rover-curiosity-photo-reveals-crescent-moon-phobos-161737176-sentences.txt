Mars Rover Curiosity Photo Reveals Crescent Moon Phobos	1	2	1		4
NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has been doing more than just driving around the Red Planet and taking pictures of rocks.	1	3	1		4
It's been doing a bit of Martian moon-gazing too.	2	2	1		4
The Curiosity rover's latest Mars photo captured the planet's largest Martian moon, Phobos, during a Martian evening, revealing the satellite as a faint crescent moon.	2	2	1		4
"Moon Over Mars: I snapped a pic of one of Mars' moons, Phobos, in the twilight sky over Gale crater," NASA's Curiosity team announced on the mission's Twitter page @MarsCuriosity, writing as the rover itself, on Wednesday (Sept.	3	2	1		4

The photo shows Phobos as a faint white crescent that almost blends in with the Martian sky.	1	1	1		4
A black blemish also appears in the image, but is merely the result of a bad pixel in the image data, rover officials said.	1	1	2		4
"When you send images from 179 million miles away, stuff happens," they added via Twitter. 	2	1	2		4
The new photo of Phobos is Curiosity's latest view of Martian moons from the surface of the Red Planet.	1	2	1		4
Earlier this month, Curiosity snapped photos of Phobos as it crossed part of the sun, creating a partial solar eclipse on Mars.	1	2	1		4
Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, both of which are much smaller than Earth's moon.	1	1	1		4
Phobos is about 14 miles wide (22 kilometers), making it the largest Martian satellite.	1	1	1		4
Deimos is about 9.3 miles across (15 km) at its largest point and is farther from Mars than Phobos. 	1	1	1		4
The Curiosity rover's Phobos photos are just part of the science work the car-size robot has been performing on Mars.	1	1	1		4
The rover landed inside the planet's vast Gale Crater on Aug. 5 and is currently driving toward its first science destination, a location called Glenelg.	1	1	1		4
On Wednesday, Curiosity drove 160 feet (48.9 meters) closer to Glenelg, marking its longest single drive of its mission so far.	1	1	1		4
To date, the rover has covered about a quarter-mile (416 meters) on Mars.	1	1	1		4
NASA's Mars rover Curiosity is expected to spend at least two years exploring Gale Crater to determine if the region could have ever supported microbial life.	2	2	1		4
Mission scientists plan to drive the rover up a 3-mile (5-km) mountain — Mount Sharp —that rises from the crater's center.	1	1	1		4
NASA will hold a press conference today at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) today to update the media and public on Curiosity's progress on Mars.	1	1	1		4
