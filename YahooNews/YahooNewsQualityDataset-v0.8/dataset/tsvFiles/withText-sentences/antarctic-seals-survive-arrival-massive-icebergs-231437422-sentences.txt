Antarctic Seals Survive Arrival of Massive Icebergs	1	2	1		4
After an enormous iceberg called B-15 broke off from Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf, it released chunks of ice — themselves massive icebergs — that wreaked havoc on emperor penguins that breed to the west.	2	1	2		4
But this doesn't appear to have been the case for a population of Weddell seals whose breeding sites were also in the icebergs' path, new research has found.	2	2	2		4
The calving of the 4,250-square-mile (1,100 square kilometers) B-15 iceberg gave researchers a unique opportunity to examine how living things respond to an extreme event in their environment — in this case, the arrival of the chunks of B-15.	2	3	1		4
Previous research has examined the impact of extreme events on emperor penguins.	1	1	1		4
At one of the penguin breeding sites, collisions between the icebergs and the ice on which the penguins were nesting killed some and forced others to move to less-ideal breeding sites.	1	1	3		4
At another site, an iceberg blocked the penguins' route to the open water where they feed, a research team led by Gerald Kooyman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography reported in 2007.	2	1	2		4

Weddell seals vs. ice chunks	1	1	2		4
In the latest study, another team looked at how the icebergs affected the seals living in Erebus Bay on the Ross Sea.	1	1	1		4
Scientists have been monitoring the seal population there since 1969, and they honed in on the period from 2001 through 2005, when the remnants of B-15, which calved in 2000, passed through.	2	1	1		4
"Here, what we found is a pretty mild effect on the seals," said Thierry Chambert, a doctoral candidate at Montana State University and the lead researcher on the project.	2	1	1		4
"They survived pretty well during the five years of iceberg presence, but their reproduction was lower than usual."	2	2	2		4
Chambert and colleagues focused on female seals, since they are more reliably spotted on the ice than males.	1	1	1		4
They found that in four of the five years in which the icebergs were present, the number of females that showed up at the colony was lower than usual.	1	1	2		4
In addition, the probability that an individual female would be alive the following year did not change, but reproduction rates dropped.	1	1	2		4
In years without icebergs, there is a nearly 70-percent chance a female will give birth to a pup.	1	1	1		4
During the iceberg years, this dropped by about 20 percentage points, down to a 50-percent chance.	1	1	2		4
How seals respond	1	1	1		4
Researchers don't know why the icebergs had the effect on the seals that they did, but they have some hypotheses.	2	1	1		4
The icebergs may have made the seals' breeding sites more difficult to access by altering the terrain of the sea ice.	2	1	2		4
Other work has shown that the icebergs had a negative effect on the amount of tiny, floating plants, called phytoplankton, in the sea.	1	1	2		4
This effect could have rippled up the food chain to the seals, which feed on various fish species and other Antarctic foods.	1	1	2		4

The seals had a few advantages over the penguins.	1	2	1		4
Unlike the emperor penguins, which must traverse the ice to feed, the female seals generally stay put once they haul out at the breeding site.	2	1	1		4
The seals may also have benefitted from being farther from B-15 when it broke off the ice shelf, Chambert said.	2	2	1		4
Chambert and colleagues believe that the drop in reproduction is indicative of seals' strategy for dealing with difficult times.	3	2	2		4
Seals can live up to 30 years, and they breed annually beginning at age 6, meaning if they miss a year or two, they will have a chance again later.	1	2	1		4
"This is a long-lived species.	1	1	1		4
Because of that, you expect a strategy that will favor survival over reproduction," he said.	2	2	1		4
By putting off reproduction, the seals can spend more energy on survival.	1	2	2		4
This gives them the chance to breed again when conditions are better.	1	2	1		4
The researchers note the icebergs were only around for a short period.	1	1	1		4
More frequent iceberg calving, such as those predicted as a result of global warming, could have had a more negative effect on the seal population, the researchers write.	3	1	3		4
