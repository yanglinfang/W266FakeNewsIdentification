Niger to reduce fuel prices after China loan rate cut	1	2	1		5
NIAMEY (Reuters) - Niger will reduce the cost of fuel at the pumps by about 7 percent next year as a result of China cutting the interest rate on a loan taken out to pay for the West African country's sole oil refinery, the oil minister said on state television.	2	2	1		5
The move will curb the threat of further social unrest in the West African state, where riots over fuel prices have cost at least two lives this year.	2	1	3		5
There have also been several strikes by taxi drivers over the cost of locally produced fuel.	2	1	2		5
However, the price cut at the pumps will cost the government 14.5 billion CFA francs in lost revenue, Niger's trade minister said.	2	1	2		5
Niger started pumping oil late last year in a joint project with China, which provided a $980 million loan to help to fund the SORAZ refinery in Zinder, 700km east of the capital, Niamey.	1	1	1		5
China's Export-Import Bank agreed in July to cut the rate on the loan to 2 percent, paid back over 20 years, from a rate of Libor plus 3.1 percent over ten years.	1	1	1		5
Foumakoye Gado, Niger's oil minister, said late on Thursday that the rate cut will reduce production costs at SORAZ and "lead, in January 2013, to a 40 CFA franc reduction in the cost of fuel at the pump".	2	2	1		5
The retail price is currently 579 CFA francs per litre.	1	1	1		5
Tax on oil-related products will be cut to 12 percent from 15 percent as part of the move, but Trade Minister Saley Saidou said: "The decision will cost the state 6.5 billion CFA in tax receipts and it will cost the refinery 8 billion CFA."	2	1	1		5
The refinery, which can produce 20,000 barrels of oil a day, is 60 percent owned by China's CNPC, with Niger owning the other 40 percent.	1	1	1		5
