Czechs set first presidential election for Jan 11-12	1	1	1		4
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs will hold their first presidential election on January 11 and 12 to replace outgoing euroskeptic leader Vaclav Klaus, the speaker of the upper house of parliament said on Monday.	2	1	1		4
Up to now, the country's parliament has chosen the president.	1	1	1		4
But the assembly agreed to hand that power over to the electorate amid calls for more open democracy, fuelled by a growing public perception of cronyism and corruption in the country's political parties.	2	2	3		4
Opinion polls suggest the leading candidates to replace Klaus are former prime ministers Milos Zeman and Jan Fischer, in office from 1998-2002 and 2009-2010, respectively.	1	1	1		4
Both men are much more in favor of closer cooperation with the European Union than Klaus.	2	2	1		4
Both were members of then Czechoslovakia's totalitarian Communist party before the collapse of the Soviet Union.	1	1	1		4
Fischer is running as an independent candidate while Zeman has the support of a leftist SPOZ party, a small splinter group from the center-left Social Democratic party he used to lead.	1	1	1		4
Political analysts say their popularity is another reminder of the public's exasperation with the country's larger, mainstream parties, following a round of harsh austerity measures and sleaze scandals.	3	2	3		4
Czech presidents do not have the executive powers held by the leaders of France or the United States.	1	1	2		4
But they wield significant influence over the cabinet and parliament through their ability to delay legislation and appoint prime ministers and other officials.	2	2	1		4
The office, held by anti-communist dissident and writer Vaclav Havel from 1990-2003, is held in high esteem in the country of 10.5 million people.	2	2	1		4
Senate speaker Milan Stech said an anticipated second round run-off between the top two candidates for the presidency would take place two weeks after the first round of the election.	1	1	1		4
