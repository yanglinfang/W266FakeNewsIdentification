BOISE, Idaho (AP) â€” A woman who was about to be released from an Idaho prison will stay behind bars a while longer because federal prosecutors say she mailed a threatening stick figure drawing to a relative.	2	1	2		4
Linda Joyce Lakes was serving time at the Pocatello Women's Correctional Center on probation violations stemming from a 2007 grand theft sentence, and she was scheduled to be released last Friday.	1	1	2		4
But earlier this month, the U.S. attorney's office charged her with mailing threatening communications, a felony.	1	1	2		4
Prosecutors say that in 2010, Lakes mailed a drawing that apparently depicted a battered stick figure alongside threatening phrases such as "No tears," ''No hiding," and "No more you."	2	1	2		4
Kyle Wright, an FBI agent in Pocatello who investigated the case, described the drawing in a court document.	1	1	1		4
"One stick figure appeared to be lying down with his face smashed.	2	1	2		4
The baseball bat was lying nearby with damage that appeared to be consistent with its use on the first stick figure.	2	1	2		4
The second stick figure appeared to be walking away with a smile," Wright wrote.	2	1	1		4
Wright also said in his affidavit that Lakes sent a letter with the drawing that indicated her prison sentence was coming to an end and that the recipient should be prepared for his final moments.	1	1	1		4
The FBI agent also said that Lakes told the FBI her drawing symbolized her hate for a man who had abused her in the past, and that one day she wanted to beat and possibly kill him.	2	1	3		4
Lakes was released from the state prison and taken into federal custody.	1	1	1		4
She waived her preliminary hearing on the charge and has not yet entered a plea.	1	1	1		4
Lisa Tolle, a paralegal with Federal Defender Services of Idaho in Pocatello, said her office had just been assigned the case and attorneys had not yet fully reviewed it.	2	1	1		4
