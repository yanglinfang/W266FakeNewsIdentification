NASHVILLE, Tenn.	1	1	1	S	4
(AP) â€” Emmylou Harris loves Mumford & Sons for a special reason.	1	3	1	S	4
"They're making the banjo respectable, which is not an easy feat, and I'm so glad it's finally happening," Harris joked.	2	4	1		4
Harris, an iconic singer and member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, and Mumford & Sons, platinum-selling lads from London who have sparked a folk rock resurgence, are joining together to explore their shared love of high harmony, sad songs and, yes, the oft-belittled banjo on an episode of "CMT Crossroads" on Thursday night.	3	2	1		4
The Nashville-based Harris had only briefly met lead singer Marcus Mumford before agreeing to do the show based on the waves they created in the music world.	2	1	1		4
They coordinated song choices by phone and got together to rehearse for a little more than a day before recording the show earlier this month.	1	1	1		4
It was a crash course in catalog consumption and the chance to get to know each other.	2	2	1		4
"They're great harmony (singers) and they've got this great driving groove with a minimalist instrumentation," Harris said.	3	3	1		4
"But they just sound good and the songs have beautiful melodies and I love harmonizing on them."	3	3	1		4
She said it proves her theory that music is going to keep reinventing itself in good ways.	2	2	1		4
"You don't have to repeat the past.	2	1	1		4
We learn from the past, but we have to come forward with something different and there are just so many different combinations to make good music that touches people," she said.	2	2	1		4
Harris, 65, was among the gateway artists who helped Mumford and bandmates Ben Lovett, Ted Dwane and Winston Marshall discover their love for American roots music.	1	3	1		4
It started with the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack.	1	1	1		4
Harris appeared with Gillian Welch and Alison Krauss on the memorable song "Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby."	2	2	1		4
That eventually led them to the Old Crow Medicine Show and then deep immersion in old-timey sounds from America's long-neglected past.	3	1	1		4
They ran across Harris' imprint many times along the way, and with the help of dobro master Jerry Douglas, they help explore that legacy on the show.	2	1	1		4
"Pretty much every song that Emmylou has sung on is my favorite song of whichever artist she sang with," Mumford said.	3	3	1		4
"I'm like an obsessive Emmylou Harris freak and I'm not ashamed."	4	3	1		4
In turn, the quartet has helped shine a light on the influence Harris and the extensive roots underground still exerts.	2	3	1		4
The band, which releases their new album, "Babel," this week, were a growing success story in that community when they appeared on the 2011 Grammy Awards with Bob Dylan and the Avett Brothers, launching Mumford & Sons into the national popular consciousness.	2	3	1		4
Their album "Sigh No More" is now double platinum and "Babel" is one of the year's most anticipated albums.	2	3	1		4
"For us, it's kind of a bit of a dream come true," Dwane said.	3	4	1		4
"We'd never thought we'd get to travel so extensively, meet our heroes and collaborate with so many people.	3	4	1		4
... We're just having a really nice time."	3	4	1		4
Like the band, fans have discovered something new in those old sounds.	1	1	1		4
Mumford & Sons routinely drew 10,000 and more fans on their Gentleman of the Road tour across the U.S. this summer, almost all of them dancing along to Marshall's banjo.	2	3	1		4
"Folk music has always been there, but it's wonderful to see the infusion of freshness and energy, but still having that passion," Harris said.	2	3	1		4
"Not just mimicking what went before, but infusing it.	2	1	1		4
I was joking about the banjo, but I'm serious."	3	1	1		4
