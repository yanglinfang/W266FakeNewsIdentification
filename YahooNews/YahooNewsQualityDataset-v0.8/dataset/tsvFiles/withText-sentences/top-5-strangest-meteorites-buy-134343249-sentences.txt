On Oct. 14, pieces of asteroids, the moon and Mars that have landed on Earth go up for sale in a public auction in Manhattan.	1	1	1		4
These meteorites may have originated in space, but many create tantalizing tales — or hint at future calamity — when they collide with Earth.	2	1	2		4
From the more than 125 meteorite pieces and related material going up for sale at Heritage Auctions, here are five with the strangest space-rock stories.	2	1	1		4
The only known fatality	1	1	1		4
On the evening of Oct. 15, 1972, farmhands in Trujillo, Venezuela, heard a sonic boom.	1	1	1		4
The next morning, a large rock was found alongside a dead cow with a crushed neck and clavicle.	1	1	2		4
Years later, scientists confirmed the rock, which in the meantime had served as a doorstop, was a meteorite, according to the catalog description of New York City's Heritage Auctions for a partial slice of the Valera meteorite.	1	1	1		4

This is the only known meteorite responsible for a fatality, at least to date.	1	1	3		4
"It is going to happen, and it's going to be a very sad day.	3	1	3		4
It is inevitable that people will be killed by a meteorite," said Darryl Pitt, the meteorite consultant for the auction.	2	1	3		4
He added that when he speaks to children, this is the first thing they ask about.	2	1	1		4
He said he tells them to "worry about the things they have control over."	2	1	2		4
The only asteroid tracked to Earth	1	1	1		4
The potential for a devastating impact from an asteroid or comet is real, and astronomers are keeping an eye out for this type of threat.	1	1	2		4
On Oct. 6, 2008, Richard Kowalski, at the Catalina Sky Survey, spotted a new asteroid, dubbed 2008 TC3, on a collision course with Earth.	1	1	2		4
For the first time, astronomers around the world tracked the asteroid's approach for the day before it hit Earth.	1	1	1		4
The asteroid exploded upon entering Earth's atmosphere, and as predicted, it fell in the Nubian Desert of Northern Sudan, where 35 pounds (15.9 kilograms) of meteorites were eventually found.	1	1	1		4
Much of its mass is believed to have been vaporized or to have disintegrated when it hit Earth's atmosphere.	1	1	1		4
It was renamed Almahata Sitta, Arabic for "station six," a railroad stop on the line to Khartoum near where the meteorites were found, according to the auction catalog description.	1	1	1		4

An 'accident' with a Chevy	1	1	1		4
Almost 20 years ago, on Oct. 9, 1992, video cameras at Friday night football games in the northeastern United States caught the fiery descent of a meteorite that would end its fall by punching through the trunk of a red Chevy Malibu parked in Peekskill, N.Y.	1	1	2		4
The owner of the car, 18-year-old Michelle Knapp, sold the car within a week for 25 times the $400 she paid for it when buying it from her grandmother, according to the catalog.	1	2	1		4
Not only are two pieces of this meteorite for sale, collectors also have a chance to purchase the original title to the Malibu and the bulb from the rear tail light, which exploded when the car's trunk was punctured by the meteorite.	1	1	1		4
Chained to Earth	1	1	1		4
In 1492, a stone fell from the sky outside the walled city of Ensisheim, located in the Alsatian region of France, preceded by "a great thunder clap, then a long noise that was heard far around," the auction catalog quotes a 16th-century document.	1	1	1		4
The stone's descent was seen as a sign from God; the extraterrestrial origin of meteorites would not be accepted for another 300 years.	2	1	2		4
The Ensisheim meteorite was brought into the city and chained up in church to keep it Earth-bound.	1	1	1		4
It is Europe's oldest preserved meteorite.	1	1	1		4
Hopes for a cure	2	1	1		4
On Aug. 14, 1992, residents of the Nigerian city of Mbale heard a loud explosion that became a rumbling, accompanied by a white smoke trail in the sky.	1	1	1		4
Then rocks rained down, pelting an area of about 1.9 by 4.3 miles (3 by 7 kilometers).	2	1	2		4
One small meteorite even struck a young boy after ricocheting off a banana tree.	1	1	2		4
Because the region was being ravaged by AIDS, Mbale residents believed the meteorite shower brought a cure from God, and they ground up the stones into a paste that was eaten or applied topically, the auction catalog recounts.	1	1	1		4
Within several months, 426 stones weighting 238 pounds (108 kilograms) had been recovered from this large meteorite shower.	1	1	1		4
The auction, held by Heritage Auctions, is scheduled to take place on Sunday, Oct. 14, at the Fletcher-Sinclair Mansion at 2 East 79th Street in Manhattan.	1	1	1		4
