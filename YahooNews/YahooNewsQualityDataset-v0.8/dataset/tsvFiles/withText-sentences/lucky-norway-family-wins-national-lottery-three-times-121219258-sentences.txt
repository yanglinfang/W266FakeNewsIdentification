Lucky Norway family wins national lottery three times	2	3	1		5
OSLO (Reuters) - Good fortune and having children just seem to go together for Norwegian mother Hege Jeanette Oksnes.	2	2	1		5
Each time the 29-year old petrol station attendant from tiny Austevoll island off Norway's west coast gives birth, someone in her family wins the national lottery.	1	2	1		5
"This is completely insane... we don't even play the lottery that often," Oksnes said only days after the family collected 12.2 million crowns ($2.12 million) with their third lottery win in six years.	3	3	1		5
Oksnes, who serves hot dogs at a petrol station, gave birth to her first child in 2006 just one day after her father Leif won 4.2 million crowns on the national lottery.	1	3	1		5
Three years later, Oksnes herself won, claiming 8.2 million crowns one day before giving birth to her second child.	1	3	1		5
To complete the hat-trick, Oksnes' 18-year-old brother Tord won the very same lottery this weekend, just months after she gave birth to her third child.	2	2	1		5
After three children though, it may be time to call it quits.	3	1	1		5
"My husband thinks we have enough money now," she said.	2	2	1		5
Oksnes bought new cars with her winnings and did a bit of travelling, but has put most of the money in the bank, hoping to find a dream property to build a new house.	2	2	1		5
