VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - An Italian man clambered onto a ledge on the huge dome of St Peter's Basilica on Tuesday to stage a precarious protest against Prime Minister Mario Monti and the European Union.	3	1	3		4
Video footage showed the man, identified as Marcello Di Finizio, jumping over railings near the top of the 137-m- (450- ft-) high dome on Tuesday afternoon, shocking visitors taking a tour.	2	1	2		4
He then tied a cord to the railings and abseiled to a ledge over a window in the cupola.	1	1	1		4
Tottering on the ledge, Di Finizio unveiled a banner reading: "Help!	2	1	2		4
Enough Monti, Enough Europe!	3	1	3		4
Enough Multinationals!".	3	1	3		4
He remained on the dome into Tuesday night, flashing a strobe light as Vatican police and firefighters worked to find a way to bring him down to safety.	1	1	2		4
Alex Giuzio, a friend of the protester, told Reuters that Di Finizio owns a beach bar that rents out parasols and lounge chairs to sunbathers.	1	1	1		4
He said he is angry about a European Union directive and Italian government plan that will see licences to operate patches of seafront auctioned off transparently from 2016.	3	1	2		4
Beach workers say the plan will favour multinational companies over smaller local businesses.	3	1	2		4
Di Finizio has staged several public protests against the plans, and had already climbed out onto St Peter's dome during a shorter protest in July when he demanded a meeting with Tourism Minister Piero Gnudi, according to beach industry website Mondo Balneare.	2	1	3		4
