Tyler Giuliano, 15, was wearing a ski mask and appeared to be armed when he was shot on Thursday by his father, who authorities declined to identify, said Lieutenant J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police.	1	1	3		4
The father's sister, who lives next door, was home alone before 1 a.m. when she called him to report someone trying to break into her home.	1	1	1		4
The father went over to investigate and was approached by a masked person dressed entirely in black and holding a shiny object, police said in a statement.	1	1	1		4
"Believing the suspect was armed with a weapon and about to attack him, the (father) discharged his personal handgun at the suspect," police said in the statement.	1	1	2		4
Giuliano was pronounced dead at the scene.	1	1	3		4
"(He) was lying on the ground in the driveway with obvious gunshot injuries, holding a weapon," the statement said.	2	1	2		4
Vance declined to further describe the weapon.	1	1	1		4
Authorities seized the father's gun, were investigating whether it is registered and will consult with the state's attorney to determine if any charges will be filed, Vance said.	1	1	1		4
Police also were investigating why the teen, who has no criminal history, was outside his aunt's home.	1	1	1		4
"We truly don't know.	3	1	1		4
We'll look at the family dynamics, (his) school locker, cell phone, computer to figure out what's going on," Vance said.	3	1	1		4
