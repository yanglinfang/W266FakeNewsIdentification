The chips are capable of reading data at 140MB/s and writing data at 50MB/s.	1	1	1		
“With 128GB of the new embedded memory storage, mobile handsets and tablet PCs can store up to 15 full HD, 8GB equivalent video files.”	1	1	1		
Samsung didn’t announce any new smartphones that will utilize the new 128GB chips yet, but it’s safe to say they will probably show up in a future revision of the Galaxy S smartphones or iPhone.	3	1	1
