Mitt Romney's strategy to win Virginia: Lyme Disease?	1	1	2		3

"It's a disease that begins from a small bug," reads the mailer.	1	1	2		3
"But Lyme Disease has quickly become the most common vector-borne disease in the United States."	1	1	2		3
The mailer, which describes Lyme Disease as a "massive epidemic threatening Virginia," promises that a President Romney would take action to bring the disease under control.	2	2	2		3
