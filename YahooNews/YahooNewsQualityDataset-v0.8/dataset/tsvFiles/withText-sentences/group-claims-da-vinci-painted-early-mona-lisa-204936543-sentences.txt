The Mona Lisa Foundation, which owns the "Isleworth Mona Lisa," says that after 35 years of research, experts believe it predates the famed 16th-century masterpiece by about a decade.	1	1	1		5
The Isleworth painting — likewise a portrait of a young woman with an enigmatic smile — is slightly larger, was painted on canvas and has brighter colors than the famed Louvre Museum masterpiece painted on wood.	1	1	1		5
The group is presenting its findings to reporters Thursday in Geneva.	1	1	1		5
An accompanying book to be released by the foundation says the Isleworth Mona Lisa — which was in storage for decades — drew news headlines in the early 20th century.	1	1	1		5
