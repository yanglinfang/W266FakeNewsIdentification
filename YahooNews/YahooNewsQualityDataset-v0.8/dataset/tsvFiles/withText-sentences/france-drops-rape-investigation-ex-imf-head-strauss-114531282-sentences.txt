France drops rape investigation into ex-IMF head Strauss-Kahn	1	2	3		4
LILLE, France (Reuters) - France's public prosecution service said on Tuesday it was shelving an investigation into allegations that disgraced former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a man once tipped to become president of France, had engaged in group rape.	2	2	3		4
The prosecution service said in a statement it had taken the decision after a young woman retracted an allegation against the 63-year-old, who is also fighting wider accusations of sexual misdemeanor in France and a civil case in the United States.	3	2	3		4
Strauss-Kahn's legal team welcomed what amounted to a partial victory for their client, who has asked a court to end a wider French inquiry into sex parties organized out of the northern city of Lille.	2	2	2		4
"This is a common sense decision," Richard Malka, a lawyer for Strauss-Kahn, told i>TELE television.	2	2	1		4
"The fight goes on."	2	1	1		4
Strauss-Kahn was about to announce he would run for the French presidency when police arrested him in May 2011 in New York after a hotel maid alleged he had tried to rape her.	2	2	3		4
New York prosecutors dropped those charges, citing concerns about the credibility of the accuser, but hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo is now pursuing him in a civil case and his legal battles have piled up since his return to France.	2	2	3		4
In the so-called Carlton Affair, named after a luxury hotel in the northern French city of Lille, investigators are trying to establish whether Strauss-Kahn participated in sex parties to a degree that amounted to actively encouraging prostitution.	2	1	4		4
Having sex with prostitutes in France is not illegal but pimping is.	1	1	3		4
