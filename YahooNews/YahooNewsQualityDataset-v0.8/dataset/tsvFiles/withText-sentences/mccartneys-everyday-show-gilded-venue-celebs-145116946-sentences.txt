It's hard to be casual when you were born with one of the most famous dads on the planet — but she got full marks for trying.	3	2	2		4
Silhouettes ignored the waist, with a cool, low-slung belted vibe, and the big curves of last season were gone.	3	3	1		4
Thinking outside the box, McCartney created some fantastic elliptical curves in vibrant saffron yellow and forest green.	3	3	1		4
With delicate dense knife pleats these ellipses visually sculpted a feminine shape that was highly flattering to busts and waists, like a geometric hourglass.	3	2	1		4
Some of the broderie anglaise looks added a play on transparency, but the best of the show came with an on-trend safari theme.	2	2	1		4
Black and white camouflage print looked fantastic on a silky jumpsuit, worn by sassy model of the moment Karlie Kloss.	2	2	1		4
This look wasn't exactly everyday, but it's sure going to sell.	3	2	1	I	4
