Iranian news agency picks up Onion article as fact	2	1	1		
CHICAGO (AP) â€” A joke by the satirical newspaper The Onion appears to have gotten lost in translation.	3	1			
An Iranian news agency has picked up as fact a story from the paper about a supposed survey showing a majority of white Americans would rather vote for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (ah-muh-DEE'-neh-zhahd) than President Barack Obama.	1	1	1		
The only trouble is it was made up, like everything in the just-for-laughs newspaper, which is headquartered in the comedic capital Chicago.	2	1	1		
The English-language service of Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency republished the story Friday, several days after it appeared in The Onion.	1	1	1		
The Iranian version is copied word-for-word from the original.	1	1	1		
It leaves out only The Onion's description of Ahmadinejad as "a man who has repeatedly denied the Holocaust and has had numerous political prisoners executed."	2	1	4
