In a recorded interrogation presented by prosecutors during the trial, David Viens, 49, can be heard saying he cooked the body of his 39-year-old wife, Dawn, in late 2009 until little was left but her skull.	2	1	5		
The chef spoke to authorities from a hospital bed in March 2011 after leaping off an 80-foot cliff in Rancho Palos Verdes.	1	1	3		
Authorities say he jumped after learning he was a suspect in her disappearance	1	1	3		
The trial relied heavily on recorded interviews with authorities in which the chef acknowledged the crime in detail.	2	1	2		
"I just slowly cooked it and I ended up cooking her for four days," Viens could be heard saying on the recording.	4	1	5		
Viens, who attended his trial in a wheelchair, said in the interview that he stuffed his wife's body in a 55-gallon drum of boiling water and kept it submerged with weights.	1	1	5		
He said he mixed what remained after four days with other waste, dumping some of it in a grease pit at his restaurant in Lomita, and putting the rest in the trash.	1	1	3		
He said he stashed his wife's skull in his mother's attic in Torrance.	1	1	3		
But a search of the house turned up nothing, nor did an excavation of the restaurant.	1	1	1		
On the recording played in court, Viens was asked what happened on Oct. 18, 2009, the night his wife disappeared.	1	1	1		
He said he had noticed money missing from his restaurant and suspected his wife.	1	1	2		
They got into an argument, he said, and he forced her onto the floor where he wrapped her up and put a piece of duct tape over her mouth before going to bed.	1	1	4		
He awoke to find her dead and panicked, he said.	2	1	4		
Viens had pleaded not guilty.	1	1	1
