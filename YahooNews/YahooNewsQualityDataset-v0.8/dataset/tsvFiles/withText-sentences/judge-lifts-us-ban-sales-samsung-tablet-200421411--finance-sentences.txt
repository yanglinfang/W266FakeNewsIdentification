The judge had previously banned U.S. sales of the tablet pending the resolution of a sweeping patent trial between Apple Inc. and Samsung over vital technology used in smartphones and tablet computers.	2	1	2		4
A jury in September ordered Samsung to pay Apple $1 billion after finding many of Samsung's products illegally used technology developed by Apple for its iPhones and iPads.	1	1	3		4
But the jury found that Samsung's Galaxy 10.1 wasn't one of the offending products.	1	2	1		4
The judge scheduled a December hearing to consider Samsung's demand for a new trial.	1	1	1		4
