PHOENIX (AP) â€” Authorities still haven't released the identity of a man who fatally shot himself in the head on live national television at the end of a high-speed carjacking chase that began in Phoenix and ended close to the California border.	1	1	3		4
Fox News was covering the chase that began about midday Friday using a live helicopter shot from Phoenix affiliate KSAZ-TV.	1	1	1		4
The man driving a copper-colored four-door sedan stopped, ran into the desert and placed a handgun to his head and fired.	1	1	3		4
The man was declared dead at the scene, according to Sgt.	1	1	3	S	4

Fox News anchor Shepard Smith told viewers that the video was supposed to be on a 10-second delay so it could be cut off from airing if something went awry.	2	1	1		4
"We really messed up, and we're all very sorry," Smith said.	4	1	2		4
Fox apologized for showing the violence on air.	2	1	2		4
"We took every precaution to avoid any such live incident by putting the helicopter pictures on a five second delay," said Michael Clemente, executive vice president of news editorial.	2	1	1		4
"Unfortunately, this mistake was the result of a severe human error and we apologize for what viewers ultimately saw on the screen."	3	1	2		4
More frequently than its rivals, Fox News Channel picks up car chases from its local affiliates and airs them live.	1	1	1		4
It's gripping television, a live mystery with no clear resolution, and often provides a short-term ratings boost as viewers tune in to see how it ends.	2	1	1		4
Critics say the chases themselves rarely rise to the level of national news.	2	1	1		4
The Phoenix station was not airing the chase live when it ended.	1	1	1		4
Thompson said the man allegedly stole a car from a couple at gunpoint outside a Phoenix restaurant just before 11 a.m.	2	1	2	S	4
MST.	1	1	1	S	4
Police officers located the vehicle and began a pursuit and the man fired several shots, Thompson said.	2	1	2		4
He said at least one shot hit the police vehicle but the officers escaped injury.	2	2	2		4
The suspect headed west on Interstate 10, then pulled onto a dirt road near the town of Tonopah that Thompson said was "70 to 80 miles east of the California line."	2	1	1		4
TV footage showed the man exiting the vehicle and running erratically in a field before putting the gun to his head and firing.	1	1	3		4
He then fell to the ground.	1	1	1		4
"Efforts to revive him were not successful and he was dead at the scene," Thompson said.	2	1	3		4
"We don't have an ID yet."	2	1	1		4
Fox returned repeatedly to shots showing the car passing big-rig trucks that typically travel at about 70 mph as if they were standing still.	2	1	1		4
Police cars did not appear to be immediately behind the car during most of the chase.	2	1	1		4
Smith was narrating the video and clearly had his doubts about what was being shown from the moment the man stopped the car.	3	1	1		4
"This scares me," he said.	3	1	2		4
"You wait for the end of these things and you worry about how they may end up," he said.	3	1	2		4
"This makes me a little nervous, I got to tell you.	3	1	2		4
A little nervous."	3	1	2		4
After the man shot himself, Fox's picture quickly cut to Smith, who was shouting "get off, get off, get off, get off."	1	1	1		4
Smith apologized repeatedly following the commercial break.	1	1	1		4
"That didn't belong on TV.	3	1	2		4
We took every precaution we knew how to take to keep that from being on TV and I personally apologize to you that that happened," he said.	3	1	2		4
