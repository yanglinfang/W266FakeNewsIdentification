America's unexpected addition of 386,000 more jobs: 4 takeaways	2	1	1		4
The Labor Department added a new wrinkle to the presidential campaign on Thursday, when it reported that the economy actually added 386,000 more jobs than previously thought from April 2011 to March 2012.	2	1	1		4
President Obama's team welcomed the revised figures, saying they proved "we are making progress" toward recovering "from the worst crisis since the Great Depression."	3	3	2		4
GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney's campaign said the rosier figures don't change anything.	2	1	1		4
"There are 23 million Americans struggling to find work right now," Romney adviser Kevin Madden said, "and the president has nothing more to offer than tax hikes and more regulations."	2	1	2		4
What exactly does the unexpected uptick in employment figures really mean?	3	1	1		4
Here, four significant points to consider:	3	1	1		4
1. We shouldn't be shocked by these revisionsThis doesn't mean companies went "on a previously undetected hiring spree," says Ben Casselman at The Wall Street Journal.	3	1	1	S	4
"The Labor Department just got access to better data."	1	2	1		4
The feds make monthly estimates based on a survey of 160,000 employers, then, once a year, revise the employment figures based on actual tax records.	1	1	1		4
That's "more accurate — but much less timely."	2	2	2		4

2. And should treat the monthly jobs reports with a grain of saltPoliticians and economists always pounce when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly jobs report, says Brad Plumer at The Washington Post.	3	1	1	S	4
But this latest revision "suggests that we could all probably stand" to cool it a bit.	2	1	1		4
Why put so much emphasis on numbers that are "almost never the last word on how the economy’s actually performing"?	3	1	1		4
In 2009, "the economy actually lost 902,000 more jobs than the monthly jobs reports had initially suggested."	2	1	2		4
In 2011, it turns out the jobs reports underestimated the number of jobs being created by an average of 67,000 jobs per month.	2	1	1		4
3. This deprives Romney of a key talking pointThis news is great for America, but terrible for Mitt Romney, says Steve Benen at MSNBC.	2	2	2	S	4
He probably was looking forward to arguing in next week's debate "that the economy hasn't added any new jobs during Obama's term."	3	1	2		4
That talking point "was always ridiculous," given that employment was already plummeting downward when Obama took office, making it grossly unfair to pin early 2009 job losses on him.	4	1	2		4
Now, though, Romney's "talking point is off the table entirely," because the new figures mean the economy has added a net total of 125,000 jobs on Obama's watch, instead of losing 261,000 as previously estimated.	3	2	1		4
"It also means more jobs were created in Obama's first four years than during George W. Bush's first four years — and Bush didn't inherit a global economic catastrophe."	3	2	1		4
4. But the GOP still has plenty of ammo against ObamaThe fact that the Labor Department just "magically" created a bunch of jobs "changes nothing," says Conn Carroll at The Washington Examiner.	4	2	2	S	4
The job market today is still "incredibly weak," and it "has gotten weaker the past two months."	2	1	2		4
Not only that, but the employment news was offset by a fresh flurry of scary economic data — durable good orders fell in August by the most since the recession, and second-quarter economic growth was downgraded from 1.7 percent to 1.3 percent.	3	1	2		4
Even with these jobs, "the Obama economy is failing."	3	1	2		4
