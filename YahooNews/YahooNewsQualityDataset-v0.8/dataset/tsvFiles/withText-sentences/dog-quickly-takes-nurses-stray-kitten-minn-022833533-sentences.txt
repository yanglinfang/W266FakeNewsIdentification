JORDAN, Minn.	1	1	1	S	
(AP) — A Minnesota woman says she was shocked when her small dog began caring for an abandoned kitten, then started producing milk and nursing the fuzzy gray stray to health.	2	1	2		
Pat Weber says the kitten was days old when her grandson found it in the family's barn in early September in Jordan, about 40 miles southwest of Minneapolis.	1	1	1		
She says the 2-inch-long kitten was "ice cold."	2	1	2		
But she felt it move, so she wrapped the kitten in a warm towel.	2	1	1		
Then it began meowing — and her 4-year-old Pekingese perked up.	2	1	1		
The tawny pooch named Mittens began licking the kitten, who nuzzled in and began suckling.	2	1	1		
Mittens hadn't had puppies in two years, yet she eventually began producing milk.	1	1	1		
She's been nursing the kitten ever since.	1	1	1		
Weber calls it a miracle.	2	2	1
