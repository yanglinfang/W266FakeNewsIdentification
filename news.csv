1	1-handball-several-montpellier-players-arrested-171754628--spt	(Adds quote, background)PARIS, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Several Montpellier handball players have been arrested after an investigation into an alleged match-fixing scandal, a police source told Reuters on Sunday.The source, who declined to be identified, said the players had been arrested after Montpellier's league game at Paris St Germain.They were expected to be transferred to the Paris suburb of Nanterre for questioning by police, the source added.A judicial source said on Tuesday that French champions Montpellier were involved in an investigation relating to a first division match they lost at Cesson-Sevinge on May 12.Club president Remy Levy told the local newspaper Le Midi Libre that he had been spoken to as part of the investigation but denied the club had been involved in match-fixing.Montpellier will become plaintive in the case to "defend (their) honour", according to Levy, a move that would allow them privileged access to the case files."I cannot confirm nor deny because I'm a plaintive in the case", Levy told Reuters on Sunday.Montpellier, the 2003 European champions, have been the French champions every year since 2008.(Reporting by Nicolas Bertin; Writing by Julien Pretot; Editing by John Mehaffey)	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	3	2	1	2	2	4
2	10-pages-lost-most-fans-facebooks-purge-153723567	Lady Gaga's Facebook page has lost the equivalent of three Madison Square Gardens packed full of little monsters this week.[More from Mashable: Instagram Now Has More Daily Active Users on Mobile Than Twitter [REPORT]]Facebook began removing fake likes from brand pages on the social network earlier this week as part of a continued effort to boost the site's integrity. As a result, Lady Gaga's page lost 65,505 fans from Tuesday through mid-Thursday, the third-highest drop in likes of any fan page, according to data provided to Mashable by FanPageList, which tracks numbers for official Facebook fan pages and Twitter accounts.FanPageList analyzed the top 500 pages on Facebook and found that seven of the ten pages that lost the most followers belonged to celebrities, including Rihanna, Shakira and Justin Bieber. The other three pages were for games: Texas Holdem, CityVille and Mafia Wars.[More from Mashable: Kenny Chesney Kicks Off His Shoes With New App]Texas Holdem's Facebook page lost nearly 200,000 fans in this time period, by far the biggest overall decline of any page. CityVille's page lost 72,631 fans, making it the second biggest decline.Don't feel too bad for these accounts though. When Facebook announced the decision to eliminate likes, it said brand pages would lose less than 1% of their total fans on average and sure enough, that appears to be the case. All of the brand pages in the top 10 lost fewer than one third of one percent of their total fans. Just a few brand pages in the top 500 lost between 1%-2% of their fans, including Breaking News and Air New Zealand.For the most part, it appears the worst of Facebook's like purge has passed. FanPageList found that most of these brands lost far fewer fans Thursday than during the previous two days. Some pages like those for Rihanna and Justin Bieber are actually back to adding fans today, rather than losing them.Here are the 10 pages that lost the most total fans this week following Facebook's purge:1. Texas Holdem Poker: -198,344 fans (-0.30%)2. CityVille: -72,631 fans (-0.29%)3. Lady Gaga: -65,505 fans (-0.12%)4. Rihanna: -49,861 fans (-0.08%)5. Shakira: -48,359 fans (-0.09%)6.

3	10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905	Figuring out what to include on your résumé can be a real headache. Too much information, and you risk overwhelming the reader. Too little, and you might not stand out from the crowd. The trick to striking the right balance is including the most effective information, especially things that might catch a hiring manager's eye. Here are 10 surprising items you might want to include on your résumé.PoliticsConventional wisdom says don't talk about politics at work, but surprisingly, experts say including political stances on your résumé is a good way to see if you are a good fit for a company."Every job seeker wants to find common ground and a connection to the company or hiring manager," said Chris Westfall, a professional development coach and author of "The New Elevator Pitch" (Marie Street Press, 2012). "What better way to make a connection than through the causes that you support? If you support causes that are not encouraged by your employer, that's something you need to know before you accept the job!"Lots of detailsDon't worry that you'll overwhelm the person reading your résumé with too much detail. Details about your responsibilities at past jobs will help a hiring manager decide if you're a good fit."Hiring managers want specific, quantifiable examples of your past successes, not mere job descriptions of past positions you held," said Charles Purdy, senior editor and career-advice expert at Monster.com. "Find a way to tell stories of how your past work improved a company's or organization's bottom line, and use those numbers."FailuresThe last items you'd think belong on your résumé are the things you did wrong at your last job, but one expert says featuring your failures can actually help you get a job."One non-intuitive thing employers want to see on a résumé is failure," said Phil Rosenberg, president of reCareered.com. "Employers want to see that you've tried, failed and learned from your failure, all on a prior employer's dime. This demonstrates innovation, willingness to teach risks, [and] faster reaction and response time. It is also a learning experience, and failure teaches success."[10 Reasons to Do What You Love for a Living]TravelDetails about your travel experience might seem out of place on a professional résumé, but that's not the case, one recruiting expert says."I love to see job seekers who have spent a decent amount of time abroad, [whether] for education, employment or volunteer work," said Rachel Dotson, content manager at ZipRecruiter.com. "This type of experience suggests several important things about the candidate. For example, they are not afraid to leave their comfort zone, they are aware and independent, and they have worked in unfamiliar situations with unfamiliar groups. While there is no guarantee that these characteristics are true of every person who has gone abroad, the experience itself is certainly enough to pique my interest."Low-level jobsEven if you think that some of your past jobs are trivial, one expert says they may still help you get a job. Cody Teets, author of "Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers that Began at McDonald's" (Cider Mill Press, 2012) said employers know that working at a fast-food restaurant isn't easy, and it can help a job seeker’s resumé stand out.Teets, who is now vice president and general manager of McDonald's Rocky Mountain region, said employers value the things that workers learn at their early jobs. At McDonald's, for example, workers learn to operate as part of a team, to challenge themselves and to roll with the punches, all skills that will come in handy at any job.QR codesLest you think using a QR code (Quick Response code, or matrix barcode) on your résumé will make you look a little too eager, one hiring expert said, it will actually have the opposite effect."Even if the QR code might only contain a link to the person's LinkedIn profile, or their phone number, it shows a comfort level [with] and knowledge of technology," Bruce Hurwitz, president and CEO of Hurwitz Strategic Staffing.Side projectsEven if potential employees are working on side projects unrelated to the full-time job they are seeking, it may be worthwhile to include those efforts on a résumé, one expert said.Any kind of side venture, side business or project that could be indirectly related to the full-time work you're pursuing is a good idea, said Dana Leavy-Detrick, small business consultant at Aspyre. "This is a great way to show employers that you're using your own time to acquire and grow skills outside of the job that will help you develop and contribute in the long-run. It's also a great way for job seekers to engage in the type of work and learn the type of skills that really interest them."[10 Foolish Résumé Mistakes That Could Cost You the Job]Awards or recognitionOne expert also suggests job candidates should forget about being humble and should brag a bit on their résumés. In particular, you should be sure to include any past awards on your résumé."One thing that top employers consistently seek out is proof that a given candidate is uncommonly talented or driven," said Mike Junge, a recruiting, staffing and career expert. "This is particularly true if the talent or drive is directly relevant to the job at hand, but it's also true for applicants who have competed at a high level in other areas. High-performing companies are always looking for an edge in the marketplace, and having a team of competitive and passionate employees on board can provide a significant advantage."Non-traditional résumésDon't be afraid to ditch the traditional résumé and try something different, one expert says. One option growing in popularity among many job seekers is a video résumé."Including a link to a video résumé is a great way to set yourself apart from the crowd and impress hiring managers," said Josh Tolan, CEO of onlinehiring-network, Spark Hire. "On video, job candidates can show off their personality, communication skills and ambition. It can help hiring managers get a better insight into the candidate and will allow them to envision how the candidate would fit into the company culture. Employers want to see job candidates who are confident and able to come up with creative solutions to common problems, and video résumés are a great way to” demonstrate just those qualities.SportsEven if you don't play anymore, competing as an athlete can help you get a job."Many hiring managers proactively search for and prioritize candidates who have played college sports, particularly as part of a team sport," said Susie Hall, president of talent agency, Vitamin T. "Most often, those candidates know what it takes to function as part of a team, from pulling your own weight to jumping in to do what's necessary to win. If they've carried a sport into college, they've had to work that into a busy schedule and cut into precious free time. So they're likely to know how to juggle priorities. They are also inspired to win."This story was provided by BusinessNewsDaily, a sister site to LiveScience. Follow David Mielach on Twitter @D_M89 or BusinessNewsDaily @bndarticles.

11	2012-emmys-top-5-predictions-122800431	It's time once again for TV's A-list to squeeze into their tuxes and gowns, practice their strategically "spontaneous" thank-you speeches, and brave Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet. On Sunday night, the 64th annual Emmy Awards will air on NBC, with TV's most acclaimed series vying for the glory — and the ratings bump — that comes with the graceful gold statuette. Unsurprisingly, critics are already second-guessing the night's successes, surprises, and snubs. Here, 5 predictions for the 64th annual Primetime Emmy Awards:1. Whatever your predictions, it's going to be an uncharacteristically unpredictable nightWhen Survivor host Jeff Probst wasn't even nominated in the Best Reality Show Host category — an award he's won since the category was created in 2008 — it was a sign that "something new" was finally happening with Emmy voters, says Lisa de Moraes at the Washington Post. As a result, the Emmys are looking "particularly treacherous" to previous winners and prognosticators. Previous shoo-ins like The Daily Show may be in for an unpleasant surprise on Sunday night.SEE ALSO: Revolution: Has TV finally found the next Lost?2. Mad Men's reign as Best Drama might be overAMC's Mad Men is gunning for a record-breaking fifth consecutive Best Drama Emmy, but critically-acclaimed British costume drama Downton Abbey — which aired earlier this year on PBS — could break the streak. Historically, says Jill Serjeant at Reuters, "British imports often do well at U.S. awards shows." Another potential bad omen for Mad Men? It "emerged empty-handed from last weekend's Creative Arts portion of the Emmys," which honors achievement in costuming and hairstyling — two aspects of Mad Men that have formerly been recognized as strengths.3. But Modern Family's reign continues unabatedThere's plenty to like about every show in the Best Comedy category, but "it's unlikely anything can stop the glorious Modern Family's march to a third straight Emmy," says TV Guide. The only potential spoiler for the ABC sitcom is CBS' The Big Bang Theory, which "keeps getting better and better as it beefs up the wacky women's roles," but it's far more likely that the Dunphy family will be adding another trophy to ABC's mantel.4. The winners for Lead Actor/Lead Actress in a Drama are basically guaranteedThe Lead Actor and Lead Actress categories "are a lock" for Bryan Cranston of AMC's Breaking Bad and Claire Danes of Showtime's Homeland, says Kristin Dos Santos at E! Online. With three consecutive wins, Cranston is "the undefeated heavyweight champ" of the Lead Actor category and his series-best performance in Breaking Bad's fourth season should earn him a fourth trophy. And Danes' starring turn in Homeland is "the indisputable breakout female performance of the year." Do any of her co-nominees stand a chance? Just "try to find a single Emmy expert predicting anyone other than Danes" and you'll have your answer.5. But Lead Actor/Lead Actress in a Comedy are much harder to guessLouis C.K. deserves to win for his "balls-to-the-wall" starring role in FX's black comedy Louie, says Jace Lacob at The Daily Beast. But will he earn the Emmy he so richly deserves? Not likely, says Maria Elena Fernandez; Jim Parsons' "huge sentimental moment in the finale" of The Big Bang Theory will earn him a third Emmy award. But the seven strong performances in the Lead Actress in a Comedy category makes it "one of the toughest categories in the entire awards ceremony this year" — though the frontrunners are Julia Louis-Dreyfus for HBO's Veep and Amy Poehler for NBC's Parks and Recreation.View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	3	3	3	2	3	3	1	2	2	2	2	3	3	2	2	4
12	2012-enthusiasm-gap-democrats-republicans-more-fired-092500113--election	Through most of this year's presidential campaign, the conventional wisdom was that Republican voters were more enthusiastic than their Democratic counterparts. The reasoning seemed air-tight: As Americans of all stripes grew frustrated with enduring economic pain, conservatives, who despise President Obama, were itching for the chance to replace him in the White House with Mitt Romney, and many of Obama's supporters were growing disillusioned. A new Gallup poll, however, suggests that over the summer, the tide turned. In the 12 swing states likely to decide the presidential contest, Gallup says, the parties were equally enthusiastic in June. Since then, both parties have picked up enthusiasm, as have independents, but Democrats have gained the most. They now hold a significant lead, with 73 percent of battleground Democrats saying they are very or extremely charged up about voting, compared to just 64 percent of Republicans. Are Democrats the ones who now hold the enthusiasm edge?No question. Democrats are more pumped: "The bad news for Romney keeps on coming," says Jon Walker at Firedoglake. He's trailing in polls, and voters give him lower marks than Obama on almost every issue. Now his enthusiasm edge has evaporated. The GOP was banking on heavy turnout to put them over the top, as their base fired up to kick Obama out of office. What they weren't counting on was that "disdain for Romney" makes Democrats "even more motivated" to keep Mitt out of the White House."Democratic enthusiasm surges"SEE MORE: Is Ben Bernanke trying to help Obama win re-election?Democrats are on an unsustainable sugar high: If you watched the Dems' "Abortion-Palooza" of a convention, says Ed Morrissey at Hot Air, you know Obama is going for a big turnout among diehard Democrats instead of trying to win over moderates. Obama's poll bounce and enthusiasm burp suggest the strategy "paid dividends." Based on Obama's deflating tracking-poll numbers, though, he won't be able to sustain the energy to keep up with the GOP's steadily surging spirits over the "two-month grind ahead." "Gallup: Democratic enthusiasm surges in swing states, nationally"It depends how you slice it: Obama's indeed leading among likely voters — 50 percent to 45 percent, according to a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey, says Chris Cillizza at The Washington Post. Romney still has the advantage, though, among the likeliest voters — "that slice of the most enthusiastic slice of the electorate." It's hard to say who the math favors. The only certain thing is that in a close race "small margins matter," so victory could go to the side that musters more enthusiasm in a couple of swing states."The enthusiasm gap (or not) — in 2 charts"SEE MORE: Obama's convention bounce: What it means for the raceRead more political coverage at The Week's 2012 Election Center.View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	3	3	3	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	4

15	4-percent-children-u-households-lived-household-experienced-140000263	WASHINGTON, Sept. 19, 2012 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- About 2.8 million children or 3.9 percent of all children in U.S. households lived in a household in which at least one member age 12 or older experienced nonfatal violent crime in 2010, according to a report released today by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).About 6 million fewer children in 2010 than in 1993 lived in a household victimized by violence, a 68 percent decline over the 18-year period. Over a more recent 10-year period (2001–2010), the number of children living in a household that experienced violence fell about 37 percent.This BJS report estimates the prevalence of violent victimization among U.S. households with children age 17 or younger. The prevalence rate is the percentage of households in which at least one member age 12 or older experienced one or more violent victimizations in a given year. These estimates are an indicator of the extent to which children have direct and indirect exposure to violent victimization.In 2010, violent crime was about twice as prevalent in households with children (3.6 percent) compared to households without children (1.8 percent). More children lived in households where a victimization occurred outside the home (1.7 million or 2.4 percent) compared to inside the home (1.2 million or 1.7 percent).An estimated 1.1 million children lived in a household that experienced a serious violent crime, which includes rape, sexual assault, robbery and aggravated assault. Nearly 1.8 million children lived in a household that experienced a simple assault.Other findings showed—The special report, Prevalence of Violent Crime among Households with Children, 1993–2010 (NCJ 238799), was written by BJS statisticians Jennifer L. Truman and Erica L. Smith. The full text of the report, related documents and other BJS statistical resources can be found on the BJS website at http://www.bjs.gov/.The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), headed by Acting Assistant Attorney General Mary Lou Leary, provides federal leadership in developing the nation's capacity to prevent and control crime, administer justice, and assist victims.

The rise of photo editing apps has added to this movement toward mobile photography, which is becoming a burgeoning and reputable art form.[More from Mashable: 4 Tips to Avoid Work-From-Home Email Scams]It may seem like iPhone users, or "iPhoneographers," dominate this art form, but there's a sizeable "Androidographer" community as well, especially on platforms like Google+, Instagram and Flickr.We spoke to five photographers who use their Android devices -- exclusively or in addition to other cameras -- to shoot, edit and share beautiful photos, and they offered some advice for those looking to enter the field.[More from Mashable: 5 Easy Steps To Make Your Job Descriptions Go Viral]"Shooting with my Droid is my favorite thing to do with my clothes on," Stokes says. She finds her Android device, with its camera and sharing capabilities, to be a perfect immediate art form. "The more pictures I took, the more I saw what could be achieved, and the more I liked it," she says.Stokes enjoys shooting nature -- waterscapes, flowers, sunrises and sunsets -- as well as anything she sees during the day with an interesting light or unusual aspect. "My Android device inspires me with its versatility ... and absolutely beautiful color and results," she says.Stokes mentions that mobile photographers should make shooting with their phones a habit, or a ritual -- that way, it will "quickly, almost automatically, become one of your favorite art forms.""I use my Android because it fits in my pocket or purse in a way a DSLR just doesn't," she says. "Not having a million settings forces me to think about the photo in a different way."Cowden advises mobile photographers to make sure the lens is always clean, and to always be on the lookout for natural light. "Since the camera phone is not very adjustable, I try to start out with good lighting so I can focus on framing and composition," she says.For Tidmore, the benefit of using an Android device extends past its convenient size -- he likes that everything is maintained on one device. "It's being able to do all of my editing, and upload [photos] to a social network, all on my phone no matter where I am," he says. "I have a job where I'm out and about all day, and being able to create on my phone while I should be working is awesome."His main piece of advice for mobile photographers? Experiment with apps. "There is no shortage of photography apps in the App Store or Google Play. Spend a lot of time working with different ones until you find your 'style' or something that really clicks with you," he advises. "Other than that, shoot often ... and have fun!"Hamelin uses editing apps like UCam Ultra Camera (which allows him to focus easier) and Pixlr-o-matic for filters. The HTC Desire also includes camera software that creates panoramic photos."I always try to have pictures that tell stories or at least that give a feeling," Hamelin says. "All my pictures taken with my smartphone are made to be seen by my friends that live far away from me [in Belgium], so I try to put what I feel inside."Hamelin suggests that fellow mobile photographers "look everywhere, shoot, move, shoot again -- the more you take pictures, the more you find what works and what does not.""Convenience is the biggest factor," Mistry says. "I have my phone on me all the time, and it has a pretty good camera attached to it. I do usually carry my DSLR around with me, too, but sometimes it's just quicker to get that snapshot with my phone." She explains that being able to share her photos instantly is another reason why her smartphone's camera comes in handy.Mistry is an advocate for editing photos, but she advises mobile photographers to be smart about it."I know there's a lot of backlash against filters on your photos, and I can understand [that] backlash," she says. "Which is why I say use filters, but don't abuse filters. Don't feel the need to add a filter if your photo doesn't need it. Sometimes a photo is perfectly brilliant without a filter over the top of it."This app is a no-brainer. Simple and intuitive, Photoshop Express lets you make the necessary adjustments to crop, exposure, color, tint, hue, saturation, contrast and levels with ease. You can create artistic looking shots with the swipe of your finger when you add many of the classic filters from Photoshop, including "Lens zoom," "Grain" and "Glow."While somewhat simple, the app works well. Plus it’s free — so, if you don’t already have it, you should be uploading it now.Price: FREEClick here to view this gallery.Image courtesy of iStockphoto, franckreporter.This story originally published on Mashable here.	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	4	3	2	3	2	2	1	4	4

19	5-ways-mitt-romney-fix-ohio-problem-071400086--election	No Republican has won the presidency without winning Ohio, and that would appear to be true for Mitt Romney as well — without Ohio's 18 electoral college votes, the Republican nominee's path to the White House is exceedingly narrow. The problem for Romney: He's losing Ohio. A new Washington Post poll has President Obama up by 8 percentage points in the Buckeye State, and while "that's on the high end of recent margins," says Alexander Burns at Politico, "the trend is unambiguously in the president's favor." Even with early voting moving up the vote-casting starting gun, Romney can still win Ohio — and the presidential race — but it won't be easy. Here are five ways Romney can turn things around and solve his big "Ohio problem":1. Make his Romney-Ryan bus tour countAs it turns out, this is Ohio week for the Romney campaign — the candidate and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) are on a three-day bus tour of the state. It's the first time in three weeks that Romney and Ryan, a favorite of conservatives, have appeared together, and Romney is pushing an aggressive Ohio-specific attack on Obama letting China cheat at trade. This is Romney's last best chance to win over his most crucial swing state, says NBC News' First Read team. "If this week's bus tour doesn't move the needle, as the Romney campaign might say, they very well could decide to all but write off the Buckeye State."SEE MORE: Was Mitt Romney really the GOP's best candidate?2. Convince Ohio voters to like him moreRomney's biggest obstacle in Ohio is that voters there just aren't that into him, says Nate Cohn at The New Republic. Since early September, "Romney's unfavorable ratings exceeded 49 percent in every poll of likely voters," and his favorable ratings are, on average, 7 points lower. "Obama has never been Ohio's favorite son, but it's hard to envision how Romney pulls off a comeback if a majority of voters outright dislike him." Whether it's through glowingly positive ads or some other means, "if Romney is to have any shot at all, he needs to turn around his image over the next month."3. Rev up the Republican baseEven among voters who do like Romney, he faces a notable "Ohio enthusiasm gap" with Obama, says Chris Cillizza at The Washington Post. In the new Washington Post poll, Romney and Obama fans are roughly on par in their excitement about their candidate. "But, drill down another level and you see some differences emerge": 56 percent of Obama voters are "very" enthusiastic, versus 46 percent for Romney. "That's not an insignificant difference when it comes to the likeliest of likely voters." The poll's brutal 8-point Obama lead is based on a Democrat/Republican/Independent sample that skews Democratic: 37/30/30, says Ed Morrissey at Hot Air. "That's a far cry from the [2010] midterm 36/37/28 — but it's not that far off from 2008's 39/31/30." To win, Romney has to make the electorate look more like 2010 than 2008.SEE MORE: The Mitt Romney we have always known4. Crush Obama in the debatesRomney strategists say the campaign's internal poll numbers are much tighter than the public polls, putting Romney within the margin of error. But that could mean a 4-point deficit against Obama — about the average of recent polling. "Team Romney's hope is that they can tighten the race to just a couple of points heading into the first debate," says Politico's Burns, then "make up the rest of the difference through a combination of strong debate performances and a robust field operation." That isn't too different from their national game plan, "except the stakes are even higher in Ohio."5. Give up on Ohio and focus on other statesLook, "at some point in every election, it becomes clear that certain states regarded as 'tossups' are probably lost causes for one candidate or the other," says Liz Marlantes at The Christian Science Monitor, and in Ohio, we've perhaps "reached a point where Romney should just cut his losses and move on," focusing "like a laser" on Florida, Virginia, and the other remaining states "he can — and, in fact, absolutely must — win." One proponent of this theory? Karl Rove, who pointedly noted on Fox News this week that "there are 11 different ways to win without Ohio." When the man who engineered George W. Bush's 2004 victory on an Ohio-focused strategy declares "the Buckeye State a lost cause," says Alec MacGillis at The New Republic, it's probably time to listen.SEE MORE: Mitt Romney releases his 2011 tax return: 4 takeawaysRead more political coverage at The Week's 2012 Election Center.View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	4	4	4	2	4	2	2	4	3	1	3	3	1		4	4

PigsFamily members of 69-year-old Terry Vance Garner were shocked to discover the hog farmer's dentures and an undisclosed body part in the family's pig enclosure several hours after Garner went missing. Authorities think Garner either suffered a heart attack or was knocked over by the 700-pound animals before being killed and eaten. His brother describes the self-professed animal lover as a "good-hearted guy" whose animals were his life.SEE MORE: The flesh-eating seagulls that are attacking whales2. A hippoLast year, a 40-year-old former Army major was killed in South Africa after being savagely bitten to death by his pet hippopotamus, Humphrey. The man had adopted the 1.2-ton creature when it was just 5 months old, after the animal was rescued from a flood. "Humphrey's like a son to me, he's just like a human," he said. "There's a relationship between me and Humphrey and that's what some people don't understand." Experts have since noted that hippos are actually the most dangerous animals in Africa, killing more people each year than lions, elephants, leopards, buffalo, and rhinos combined.3. CatsIn 2010, dozens of cats had to be removed from a northwestern Pennsylvania home where coroners said the animals had started gnawing at the foot of a dead man, 74, and his deceased mother, 94. The man had apparently been the caretaker for his mother, who died of dehydration after her son suffered a heart attack. Left with no other source of food besides their owners' corpses, the cats' survival instincts apparently took over.SEE MORE: Is it wrong to hunt wolves as soon as they're off the endangered species list?4. PugsIn 2009, a small pair of pugs in Nebraska survived for two weeks on the deceased corpse of their owner after he shot himself. After being found, the dogs were subsequently put up for adoption. A Humane Society spokesman said the animals were unlikely to suffer any lasting psychological damage because "they don't have memories like people."5. Burmese pythonIn 1996, a 19-year-old Bronx man died after being attacked by his pet Burmese python. It's likely that the 13-foot-long reptile mistook the man for food after it escaped its cage. The man was found by his neighbors in a pool of blood with the snake coiled around his torso in his apartment building's hallway. According to the man's brother, the victim had purchased the snake at a local pet store for $300 a few months earlier.SEE MORE: Are the world's most endangered species even worth saving?6. Lizards, tarantulas, spiders, and other bugsLoner Voegel, 30, lived in 2007 in a small German apartment in the city of Dortmund with a small zoo of more than 200 snakes, geckos, and insects. Apparently, he was killed by a black widow bite and subsequently gorged upon by the other crawly creatures. Neighbors alerted police after the stink emitting from his home became too unbearable. "It was like a horror movie," says Britain's The Sun. They found the man's corpse on the sofa with large chunks of flesh missing. "Giant webs draped him, spiders were all over him. They were coming out of his nose and mouth," said police.Sources: Associated Press (2, 3), Guardian, New York Times, The SunSEE MORE: The futuristic brain implant that makes monkeys smarterView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	4	4	4	1	4	2	2	4	3	1	3	1	1	3	3	
21	6-ways-mitt-romney-win-first-presidential-debate-072300329--election	Pollsters tell us that the presidential debates don't really have much of an effect on who wins the White House, but that's neither accurate nor, frankly, very much fun, says Robert Draper in GQ. In fact, "all sorts of things can happen — most of them bad — when two of the world's most insulated creatures are suddenly thrust into an oppressive atmosphere consisting of a desolate stage, grim-faced inquisitors, a stone-silent live audience, and an invisible American electorate monitoring every blink and stammer." Whoever comes out ahead, especially in the first debate, will probably win in November. That's great news for Mitt Romney, says surrogate Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey. Romney's "had a tough couple of weeks," but he'll nail Wednesday night's debate and "this whole race is going to turn upside down come Thursday morning." Here are six things Romney can do to make Christie's confident — and off-message, for a team that wants to lower expectations — prediction come true:1. Romney needs a memorable zingerTeam Romney has come to believe that the debates are about creating "moments," and they've "equipped him with a series of zingers that he has memorized and has been practicing on aides since August," say Peter Baker and Ashely Parker at The New York Times. That's exactly the right strategy, says Robert Shrum at The Daily Beast. And "Mitt can land a tough punch," as he showed in the GOP primary debates. I doubt Romney has "a zinger for the ages" in him, says Mark Samburg at the Hartford Courant, but he can surely "muster up something that we'll still be talking about by Election Day." If he takes a personal jab at President Obama, though, it had better be "wicked funny" or it will backfire.SEE MORE: Advice for Mitt Romney: 'Go rogue' and 4 other strategies2. He must force Obama to lose his coolObama is winning, so he'll want to play it safe, says Chris Cillizza at The Washington Post. Romney's job is to knock the president off-balance, and "that's not a role Romney has been comfortable with in past debates." That was true once, but Romney's "at his best when his back is to the wall," says Edward Klein at the New York Post. He'll attack just fine, but it's not clear he has "the skill to exploit Obama's reputation for being sensitive to criticism." This whole election may "come down to whether Romney can get under the president's skin with well-aimed barbs and crack Obama's composure."3. He should fact-check the presidentRomney and his allies have been telegraphing that he will use the debate "to turn himself into a one-man truth squad," painting Obama "as someone who can't be trusted to stick to the facts or keep his promises," says Politico's Kevin Robillard. That's the right idea, but it's not as easy as it sounds, says Karl Rove at The Wall Street Journal. Romney "can't take on the role of fact-checker-in-chief," but he "must call out the president" on his serial "untruths" but without calling him a liar — "that's too harsh a word that would backfire." And remember, "a dash of humor is worth its weight in gold."SEE MORE: Janeane from Des Moines: The mockumentary that ensnared Mitt Romney4. The best strategy is attack, attack, attack"The first debate will be almost exclusively on the economy," says Eric Pianin at The Fiscal Times, and that gives Romney his best shot to hammer Obama on the deficit, unemployment, and his failure to "create a more harmonious atmosphere in Washington." Being negative "won't make him more likable," political analyst Larry Sabato tells The Fiscal Times, but that ship has sailed — "it is too late to reengineer Mitt Romney." At this point, "his only real chance to break through in the debates is to be relentless in cataloging Obama's weaknesses and prosecuting his case." Turning this from a choice into a rejection of Obama "is the only conceivable way that he wins, barring divine intervention or an October surprise."5. Romney should talk about himself and his plansChallenging the president and his record is "essential," but it's not enough, says the Hartford Courant's Samburg. "It's time to tell us about Mitt Romney." This may sound "crazy," but Romney needs to "forget that the president is standing six feet away" and tell the voters his story, goals, and ideas. If he can spend the middle third of the debate talking about himself affirmatively, "without constant comparison to the past four years," Romney will "see a jump in the polls."SEE MORE: Are the polls rigged against Mitt Romney?6. Suppress his own ticksThe truth is, neither Romney nor Obama are great debaters, says Alan Schroeder at the New York Daily News. Obama can ramble and come off as smug; Romney can come off as "whiny and self-entitled," and he's "not always at his best in situations that demand spontaneity." But he has to do more than stop himself from offering Obama a $10,000 bet. He needs to watch himself debate, and cut out his verbal ticks. For example, "there is the awkward, mechanical chuckle that Romney emits whenever he is asked an uncomfortable question — presumably his debate coaches have warned him to suppress that urge at all costs." As Al Gore's infamous sigh in 2000 shows, these things matter.Read more political coverage at The Week's 2012 Election Center.SEE MORE: Was Mitt Romney really the GOP's best candidate?View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	4	3	5	3	4	4	3	5	3	3	3	3	2	2	4	3
22	60-hurt-11-arrested-fans-riot-turned-back-151254679	MADRID - Officials say 60 people have been injured and 11 arrested when music fans rioted outside a Madrid theatre after it closed its doors to avoid exceeding its capacity limits.City police said thousands of people had turned up at the venue in the hope of attending a free music event hosted by music television channel MTV on Friday night.Police said that once the theatre was full, scuffles broke out in the street outside and people began throwing bottles. More officers were deployed, including some on horseback, after garbage containers in the neighbourhood were set alight.An emergency service said that no one was badly injured.	2	2	3	3	2	2	1	2	2	1	2	1	1	2	2	4
23	abe-argo-les-mis-jockey-oscar-attention-090802029	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Hollywood is in its usual hazy head space when it comes to the Academy Awards race.The dilemma: Handicapping the players when so many of the potential front-runners have yet to show their game face.Films such as Ben Affleck's "Argo" and Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman's "The Master" already are proven contenders through rapturous reactions from festival crowds or early theatrical audiences. A handful of summer releases have a shot at best-picture slots — but that depends on the movies still to come.Late prospects include Steven Spielberg's "Lincoln," with Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th president; "The King's Speech" director Tom Hooper's "Les Miserables," the musical adaptation of Victor Hugo's classic that features Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway; "The Hurt Locker" director Kathryn Bigelow's "Zero Dark Thirty," chronicling the hunt for Osama bin Laden; and "The Lord of the Rings" creator Peter Jackson's "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," the first in his three-part "Rings" prelude.Jackson's three "Lord of the Rings" films earned best-picture nominations, and the finale won. "The Lord of the Rings" is a heavyweight drama of a fantasy compared to the more playful "Hobbit," which could hurt the new trilogy's chances among Oscar voters, who usually lean toward weightier stories.But since "Lord of the Rings," academy overseers expanded the best-picture category from five nominees to as many as 10 to bring in a broader range of films, including action blockbusters that often get overlooked for awards.A big test plays out this season on that effort to make the Oscars more relevant to mainstream moviegoers. Academy bosses cited the best-picture snub of 2008's critical and commercial sensation "The Dark Knight" as a key example for expanding the category.With reviews nearly as ecstatic as its predecessor's, the Batman finale "The Dark Knight Rises" may have a better shot depending on the number of nominees, which will range from five to 10 based on voting results among the nearly 6,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.Or the film may fall victim to the academy's general distaste for fantastical tales. Comic-book adaptations have been money magnets for Hollywood, yet no superhero saga has managed a best-picture nomination so far."You don't get into the business of making these kinds of films with any thought toward awards," said Christopher Nolan, director of the current Batman franchise. "If that's what's of interest to you, then if you look at the odds, you're far better off making a very different kind of film."The same may hold for this year's biggest hit, the superhero mash-up "The Avengers," which also earned terrific reviews but has little best-picture buzz among Hollywood odds-makers.Even "Avengers" director Joss Whedon avoids thinking about awards possibilities."It would be a lovely thought, but I don't go there in my mind," said Whedon, who was floored when he shared a screenplay Oscar nomination for 1995's "Toy Story." ''When we got nominated for 'Toy Story,' it was like, 'What are you talking about? Is this a prank?' Anything's possible, but if you start to go down that road, you make yourself crazy."A late-summer threesome of film festivals — Venice, Toronto and Telluride — premiered many potential contenders for the Oscars, whose nominations come out Jan. 10, with the ceremony following on Feb. 24.Among festival prospects: "The Master," directed by Paul Thomas Anderson ("There Will Be Blood"), with Phoenix as a combustible World War II veteran who falls under the sway of a cult leader (Hoffman); "Argo," with Affleck starring in and directing a thriller about the rescue of six Americans who evaded the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979; "Anna Karenina," director Joe Wright's fanciful adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's tragic romance, starring Keira Knightley, Jude Law and Aaron Taylor-Johnson; and "Silver Linings Playbook," from director David O. Russell ("The Fighter"), featuring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro in a comic drama about two deeply troubled souls finding romance.Earlier independent releases might creep into the best-picture race, among them the youthful dramas "Moonrise Kingdom" and "Beasts of the Southern Wild." But that depends on the late-comers premiering over the next three months.Along with "Lincoln," ''Les Miserables," ''Zero Dark Thirty" and "The Hobbit," the lineup includes Robert Zemeckis' airline drama "Flight," starring Denzel Washington; the Alfred Hitchcock tale "Hitchcock," with Anthony Hopkins as the filmmaker, Helen Mirren as his wife and Scarlett Johansson as "Psycho" co-star Janet Leigh; Quentin Tarantino's Civil War-era bounty-hunter saga "Django Unchained," featuring Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio; and the shipwreck story "Life of Pi," from director Ang Lee ("Brokeback Mountain").Contenders rarely talk about their prospects, but they do welcome the fun of the Oscars and the attention they bring to the films."I mean, you get to go in a tuxedo and stuff. Blah blah. And you know, if your mother's around, you can take your mother or something," said Bill Murray, a potential best-actor nominee as Franklin Roosevelt in "Hyde Park on the Hudson." ''But the cool thing is that people always say there's Oscar buzz, but Oscar buzz only means people are talking about your movie. Which means more people go see your movie. That's all I care about. I just want people to see it."___Online:http://www.oscars.org	3	4	2	2	4	4	3	3	4	2	4	2	2	2	3	4
24	aclu-asks-supreme-court-reconsider-gene-patenting-case-193652861--finance	(Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union has asked for a second time that the Supreme Court invalidate Myriad Genetics Inc's patents on two genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, the latest salvo in a case with broad consequences for the future of gene-based medicine.The lawsuit against Myriad and the University of Utah Research Foundation, which hold patents that allow the company to control testing for the genes, alleges that the patents are illegal and restrict scientific research and patients' access to medical care.The lawsuit was filed by the ACLU and the Public Patent Foundation on behalf of medical associations, geneticists, patients and breast cancer and women's health groups, the ACLU said on Tuesday.The Supreme Court had sent back the ACLU's previous lawsuit to the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. It asked the appeals court to reconsider an earlier decision upholding the patents in light of a March decision by the high court that rejected a similar case about a patented method for monitoring a patient's blood.However by a 2-1 vote, the appeals court in August again ruled that companies can obtain patents on genes.The Supreme Court is not required to take up the case and will likely first give Myriad a chance to respond before deciding whether to hear the case or let the appeals court ruling stand."In our view, the court of appeals did not fully consider or correctly apply the Supreme Court's most recent and relevant patent law decisions," ACLU attorney Chris Hansen said in a statement.Myriad did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the ACLU action.The genes in question, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can be used to detect risk of breast and ovarian cancer and to help inform treatment options. Women who test positive using Myriad's gene test, called BRACAnalysis, have an 82 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer and a 44 percent higher risk of ovarian cancer in their lifetimes.The patents give Myriad exclusive rights to perform tests on the two genes. The ACLU suit argues that the exclusivity allows Myriad to set the cost of such testing and makes it impossible for women to access tests that provide more comprehensive information about their genes or get a second opinion about their results.It also claims that it prevents researchers from even looking at the genes without first getting permission from Myriad.

25	afghan-inside-attack-kills-2-americans-2-afghans-081438393	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — An Afghan soldier turned his gun on American troops at a checkpoint in the country's east, killing two Americans and two fellow members of Afghanistan's army in a shooting that marked both the continuance of a disturbing trend of insider attacks and the 2,000th US troop death in the long-running war, officials said Sunday.The string of insider attacks is one of the greatest threats to NATO's mission in the country, endangering a partnership key to training up Afghan security forces and withdrawing international troops.Saturday's shooting took place at an Afghan army checkpoint just outside a joint U.S.-Afghan base in Wardak province, said Shahidullah Shahid, a provincial government spokesman. At least two Afghan soldiers died, he said."Initial reports indicate that a misunderstanding happened between Afghan army soldiers and American soldiers," Shahid said. He said investigators had been sent to the site to try to figure out what happened. It was not clear if the assailant was killed.The attack happened about 5 p.m. in Sayd Abad district, Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Zahir Azimi said in an emailed statement. He did not provide further details.NATO forces announced the assault early Sunday morning, saying only that it was "suspected insider attack" and that a NATO service member and civilian contractor were killed.One U.S. official confirmed that the service member killed was American, while another confirmed that the civilian was also American. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the nationality of the dead had not yet been formally announced.Afghan soldiers and policemen — or militants in their uniforms — have gunned down more than 50 foreign troops so far this year, eroding the trust between coalition forces and their Afghan partners. An equal number of Afghan policemen and soldiers also died in these attacks, giving them reason as well to be suspicious of possible infiltrators within their ranks.The attacks are taking a toll on the partnership between international and Afghan forces, prompting the U.S. military to restrict operations with small-sized Afghan units earlier this month.The close contact — with coalition forces working side by side with Afghan troops as advisers, mentors and trainers — is a key part of the U.S. strategy for preparing the Afghans to take the lead in security operations as the U.S. and other nations prepare to pull out their last combat troops at the end of 2014, just 27 months away.The number of American military dead reflects an Associated Press count of those members of the armed services killed inside Afghanistan since the U.S.-led invasion on Oct. 7, 2001.	4	4	4	2	3	2	2	3	3	2	3	1	1	3	3	4
26	africa-stocks-lose-ground-resources-hit-160306604--finance	JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African stocks edged down 0.5 percent on Friday, as investors hit Harmony Gold on the stronger rand and Anglo American Platinum on concerns over labour unrest.Shares of Telkom SA slumped 5.5 percent to 18.30 rand, adding to a similar fall on Thursday when the fixed-line operator warned that first-half profits will likely fall by nearly 65 percent."I think the rand played a key factor here today," said Sasha Naryshkine, analyst at asset manager Vestact."It firmed up and has hurt gold and platinum stocks."The benchmark Top-40 index declined 0.46 percent to 31,934.87. It hit a record high of 32,381.54 last week.The broader All-share index dropped 0.42 percent to 36,206.33. It hit a record high earlier this week.The rand currency rose nearly 1 percent on Friday. A stronger rand is a negative for mining companies, which sell metal for dollars but pay costs in the rand.Harmony Gold tumbled 4.8 percent to 74.41 rand. The bulk of its production comes from South Africa, making Harmony the most sensitive of major gold producers to movements in the currency.Shares of Anglo American Platinum fell 1.8 percent to 440.79 rand. Wildcat strikes continued at four of the company's mines on Friday, with less than 20 percent of the workforce reporting for duty.The world's top platinum producer said in a statement it required all employees to return by the late shift on Monday or face legal action.Shares of African Rainbow Minerals fell 3.5 percent to 167.50 rand after it traded ex-dividend, or without the right to its latest dividend.Trade was active, with 179 million shares changing hands on the bourse.

27	african-mine-labour-strife-halts-slide-chrome-153406061--sector	LONDON (Reuters) - The impact of South African mine labour unrest has spread beyond precious metals to UG2 chrome ore, a by product of platinum and key ingredient in stainless steel, with output cuts putting a floor under prices after four months of decline.In recent months, violent labour unrest over pay has disrupted production at some of the largest South African platinum mines, including those owned by Anglo American Platinum, Lonmin and Aquarius Platinum.South Africa accounts for more than 80 percent of global platinum supply, but it also produces over half of the world's chrome. Both markets are in global surplus, but uncertainty created by production cuts has induced fresh buying.Although disputes at some south African shafts have been resolved, strikes are in full force at others and continuing to spread, raising worries that prolonged disruptions might hit production further.So far strikes have cut output of UG2 chrome ore by about 150,000-250,000 tonnes, market players said, a significant enough amount to have an effect on prices, even in an over supplied market."The strikes in Lonmin have removed about 100,000 tonnes a month of UG2 which is no small amount," said a European ferrochrome trader, adding an additional 50,000-80,000 tonnes have been cut due to strikes at other mines.PRICE FLOORThe reduced output has stemmed a 4-month price decline in ferrochrome - the processed product of chrome, with projections now looking at rising values even though economic slowdown has depressed demand from stainless steel makers, industry players said.Prices of high carbon ferrochrome in Europe stand at around $1.02-1.10 per lb in Europe, with low carbon material selling at between $2.05 and 2.10 per lb.Prices have fallen by around 10 percent in the last four months."There is an output reduction although it is difficult to assess how much; this has already been priced in platinum but not in the chrome and ferrochrome yet," an industry source said."Producers can still rely on stocks for now but these stocks are not been replenished and when the Chinese come back to the market after the National Day holiday next week prices will likely rise especially if the problems in South Africa continue."He estimated that ferrochrome spot prices will move up, pushing the European benchmark price up $0.05-0.10/lb to about $1.20-1.30/lb in the first quarter next year.Adding to supply concerns, works at some chrome mines, including the Xstrata's Kroondal mine and the Samancor Western chrome mine were also briefly suspended earlier this month due to increased protests in the area.In the meantime, South African ANC renegade Julius Malema, who has backed wildcat miners' strikes, said he would visit a platinum mine run by Impala, a large platinum and UG2 chrome ore producer, on Thursday, to press for a wage strike there.BRIEF RESPITEWhile the loss of output is expected to be significant, its effect is likely to be only temporary as platinum miners should quickly make up for the lost supply once operations restart, market players said.UG2 chrome ore, which has a lower chrome content compared to chrome ore, was considered waste by platinum miners until a few years ago.More recently however, technological developments have made it possible to use this by-product as a raw material for stainless steel ingredient ferrochrome and UG2 chrome now makes up for about 50-70 percent of South Africa total chrome ore export, an industry analyst said.Although it is difficult to estimate South Africa's UG2 chrome ore production as stocks figures are not available, domestic consumption and exports stood at 2-3 million tonnes per annum in the last three years.Traders said longer-term plans by firms to process more UG2 chrome from South Africa are likely to put pressure on prices from next year when new capacity is expected to come on stream."That's one of the sources where we could see more material coming from next year and it can have a negative impact on chrome (prices) considering the stainless steel market is still pretty awful at the moment," a second European trader said.	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3	2	4	2	1	2	3	4	4

29	air-force-launching-secretive-x-37b-space-plane-112429990	The U.S. military's hush-hush robotic X-37B space plane is slated to blast off again next month, Air Force officials say. The mission will test the robotic spacecraft's reusability and may eventually land on the Florida runway once used for NASA space shuttles.The X-37B space plane's next mission — called Orbital Test Vehicle-3, or OTV-3, because it is the program's third-ever spaceflight — is scheduled to launch aboard an Atlas 5 rocket from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) sometime in October."Preparations for launch at Cape Canaveral have begun," said Major Tracy Bunko at the Pentagon’s Air Force press desk. "We are on track to launch OTV-3 next month; however, the exact date remains subject to change based on range conditions, weather, etc."A mysterious missionAs with the X-37B program's two previous spaceflights — OTV-1 and OTV-2 — OTV-3's payload and mission details are classified. But the focus remains on testing vehicle capabilities and proving the utility and cost-effectiveness of a reusable spacecraft, Bunko told SPACE.com. [Photos: The X-37B Space Plane]Bunko said in an earlier communiqué that this third flight will use the same X-37B spacecraft that flew the first test flight, the OTV-1 mission, back in 2010.That maiden voyage of the miniature space plane lasted 225 days. It launched into orbit on April 22, 2010, and then landed on Dec. 3 of that year, zooming in on autopilot over the Pacific Ocean and gliding down onto a specially prepared runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.A different X-37B vehicle made a similar Vandenberg touchdown this past June 16, having stayed in orbit for 469 days on its OTV-2 mission.The X-37B program is being run by the U.S. Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. The two space planes — which are 29 feet (8.8 meters) long and 15 feet (4.5 m) wide, with a payload bay about the size of a pickup truck bed — were built by Boeing Government Space Systems.While they're sparing with details about the X-37B program, Air Force officials say the vehicles enable them to test out how new technologies perform in space.“One of the most promising aspects of the X-37B is it enables us to examine a payload system or technology in the environment in which it will perform its mission and inspect them when we bring them back to Earth,” Bunko said. “Returning an experiment via the X-37B OTV enables detailed inspection and significantly better learning than can be achieved by remote telemetry alone.”A new landing site?While both previous X-37B missions touched down at Vandenberg, the Air Force is considering landing future flights at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, next door to the Cape Canaveral launch site.In fact, the Air Force is currently conducting taxi and braking tests as part of an ongoing appraisal. The prospect of a returning the robotic space plane to the KSC landing strip — which was used by NASA's now-retired space shuttle fleet — is seen as a cost-saving measure."We are also considering consolidating landing, refurbishment and launch operations at KSC or CCAFS in an effort to save money," Bunko said.“We are seeking to leverage previous space shuttle investments and are investigating the possibility of using the former shuttle infrastructure for X-37B OTV landing operations," Bunko added. "Those investigations are in an early state, and any specifics will not be known for some time, but could potentially be used as early as for the landing of OTV-3."Leonard David has been reporting on the space industry for more than five decades.

30	al-qaeda-north-africa-making-millions-kidnapping-u-155011734	BERLIN (Reuters) - Islamist militants are increasingly funding themselves through kidnapping, with al Qaeda's north African wing likely to have brought in tens of millions of dollars in ransoms in the past few years, a senior U.S. Treasury official said.The United States estimates militant organizations received $120 million in ransoms over the past decade, including to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in recent years, said David Cohen, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.Kidnapping for ransom was an "urgent threat", particularly in the Sahel, a belt of land spanning nearly a dozen of the world's poorest nations on the Sahara's southern rim, Cohen told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday."It is what has become perhaps the most challenging and fastest growing technique that terrorist organizations, in particular the affiliates of al Qaeda in North Africa and in Yemen, have been using to fund themselves over the last couple of years."Cohen said the average ransom had gone up consistently over the years and was in the range of $5 million per payment."So, it is a growing and really quite urgent threat, particularly in North Africa, in the Sahel and in Mali in particular, where AQIM has now managed to claim dominion over a large territory."AQIM emerged out of Algeria's civil conflict and has expanded south into the Sahara, raising its profile in recent years with hit-and-run attacks and kidnappings of westerners.Militant groups have benefited from lapses in security across the region as countries transition from years of dictatorship to more democratic government.Cohen, on a week-long trip that includes stops in Britain, France, Germany and Italy, said he was talking with other governments in the hope of developing a unified approach to the kidnapping problem.While the U.S. government has a policy of not paying ransoms, some European governments do so.Talks were centered around steps to prevent kidnappings happening in the first place, the handling of hostage situations when they occur, and the tracing of financial flows when ransoms are paid, Cohen said.Iran and Syria were the other main topics of discussion with his European counterparts, he saidSanctions against Syria over the past 18 months had taken a "significant bite" out of the government's finances, he said, declining to give figures. "You have a situation where the Syrian government is spending at a greater rate."They are spending on security needs, on providing subsidies to their citizens, at the same time that the revenue side of the ledger is being significantly restrained. The natural impact of that is that their reserves are depleting."(Editing by Dan Lalor)	4	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	4
31	alaska-militia-member-receives-5-years-prison-term-232337932	FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) — A member of an Alaska militia group was sentenced Monday to five years in federal prison for his conviction on weapons charges in a case involving others convicted of conspiring to kill government officials.Coleman Barney of North Pole held his head in his hands and sniffled loudly while he waited for U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan to impose the sentence Monday in Anchorage."I think you got into some real bad stuff here, and this sentence reflects it," Bryan said.Barney, 38, and two other defendants have been in custody since their March 2011 arrests. The judge said Barney's time already served will count toward his term.Barney was convicted in June of conspiracy to possess unregistered silencers and grenades, and possession of an unregistered 37 mm projectile launcher loaded with a "hornet's nest" anti-personnel round that contained rubber pellets. Bryan's sentence was five years for each of the two charges, with the terms running concurrently.Barney's attorney, Tim Dooley, said he will appeal.Schaeffer Cox, the leader of the Fairbanks-based Alaska Peacemaker Militia, and another militia member, Lonnie Vernon, are scheduled for sentencing Nov. 19 on more serious charges, including conspiracy to commit murder. Members of the tiny militia claimed the group would protect families and property if the federal government collapsed.A jury at the men's trial deadlocked on a murder conspiracy charge against Barney and acquitted him of two other charges: possession of hand-grenade parts that Cox had loaded into Barney's trailer as Cox prepared to move out of Alaska, and a count of carrying firearms during a crime of violence.Before he was sentenced, Barney apologized for making poor choices and decisions. A member of the Mormon church, he said he loved his country and that the militia started out as a group of "wonderful Christian men" who wanted to protect their families in case of a collapse. He said he got caught up in the hype and said things he didn't mean.Barney asked the judge to let him go back to his family."There won't ever be any problems with me," he said. "I'm not a violent man."Prosecutors had sought a 10-year sentence, saying Barney knew about the murder conspiracy, even discussing it at length with Cox and others.Barney was a confidante of Cox and then tried to minimize his actions, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Yvonne Lamoureux. She noted there was no dispute that Barney is a family man and a hard worker, "which makes it all the more difficult to understand how he got to this point."Dooley said prosecutors were trying to sentence Barney for things he wasn't convicted of. He pushed for a sentence of time served or house arrest."Beyond that would be corruption of justice," Dooley said.Authorities have said the men advocated the "241" retaliation plan, which stood for "two-for-one" — killing or kidnapping two officials for any member of Cox' group who might be killed or arrested, an event that never happened. During its investigation, the FBI used an informant to infiltrate the group. He recorded more than 100 hours of conversations.The plot arose after Cox was charged with misdemeanor weapons misconduct. He represented himself at a pretrial hearing, where he rejected the Alaska court system as a legitimate judiciary. Cox said he would not attend another hearing until the court system explained its authority over him.A warrant was issued for his arrest when he failed to appear for trial in that case in February 2011. Until his arrest, Cox went into hiding with his family at Barney's home, prosecutors said.	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	3	3	2	3	1	1	2	3	4
32	alcohol-enemas-frightening-hazing-trend-130600723	The University of Tennessee has suspended a fraternity for 30 days after one of its members was dumped at a hospital with a blood alcohol level of "well over" 0.4 percent, five times the legal limit for driving and clearly within what doctors call the "death zone" for alcohol poisoning. The thing is, the 20-year-old student hadn't been drinking, exactly. According to Knoxville police, he and his Pi Kappa Alpha frat brothers had been giving one another "alcohol enemas." University officials were appalled. "Shock would not be an [overstatement]," says Tim Rogers, vice chancellor of student life. "I myself had never heard of what has been alleged." What are alcohol enemas, and how popular have they become?What, exactly, is an alcohol enema?Unfortunately, it's pretty much what it sounds like: A tube is inserted in the rectum and alcohol is poured directly into the colon. A more colloquial name is "butt chugging." In the Tennessee case, police say they found several bags from boxes of wine scattered around the fraternity, along with several passed-out guys. It isn't, apparently, a pain-free way to get blitzed: The student who was admitted to the hospital was "extremely intoxicated and showed signs of physical and possible sexual assault," the police report says.SEE MORE: Can thermal cameras tell how drunk you are?And this gets you drunk?Yes, and fast. According to the Knoxville police, the frat guys apparently used "rubber tubing inserted into their rectums as a conduit for alcohol, as the abundance of capillaries and blood vessels present [in the area] greatly heightens the level and speed of the alcohol entering the bloodstream as it bypasses the filtering by the liver." That's what makes alcohol enemas so dangerous, gastroenterologist Dr. Preston Stewart tells CNN. Our stomachs and livers use an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase to break down alcohol and make it less toxic, but booze enters the bloodstream unfiltered when it's poured into the gastrointestinal tract.So why not just down shots?Presumably part of the draw is that "you get totally plastered at a much faster rate," says Mary Fischer at The Stir, who says that when she was at the University of Tennessee, "the worst thing anyone ever did was funnel a few beers or partake in a keg stand or two." Boredom or curiosity may also have driven the enema recipients, Dr. Aaron White, at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), tells CNN. "In the past year or so there have been several stories about young people finding unique ways to get alcohol in their bodies," in part because they think it will prevent vomiting and hangovers. But throwing up excess alcohol, he notes, is one way your body keeps you alive.SEE MORE: Disney World starts serving booze: About time?Was this a hazing incident?The UT chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha was cited for hazing in 2008, but the university thinks this was just a high-risk boozing incident. The student isn't new to the university or the fraternity, and hazing is usually associated with pledging. In any case, says Joslyn Gray at Babble, "you don't need a college degree to understand that it's never a good idea to get your party planning tips from a Jackass movie."How common is "butt chugging"?Hard to say; we don't have reliable specific numbers. More generally, about 1,825 college students 18 to 24 die each year from alcohol-related injuries, according to NIAAA figures. It's not uncommon to hear of a new exotic routes to intoxication — besides "butt-chugging," thrill-seekers have been known to insert vodka-soaked tampons into the vagina or anus, or indulge in "vodka eyeballing." And it's not just college students: A Texas man died in 2004 after his wife gave him a sherry enema. Alcohol enemas are "extraordinarily dangerous," says the NIAAA's White, "but people shouldn't get the impression that it's a widespread phenomenon."SEE MORE: How the shape of a beer glass changes your drinking speedSources: Babble, CNN (2), Digital Journal, Knoxville News Sentinel, New York Daily News, The StirView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	4	4	5	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	1	3	4	4
33	alexandra-kogut-murdered-college-student-left-ominous-last-155346923--abc-news-topstories	Even though murdered college freshman Alexandra Kogut was starting college in a different town from her older boyfriend, the two kept in touch with playful Twitter messages anticipating each others' visits.On Sept. 2, Clayton Whittemore, a 21-year-old student at Utica College, tweeted at his girlfriend: " Saturday can't come sooner enough.""So excited for @Whittemore21 to come to Brockport Saturday and bring me half moons," Kogut wrote in September, according to the Utica Observer Dispatch. Her account has since been taken down.But one ominous last Tweet suggests something went wrong during their reunion very early Saturday morning, just hours before Whittemore allegedly beat Kogut to death,"Should've known," she wrote at 12:13 a.m.Prosecutors believe the popular freshman at the State University of New York Brockport campus was murdered early Saturday morning by Clayton Whittemore, 21, who had apparently been visiting for the weekend.Whittemore, of New Hartford, pleaded not guilty to second degree murder charges on Saturday.Authorities said Kogut's mother became concerned when her daughter did not answer her phone and requested campus police perform a welfare check.During that check, campus police found the communication major dead in her room at McLean Hall early Saturday morning.She appeared to have suffered severe trauma to her upper body, said Robert Kehoe of the Brockport Campus Police Department.Authorities caught up with Whittemore, who attends Utica College, at a service station in the town of Dewitt, about 110 miles east of Brockport early Saturday morning."It's tragic when anyone loses their life," Kehoe told ABC News affiliate WHAM-TV. "When a young lady who's a college student and apparently in a safe environment, is brutally murdered as this young lady was, it's certainly a tragedy for her family and friends and the entire Brockport college community."Students and staff were notified of the death via email, social media and a message posted on the school's website.Kogut's family released a statement thanking the community for their support and asking for privacy during their time of grief."Alexandra Kogut was a bright, beautiful young woman who was thrilled to be beginning her college education," the statement said. "Her lovely and sweet demeanor was truly infectious and she will forever be missed."On a "Remembering Alex Kogut" Facebook page, friends pledged to wear purple, the color for domestic violence awareness, today in honor of the freshman.Whittemore remains in the custody of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. He is due back in court for a preliminary hearing Thursday afternoon.	3	3	4	3	3	2	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	4	3	4

36	amazon-seeks-throw-apple-app-store-advertising-claim-003759334--finance	(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has asked a federal judge to throw out Apple Inc's false advertising claim in a lawsuit challenging the online retailer's use of the "app store" name.The claim is part of a March 2011 trademark lawsuit in which Apple, which this year became the world's largest company ever by market value, accused Amazon of misusing its "App Store" name to solicit developers for a mobile software download service.Apple added the trademark claim last November, soon after Amazon announced the launch of the Kindle Fire tablet and, according to the complaint, began to call its app store "Amazon Appstore" rather than "Amazon Appstore for Android." It said this change could have contributed to confusion among consumers.But in a filing on Wednesday with the U.S. District Court in Oakland, California, Amazon said the term "app store" has become so generic that its use could not constitute false advertising.Amazon added that even Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and his predecessor Steve Jobs have used the term to discuss rivals, with Cook having commented on "the number of app stores out there" and Jobs referring to the "four app stores on Android.""Apple presumably does not contend that its past and current CEOs made false statements regarding to those other app stores to thousands of investors in earnings calls," Amazon said."To the contrary, the use of the term 'app store' to refer to stores selling apps is commonplace in the industry."Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, declined to comment.Apple is based in Cupertino, California, and Amazon in Seattle. A hearing on Amazon's motion is scheduled for October 31, and a trial is scheduled for August 19, 2013.The case is Apple Inc v.

37	american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211	HAVANA (Reuters) - Alan Gross, the American government contractor jailed in Cuba for crimes against the state, could be suffering from an untreated cancer, according to an independent review of his medical records, his U.S. lawyer said on Tuesday."Gross has a potentially life-threatening medical problem that has not been adequately evaluated to modern medical standards," U.S.-based radiologist Alan Cohen said in a statement released by Gross attorney Jared Genser.Genser said Cohen had reviewed CT and ultrasound scans performed by Cuban doctors of an unidentified mass behind Gross's right shoulder, which wife Judy Gross cited after a recent visit to her husband.The Cuban physicians diagnosed the mass as a "hematoma" and told Gross in May that it would disappear within a few months, according to Genser.As Gross has lost 105 pounds (47 kg) since his arrest in December 2009, Cohen concluded Gross's right-shoulder mass is in urgent need of proper medical evaluation, including an MRI "and potentially a biopsy, preferably in a facility in the United States, immediately."A "soft tissue mass in an adult who has lost considerable weight must be assumed to represent a malignant tumor unless proven to be benign," said Cohen.The Cuban government had no immediate comment on Cohen's statement, but previously has said Gross was in "normal" health.Gross, jailed in Cuba since December 3, 2009, is serving a 15-year sentence for illegally providing Internet equipment and service to Cuban Jewish groups under a U.S. program promoting political change that the Cuban government considers subversive.His arrest stalled a brief period of progress in U.S.-Cuba relations that have been mostly bad since Cuba's 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power and turned the island communist.The latest doctor's report was seized upon by Genser and Judy Gross, who have been demanding that Cuba allow an independent medical expert to examine Gross."Cuban government doctors are either guilty of gross professional negligence or they are intentionally hiding what could be a lethal condition," Genser said."President Castro, I beg you not to let my husband die on your watch. Your country claims to have such a wonderful health care system - yet why have your doctors misdiagnosed him and failed to order the right tests to determine what is actually happening?" Judy Gross said."Please let us have Alan diagnosed by a doctor of his choosing before it is too late," she said.Cuba prides itself on its medical system, which provides free care to all, but suffers from equipment and medicine shortages the government blames on the long-standing U.S. trade embargo against the communist island.Gross has asked Cuba to let him go home for two weeks to visit his mother and daughter, both of whom have cancer. He has promised to return and serve his sentence, but Cuba has not responded.Cuba has said it proposed talks with the United States about resolving the Gross case but has received no answer. It has hinted at the possibility of a swap of Gross for five Cuban agents imprisoned in the United States, a deal Washington has rejected.It said that Gross could be in a prison but is serving his time in a military hospital.(Reporting By Jeff Franks and David Adams in Miami; editing by Philip Barbara)	2	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	3	5
38	americana-revisited-rockwells-models-reuniting-212815288	ARLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — Don Trachte's cowlick has been tamed. Mary Hall is no longer a towhead. Butch Corbett is still thin, but not the beanpole he once was. And Tom Paquin's carrot top is thinner and grayer.Twenty or so people who were children when they posed in the 1940s for their neighbor Norman Rockwell in the small Vermont town of Arlington are reuniting Saturday to share their memories of the great American artist who once lived in their midst.Rockwell captured scenes of everyday life in his paintings and illustrations for covers of Saturday Evening Post, the Boy Scouts and its publication Boys' Life, art now considered the very definition of Americana. He would pay his neighbors $5 a pop to appear in Hallmark cards, in calendars and on magazine covers that ended up gracing the coffee tables and littering the tree houses of millions of magazine readers young and old."The Saturday Evening Post came out weekly, and we couldn't wait to get it to see what was on the cover," said Hall, who posed for Rockwell four times. "You could always recognize who it was."She appeared as a blond girl wrapped in a quilt and being carried out of a flood by a Boy Scout in an image that became a cover of Boys' Life, and as a teenager in a skirt, white blouse, bobby socks and loafers on a Post cover from 1948. It was called "Christmas Home Coming" and showed people welcoming a boy home from school who's carrying a suitcase full of dirty laundry.An estimated 300 people from the area modeled for Rockwell during his 14 years in the southern Vermont town. Of the 70 or so still living, the oldest is 93 (he can't make it to the reunion). Many still live in and around Arlington.The former models have gotten together before, but this weekend is special. They have been invited to view a new gallery of Rockwell prints and memorabilia that is taking the place of a recently closed Rockwell museum. The new owners are treating them to a turkey lunch presented in the style of Rockwell's famous painting of an excited family gathered for Thanksgiving dinner."I think it's important that the models keep the tradition of the image that Vermont, Arlington in particular, was important in Norman Rockwell's biography. That while he lived in Arlington he did his best work, probably ... and his local models were Arlington people," said James "Buddy" Edgerton, 82, who lived next door to Rockwell, his wife and three sons and modeled for him at least a dozen times.Rockwell was a full-fledged member of the town, attending school basketball games and square dances, and had a great sense of humor, his neighbors recall. But as one of America's foremost artists, he could be as precise as any high-fashion photographer.He would first have the models photographed and then would sketch a drawing. Sometimes the session in his studio took minutes, sometimes several hours. He always had a pipe in his mouth, and he joked around with the kids to make them comfortable."Rockwell had these images in his head, and he wanted you to smile or be wide-eyed in a certain way. You have to be a little actor, you see, and I probably was a little embarrassed," said Trachte, who was 5 or 6 when he posed for a painting of a little boy and girl in pajamas, holding hands and peering up at Santa Claus.Rockwell knew just what he wanted, instructing the children to sit or stand in certain positions with particular expressions and to wear certain clothing, often providing Scout uniforms, or in one case, the velvet outfit that Hall wore for the cover of an edition of the book "Little Lord Fauntleroy.""I find his detail just amazing," said Hall, whose father was a real estate agent who sold Rockwell his first and second home in town.She noted that Rockwell managed to paint the small piece of tape around her leg from a sprained ankle that appeared above her bobby sock: "He didn't miss the details."Edgerton — who went on to write the memoir "The Unknown Rockwell: A Portrait of Two American Families," about a farm boy growing up next door to the Rockwells — modeled for his neighbor at least a dozen times, mostly as a Scout, with his image published in four calendars.The last time he modeled was in 1964, after Rockwell had moved about 65 miles away to Stockbridge, Mass., now home to the Norman Rockwell Museum. Edgerton appeared as a Scoutmaster with his son, then 9, as a Scout in a painting called "Growth of a Leader," showing four profiles of a Scout from a child to an adult with a graying sideburn — much like Edgerton has today."He was wonderful guy," Edgerton said. "He made you feel you were the most important person in the world when you were doing it."___Rathke reported from Montpelier, Vt.	3	5	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	2	3	2	3	1	3

This week, the American Medical Association published what's considered to be the first scientific survey of tattoo removal, detailing which tattoos are hardest to remove (blue ink) and what factors reduce the odds of erasing the damn thing (smoking). The report is a sure sign that tattoos — once the province of rock stars and ne'er-do-wells — have become thoroughly mainstream. Indeed, today not only are tattoo artists enjoying a robust growth-industry, their counterparts — the tattoo-effacement experts — are busily tending to Americans who regret that faded tribal design encircling their biceps or have discovered that the Chinese character on their wrist has an unwelcome meaning.

40	americas-unexpected-addition-386-000-more-jobs-4-110100363	The Labor Department added a new wrinkle to the presidential campaign on Thursday, when it reported that the economy actually added 386,000 more jobs than previously thought from April 2011 to March 2012. President Obama's team welcomed the revised figures, saying they proved "we are making progress" toward recovering "from the worst crisis since the Great Depression." GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney's campaign said the rosier figures don't change anything. "There are 23 million Americans struggling to find work right now," Romney adviser Kevin Madden said, "and the president has nothing more to offer than tax hikes and more regulations." What exactly does the unexpected uptick in employment figures really mean? Here, four significant points to consider:1. We shouldn't be shocked by these revisionsThis doesn't mean companies went "on a previously undetected hiring spree," says Ben Casselman at The Wall Street Journal. "The Labor Department just got access to better data." The feds make monthly estimates based on a survey of 160,000 employers, then, once a year, revise the employment figures based on actual tax records. That's "more accurate — but much less timely."SEE MORE: The surprisingly strong July jobs report: 5 takeaways2. And should treat the monthly jobs reports with a grain of saltPoliticians and economists always pounce when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly jobs report, says Brad Plumer at The Washington Post. But this latest revision "suggests that we could all probably stand" to cool it a bit. Why put so much emphasis on numbers that are "almost never the last word on how the economy’s actually performing"? In 2009, "the economy actually lost 902,000 more jobs than the monthly jobs reports had initially suggested." In 2011, it turns out the jobs reports underestimated the number of jobs being created by an average of 67,000 jobs per month.3. This deprives Romney of a key talking pointThis news is great for America, but terrible for Mitt Romney, says Steve Benen at MSNBC. He probably was looking forward to arguing in next week's debate "that the economy hasn't added any new jobs during Obama's term." That talking point "was always ridiculous," given that employment was already plummeting downward when Obama took office, making it grossly unfair to pin early 2009 job losses on him. Now, though, Romney's "talking point is off the table entirely," because the new figures mean the economy has added a net total of 125,000 jobs on Obama's watch, instead of losing 261,000 as previously estimated. "It also means more jobs were created in Obama's first four years than during George W. Bush's first four years — and Bush didn't inherit a global economic catastrophe."4. But the GOP still has plenty of ammo against ObamaThe fact that the Labor Department just "magically" created a bunch of jobs "changes nothing," says Conn Carroll at The Washington Examiner. The job market today is still "incredibly weak," and it "has gotten weaker the past two months." Not only that, but the employment news was offset by a fresh flurry of scary economic data — durable good orders fell in August by the most since the recession, and second-quarter economic growth was downgraded from 1.7 percent to 1.3 percent. Even with these jobs, "the Obama economy is failing."View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	4	3	4	4	4	3	2	4	4	2	3	3	2	2	4	4

42	analysis-bomb-ticks-eads-pact-politics-cloud-merger-193310637--finance	PARIS (Reuters) - Doubts are growing over the resilience of a Franco-German shareholder pact at the heart of EADS , placing a new timebomb under $45-billion European merger talks with British defense contractor BAE Systems .With firms already racing an October 10 deadline to overcome growing political obstacles, fears over what would happen as core EADS industrial partners seek to disinvest have set the fuse on further discord within months if BAE talks break down.After acting as a power-sharing mechanism for over a decade, the pact which balances national interests via stakes held by the French state, French conglomerate Lagardere and German engineer Daimler will be wound up if EADS and BAE forge the world's largest defense company.But so fragile has the partially confidential pact become, as Lagardere and Daimler prepare to sell stakes to concentrate on core businesses, that there are doubts whether the status quo would hold for more than a year even if the British merger talks fail and EADS tries to return to business as usual.That could promote fresh arguments between French and German politicians over control of one of Europe's strategic companies, without the rights or guarantees the pact now offers."Whether the deal goes ahead or not, the shareholder pact is going to disappear at some point. The rights are fragile and provisional," said a person with knowledge of the safeguards.A spokesman for EADS declined comment.EADS was born from a merger of French, German and Spanish interests in 2000 with a unique structure allowing the Paris government and Daimler to cohabit at arm's length. Daimler owns a voting share of 22.5 percent of EADS. It shares control with Lagardere, which has 7.5 percent but also represents the French government's 15 percent through the 12-year-old share pact.Negotiations to remove the structure and merge with BAE have reached a critical point: France is unwilling to surrender official oversight of EADS, which makes both Airbus airliners and key military hardware; and Berlin has raised the stakes by demanding a state shareholding with equal rights to the French.The situation mirrors a Bastille Day impasse in 1999 when French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin vetoed the creation of EADS without French state shares. Today Germany wants its own role, beyond any influence it may have tried to exert through Daimler.Negotiating in complete secrecy, EADS' founders managed 13 years ago to square the circle with an unusual pact. Its job: to erect a screen between the French state and a skeptical Daimler.A system of boxes surrounding the French government investment left civil servants some powers while giving Daimler and Lagardere final say on key matters like board nominations.It is the vulnerability of these core arrangements - both companies seem keen to cash in their stakes - as much as short-term market or regulatory pressure, that could eventually persuade quarrelling governments and industrialists to cling together to find a way out of the current deadlock."The governments face a dilemma," said a person who has participated directly in similar European-wide negotiations."They can hold onto rights which are provisional and subject to Daimler and Lagardere remaining, or they can exchange these rights against permanent ones enshrined in a special share."Similar to golden shares, the special shares would let Britain, France and Germany block takeovers, replacing another of the current pact's functions in protecting EADS.A350 EXIT SEATIf the BAE deal falls through, shareholders attuned to the next opportunity for structural change will at once set their calendars to the first flight of Europe's newest passenger jet, the Airbus A350, which is scheduled for the middle of 2013.From the time Europe's first carbon jetliner takes off, speculation is likely to swirl around the 7.5-percent stake held by Lagardere, whose chief executive has committed to stay on board EADS only until the risky plane project is finalized.The timing of a sale has been left deliberately vague, with the plane's first delivery not expected until the second half of the following year and market prices certain to play a role.When it does happen, events could cascade quickly inside the pact which is a Russian doll of nested agreements, according to industry specialists and a Reuters analysis of available texts.The first fuse to pop could be a mini-pact applying solely to the French partners, which places a floor on the proportion of the French core stakes to be held by the state and Lagardere.Secondly, a frustrated Daimler has for months been seeking ways to sell some of its shares to the German state without blowing up the very Franco-German pact it helped design; it is unlikely to pass up any chance to sell when Lagardere opts out.After a decade that saw significant birth pangs to the A380 superjumbo, both companies want to focus on core businesses - notably media for Lagardere and vehicle making for Daimler.Even without the first rule, the larger pact would collapse once Daimler fell below a 10-percent holding in EADS unless the French government also were to sell some of its shares, which it has so far refused to do.It is hard to predict what would happen next, but experts say it suggests turbulence for governments, EADS and investors.Without the pact, alternative takeover defences may have to be cobbled together and France would keep a separate veto over matters relating to EADS production of nuclear missiles for the French military. But other special rights for pact members, like helping shape acquisitions or industrial strategy, would vanish, leaving the government with a strake but less clout than before.After a bruising battle over BAE, France and Germany would find themselves badly misaligned, raising doubts over whether Germany would give up its quest for an equal stake. Worse, past divisions have filtered into the company hampering governance.Yet skilful compromise would be needed more than ever to prevent a dash for state shares backfiring, for example by accidentally triggering a mandatory offer for the whole of EADS.With all this at stake, people with knowledge of the pact say a last-minute compromise is likely. But like a hard-fought European bailout to help EADS pay for massive losses on the A400M military plane two years ago, it may not look elegant.As one veteran of past battles in the sector said: "The problem is that everything has been built on a foundation of mistrust between nations that have a problem accepting purely industrial projects and where everyone is seeking guarantees."(Additional reporting by Mark John; Editing by Alastair Macdonald)	3	3	2	4	3	2	2	5	4	4	3	4	2	3	4	3
43	analysis-dow-transports-raise-warning-flag-u-economy-141238214--sector	NEW YORK (Reuters) - A slew of profit warnings from transportation companies like FedEx Corp and Norfolk Southern Corp is raising questions about whether the overall market will end this year on a high note.An enduring part of market lore is the notion that gains in the well-known Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> do not hold unless similar moves in the Dow Jones transportation average <.DJT> "confirm" them. Strategists tend to look askance when they see steady rises in the 30-stock industrial index when the transportation average is not doing well.The idea behind this part of "Dow theory" is that manufacturers as well as the railroads, shippers and trucking companies that move their goods are barometers of the U.S. economy's performance.That makes the recent moves in these averages somewhat ominous. Over the last six months, the Dow industrials have gained 2.9 percent, while the transports have fallen by 5.6 percent.This is not the first time that industrials have rocketed upward while the transports were suggesting caution. Transportation stocks hit a peak in mid-1999 but later started to slip, while the Dow continued to rally through early 2000 before stumbling.In recent months, most railroads and truckers have reported lower shipping volumes as consumers and businesses have worried about the weakening global economy and possible changes in U.S. tax regulations. The resulting profit warnings have pressured transport shares.Until now, stimulus from the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are helping to keep transport stocks from steeper losses, said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont.If the Dow transports, which closed Monday at 4,960.8, fall below a critical level of 4,860 to 4,900, those shares might plunge and pull other stock indices down in sympathy, Mendelsohn said."It might not take much to break those technical levels," which have held for about six months, he warned. "Then hedge fund and money managers are going to pay more attention, and you'll probably see the impact across the broader markets."Another red flag is that analysts have been cutting their third-quarter earnings forecasts at the same time the market is going up.As of Monday, analysts on average expect the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index <.SPX> to report a collective 2.1 percent drop in profit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is in stark contrast with their estimates of a 3.1 percent rise when the quarter began on July 1.To be sure, not all analysts subscribe to the Dow theory that transportation stocks are a leading indicator of the broader markets, now that manufacturing is a smaller part of the overall economy."The Dow theory did a lot better in the 1960s and 1970s, when manufacturing ruled the economy," said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. The Dow transportation average "is not as great a signal in the last couple of decades, when you now have a much more broadly based, diversified economy."GLOOMY FORECASTSU.S. transportation companies are suffering from a host of problems, including China's slowdown, a slump in demand for coal shipped by railroad, Europe's fiscal crisis and high fuel costs.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^See related graphic: http://link.reuters.com/xed82t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>Another factor weighing on transports: Shipping customers are cutting back on spending because of uncertainty about U.S. tax policies.At issue is the "fiscal cliff" - the year-end deadline for about $500 billion in expiring U.S. tax cuts and automatic spending reductions set for next year unless Congress can reach a compromise over lowering the budget deficit.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said a "significant recession" could result from these massive government spending cuts and tax increases.At the same time, Republican nominee Mitt Romney is trying to defeat President Barack Obama, a Democrat, in the November 6 election."For industrials and transports in general, the election and the fiscal cliff are two looming issues that the market is waiting on," said analyst Logan Purk of Edward Jones in St. Louis.Transportation and logistics companies are also worried. At least seven of them - FedEx, Norfolk Southern, UTi Worldwide , Swift Transportation Co , Arkansas Best Corp , XPO Logistics Inc and Werner Enterprises Inc have scaled back their profit forecasts in recent weeks. United Parcel Service Inc led the pack when it cut its outlook in July.Kansas City Southern bucked the trend. Its volume grew almost 8 percent in the quarter as the company relies less on coal than its larger railroad peers and is heavily invested in faster-growing Mexico.LOW HOLIDAY HOPESFedEx and UPS could benefit from a rush to buy holiday gifts, particularly if businesses with low inventory quickly need more goods than they anticipated.Both companies could see a fourth-quarter bounce if consumer demand heats up for new technology products that are typically shipped by premium air freight.But FedEx said that would not be enough to offset demand slowed by a weakening global economy. Although Apple Inc's iPhone 5 is a huge hit, some other technology companies have not yet released their new products.Trucking company Werner Enterprises said in its profit warning that more than half of its 11 top retail customers had lower inventory than a year ago."It's not necessarily just because they see lower demand," said Art Hatfield managing director in equity research at Raymond James in Memphis. "It's because they see concern about fiscal policy and dysfunction out of Washington and what they may mean for demand three or four months down the road."(Additional reporting by David Gaffen; Editing by Patricia Kranz and Lisa Von Ahn)	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	2	3	2	3	2	3	3	4
44	analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has a prescription for controlling soaring costs within the $2.8 trillion U.S. healthcare system, partly by making consumers pay more of their own medical bills.Romney's vow to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul has played prominently in the campaign, even as Romney has offered few details about his alternative.But as he prepares to face Obama in their first presidential debate on Wednesday, Romney is giving a few hints. The former Massachusetts governor's advisers say he would accelerate the use of high-deductible insurance plans that offer lower premiums but require beneficiaries to pay thousands of dollars more in out-of-pocket expenses than they would face under conventional coverage.Romney's overriding aim is to create a much bigger retail market in healthcare, with transparency on pricing and services, more flexible insurance pools and interstate insurance markets.That would allow consumers to choose up front what products and services to buy and from whom, according to the Romney campaign. But consumers would cover most routine medical expenses themselves, including annual check-ups, with assistance from health savings accounts and new tax breaks intended to align the private markets for group and individual insurance that cover more than 160 million people."The result," Romney wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine, "will be patients who can confidently choose the coverage that is right for them, who know and care what healthcare costs."The Romney campaign says its series of changes differ dramatically from Obama's 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which requires most Americans to buy health coverage and seeks to make it easier to do that by creating state-based insurance exchanges. Medicaid, the national program for the poor, would be expanded to accommodate those with low incomes.Romney's approach is a political departure for him.In Massachusetts, he oversaw the passage of comprehensive state healthcare changes that later became the model for "Obamacare," the president's federal program.Romney's role in creating the Massachusetts plan made many conservatives wary of him, and in seeking the Republican nomination for president Romney made a point of rejecting Obama's plan as an illegal overreach by the federal government.Since winning the Republican nomination, however, Romney has said he would support some Obamacare provisions. More recently, Romney has been criticized for describing emergency rooms as a way to cover the uninsured - the type of expensive treatment that programs such as Obamacare and his Massachusetts plan seek to avoid.HOW MUCH IS IT?Romney's new incentive-based strategy also could hold pitfalls for consumers.Analysts say the use of heath savings accounts favors the affluent, while statistics indicate that high-deductible plans can mean big out-of-pocket costs for people with lower wages and little disposable income."It remains a very significant tax shelter, and with all tax shelters, it means a lot to people in high (income) brackets," said Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution.But Romney advisers say the approach strikes at two major contributors to spiraling medical prices: a federal tax exclusion on employer-sponsored health plans and conventional benefit packages that insulate consumers from the true cost of healthcare through co-payments and limited deductibles.The idea would be to provide new tax breaks for consumers who now have employer-sponsored plans, which are exempt from federal income tax. But it's unclear whether those breaks would equal the value of the current tax benefits.Conservative analysts say plans with high deductibles make consumers more responsible because they eliminate co-payments and require the patient to see more of the bill."Healthcare is the only service in the United States that you buy and use without knowing what the price is," said Dr. Scott Atlas, a Romney adviser with Stanford University's Hoover Institution. "If you're paying out of a health savings account, you actually see the bill. It really does reduce prices."But Obama supporters and some independent analysts say the Romney strategy could backfire, leaving consumers with higher costs and tax assistance that favors the more affluent."What he's really talking about is shifting more and more of the cost onto the individual," said Christen Linke Young, Obama campaign associate policy director. "That's what he means when he says 'patient centered.' It's really troubling."HEALTH INFLATION'S ENGINECritics also say the patient-centered approach would do little to help the chronically ill, whose needs account for the lion's share of annual medical costs but who often are unable to change providers or forego expenses.The Romney campaign said people with high medical expenses would still be able to rely on more conventional plans with co-payments and limited deductibles, adding that high-deductible plans can provide catastrophic coverage.Growing numbers of U.S. employers have embraced high-deductible plans in recent years to try to guard against rising costs that outpace growth in the economy, inflation and wages.About 19 percent of Americans with employer-sponsored health coverage now are enrolled in high-deductible plans, up from 4 percent in 2006, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies healthcare trends.Deductibles average about $2,200 for individuals and $4,000 for families, while premium savings for beneficiaries average $350 for an individual and $1,000 for a family, according to Kaiser. Annual out-of-pocket liabilities are capped at about $6,000 for single coverage and $12,000 for family coverage.To help consumers, Romney would enhance the attractiveness of health savings accounts, tax-deferred instruments funded by employer and individual contributions. Options include higher contribution limits and a wider range of covered costs.The Romney camp believes those kinds of changes could shift the $800 billion private health insurance market toward high-deductible plans that health savings accounts support.Employer contributions to health savings accounts now average $600 for individuals and $1,000 for families, according to Kaiser."When you make them easier for people to access, that number gets bigger and bigger. And as that number gets bigger and bigger, the market shifts dramatically," said a Romney campaign official, referring to the higher-deductible plans. "We're on our way. The idea is to continue that trend."A Romney administration also would usher in new tax benefits to help consumers meet their medical bills, possibly including deductions for health expenses and tax credits for those who would not benefit from deductions because they pay little or no income taxes.Those new tax breaks could replace some or all of the current tax code exclusion that exempts employer-sponsored healthcare benefits from federal income taxes. The tax exclusion costs the U.S. Treasury about $100 billion to $200 billion a year in lost revenue."The current tax treatment of health insurance is the engine that fuels our health inflation costs. There are myriad ways of solving that. But until we solve it, we do not have health reform," the Romney campaign official said.(Editing by Michele Gershberg, David Lindsey and Lisa Shumaker)	4	4	3	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	4	3	2	2	4	4

47	antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422	After an enormous iceberg called B-15 broke off from Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf, it released chunks of ice — themselves massive icebergs — that wreaked havoc on emperor penguins that breed to the west.But this doesn't appear to have been the case for a population of Weddell seals whose breeding sites were also in the icebergs' path, new research has found.The calving of the 4,250-square-mile (1,100 square kilometers) B-15 iceberg gave researchers a unique opportunity to examine how living things respond to an extreme event in their environment — in this case, the arrival of the chunks of B-15.Previous research has examined the impact of extreme events on emperor penguins. At one of the penguin breeding sites, collisions between the icebergs and the ice on which the penguins were nesting killed some and forced others to move to less-ideal breeding sites. At another site, an iceberg blocked the penguins' route to the open water where they feed, a research team led by Gerald Kooyman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography reported in 2007. [See Photos of the Weddell Seals]Weddell seals vs. ice chunksIn the latest study, another team looked at how the icebergs affected the seals living in Erebus Bay on the Ross Sea. Scientists have been monitoring the seal population there since 1969, and they honed in on the period from 2001 through 2005, when the remnants of B-15, which calved in 2000, passed through."Here, what we found is a pretty mild effect on the seals," said Thierry Chambert, a doctoral candidate at Montana State University and the lead researcher on the project. "They survived pretty well during the five years of iceberg presence, but their reproduction was lower than usual."Chambert and colleagues focused on female seals, since they are more reliably spotted on the ice than males.They found that in four of the five years in which the icebergs were present, the number of females that showed up at the colony was lower than usual. In addition, the probability that an individual female would be alive the following year did not change, but reproduction rates dropped.In years without icebergs, there is a nearly 70-percent chance a female will give birth to a pup. During the iceberg years, this dropped by about 20 percentage points, down to a 50-percent chance.How seals respondResearchers don't know why the icebergs had the effect on the seals that they did, but they have some hypotheses.The icebergs may have made the seals' breeding sites more difficult to access by altering the terrain of the sea ice. Other work has shown that the icebergs had a negative effect on the amount of tiny, floating plants, called phytoplankton, in the sea. This effect could have rippled up the food chain to the seals, which feed on various fish species and other Antarctic foods. [Album: Stunning Photos of Antarctic Ice]The seals had a few advantages over the penguins. Unlike the emperor penguins, which must traverse the ice to feed, the female seals generally stay put once they haul out at the breeding site. The seals may also have benefitted from being farther from B-15 when it broke off the ice shelf, Chambert said.Chambert and colleagues believe that the drop in reproduction is indicative of seals' strategy for dealing with difficult times. Seals can live up to 30 years, and they breed annually beginning at age 6, meaning if they miss a year or two, they will have a chance again later."This is a long-lived species. Because of that, you expect a strategy that will favor survival over reproduction," he said.By putting off reproduction, the seals can spend more energy on survival. This gives them the chance to breed again when conditions are better.The researchers note the icebergs were only around for a short period. More frequent iceberg calving, such as those predicted as a result of global warming, could have had a more negative effect on the seal population, the researchers write.The research was published today (Sept. 25) in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.Follow LiveScience on Twitter @livescience.

52	apnewsbreak-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-223808521	LOS ANGELES (AP) — The California man behind a crudely produced anti-Islamic video that has inflamed parts of the Middle East was arrested Thursday for violating terms of his probation, authorities said.Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, 55, has been on probation for a 2010 federal check fraud conviction that brought a 21-month prison sentence. Under terms of his probation, he was not to use computers or the Internet for five years without approval from his probation officer.Nakoula was taken into custody Thursday, said U.S. Attorney's spokesman Thomas Mrozek.A U.S. District Court hearing was scheduled for Nakoula on Thursday afternoon. It was closed to media and the public.Protests have erupted around the Middle East over a 14-minute trailer for the film "Innocence of Muslims" that depicts Prophet Muhammad as a womanizer, religious fraud and child molester. Though the trailer was posted to YouTube in July, the violence didn't break out until Sept. 11 and has spread since.Nakoula, a Christian originally from Egypt, went into hiding after he was identified as the man behind the trailer.The full story about Nakoula and the film still isn't known.The movie was made last year by a man who called himself Sam Bacile. After the violence erupted, a man who identified himself as Bacile called media outlets including The Associated Press, took credit for the film and said it was meant to portray the truth about Muhammad and Islam, which he called a cancer.The next day, the AP determined there was no Bacile and linked the identity to Nakoula, a former gas station owner with a drug conviction and a history of using aliases. Federal authorities later confirmed there was no Bacile and that Nakoula was behind the movie.Before going into hiding, Nakoula acknowledged to the AP he was involved with the film, but said he only worked on logistics and management.A film permit listed Media for Christ, a Los Angeles-area charity run by other Egyptian Christians, as the production company. Most of the film was made at the charity's headquarters. Steve Klein, an insurance agent in Hemet and outspoken Muslim critic, has said he was a consultant and promoter for the film.The trailer still can be found on YouTube. The Obama administration asked Google, YouTube's parent, to take down the video but the company has refused, saying it did not violate its content standards.Meantime, a number of actors and workers on the film have come forward to say they were duped. They say they were hired for a film titled "Desert Warrior" and there was no mention of Islam or Muhammad in the script. Those references were dubbed in after filming was completed.Actress Cindy Lee Garcia has sued to get the trailer taken down, saying she was duped.	4	4	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	2	4	1	1	2	4	4
53	apnewsbreak-us-surge-troops-afghanistan-233948316	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Nearly two years after President Barack Obama ordered 33,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan to tamp down the escalating Taliban violence, the last of those surge troops have left the country, U.S. officials said Thursday.The withdrawal, which leaves 68,000 American forces in the warzone, comes as the security transition to Afghan forces is in trouble, threatened by a spike in so-called insider attacks in which Afghan Army and police troops, or insurgents dressed in their uniforms, have been attacking and killing U.S. and NATO forces.And it's called into question the core strategy that relies on NATO troops working shoulder to shoulder with Afghans, training them to take over the security of their own country so the U.S. and its allies can leave at the end of 2014 as planned.The number of U.S. forces there peaked at about 101,000 last year, and they have been coming out slowly over the past several months.The surge was aimed at beating back the Taliban to give the Afghan government and its security forces the time and space to take hold. The key goal was to ensure that the Taliban did not regain a foothold in the country that could allow it once again to become a safe haven for terror groups. And there was hope that Taliban members would be willing to come to the peace table.Military commanders say the war strategy is on track and that they have made broad gains against the Taliban, wresting control of areas where the insurgents once had strong footholds. And U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has characterized the insider attacks as the last gasp of a desperate insurgency.But other top military leaders, including U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are worried about the impact of the attacks on the troops. Dempsey called them a "very serious threat" to the war campaign and has declared that "something has to change."	3	3	2	3	2	3	2	2	3	2	3	3	1	3	3	4
54	aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385	Can you imagine a world where there is no other white meat? If skyrocketing use of the term "aporkalypse" on Twitter is any indication, a recent statement from the United Kingdom's National Pig Association is causing some anxious consumers to do just that.But is the trade group's claim that "a world shortage of pork and bacon next year is now unavoidable" really true?"If you define a shortage as a situation where product cannot be found or where buyers must wait in lines to buy a product, the answer is no," Cindy Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the Des Moines, Iowa-based National Pork Board, told Life's Little Mysteries by email. "But the quantity of pork available to consumers in the U.S. and the rest of the world will decline in 2013, due to high feed costs and significant financial losses by producers."The high feed prices are attributed partly to this year's widespread droughts, which have jacked up corn and soy prices and resulted in half of all U.S. counties being declared disaster areas. Some farmers have tried to cope by feeding candy to livestock.Steve Meyer, a consulting economist to the National Pork Board (whose members are chosen by the U.S. secretary of agriculture), said U.S. pork consumers are likely to see price jumps next year as a result of this year's droughts, as the British trade group claims; however, he says the rise in prices will be slight, and he questions the group's "apocalyptic tone.""There will be less pork, but that's happened before," Meyer told Life's Little Mysteries. "I'd be surprised worldwide if it's more than a 2 or 3 percent decrease on per-capita availability. That number hasn't changed that much in a long time."Meyer notes that global availability of pork has for the most part been on a forward march in recent years. Consumption reached an all-time peak in 2010, at 33.4 pounds (15.1 kilograms) per person, before it decreased to 32.8 pounds (14.8 kg) per person in 2011, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service. That figure is likely to bounce back slightly this year, to 32.94 pounds (14.9 kg), before the economic effects of the drought are fully felt by consumers, according to the USDA.Assuming retail prices do start to reflect the decreasing availability of pork, Meyer says he'd be surprised if they topped $3.75 per pound, or about 25 cents higher than they are now."If we have good weather next year, I think costs will come down and they [pork producers] will be back in a profitable place at least by 2014," he said.Still, the long-term prospects for current global pork consumption habits may not be good.A recent report from the Stockholm International Water Institute found that in the year 2050, the Earth's water supply will be able to sustain the expected world population of 9 billion people only if humans are deriving just 5 percent of their calories from animal-based foods ? meat, eggs and dairy ? instead of the current proportion of 20 percent.Follow Life's Little Mysteries on Twitter @llmysteries.

55	apple-app-store-now-prominently-suggesting-maps-app-193046837	Hot off news of Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook’s public apology for iOS 6′s awful new Maps app, the Cupertino-based company is now going the extra mile to help upset iOS 6 users find mapping alternatives. As discovered by Digital Trends’ Molly McHugh, the App Store home page now has a big icon that says “Find maps for your iPhone.” Users who click on it will find a list of map apps that Apple recommends. Currently at the top of the charts is MotionX GPS Drive, Waze and MapQuest.Cook’s apology and the new maps app section are clear admissions that the integrated iOS Maps app will take some time to fix; it could even be years before Maps begins to approach the quality of more established offerings.Remember, Google’s (GOOG) Maps app didn’t become an all-star overnight — it took seven years for Google Maps to get to what it is today. And Google now has a team of 7,100 employees working in that division alone. Until Google releases a proper standalone Google Maps app for iOS (if it releases one), users who are running iOS 6 will just have to look elsewhere for their mapping needs.This is what users will see after they click on the “Find maps for your iPhone/iPad” button on the App Store:[Via Cult of Mac]ReadGet more from BGR.com: Follow us on Twitter, Facebook	3	2	3	3	2	1	1	2	2	3	2	2	1	1	3	4
56	apple-ceo-apologizes-maps-flaws-recommends-rivals-041424819--sector	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook apologized Friday to customers frustrated with glaring errors in its new Maps service and, in an unusual move for the consumer giant, directed them to rival services such as Google Inc's Maps instead.The rare apology follows Apple's launch of its own mapping service earlier this month, when it began selling the iPhone 5 and rolled out iOS 6, the highly anticipated update to its mobile software platform.Users complained that the new Maps service - based on Dutch navigation equipment and digital map maker TomTom NV's data - contained geographical errors and gaps in information, and that it lacked features that made Google Maps so popular from public transit directions to traffic data and street-view pictures."We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better," Cook said in a letter to customers released on its website, adding that the company "fell short" of its commitment to deliver "the best experience possible to our customers."Unusually, he suggested that customers download rival mapping services available in Apple's App Store while the company improves the product."While we're improving Maps, you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing, MapQuest and Waze, or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web app," he said in the letter.Apple is typically loathe to tout rival services and the contrite apology by Cook is an indication of how Apple is changing under the chief executive who took over last year from co-founder Steve Jobs just before his death. It also took the additional step of prominently displaying the rival services on its Apps Store."It is a bit unusual but at the same time, Tim is keeping Apple's commitment to provide the best user experience for customers," Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said. "A key reason for Apple's success is keeping customers happy so we think this is a good move.""People forget that Google Maps started out inferior to Mapquest and Yahoo Maps," he added.Apple's home-grown Maps feature -- stitched together by acquiring mapping companies and data from many providers including Waze, Intermap, DigitalGlobe and Urban Mapping -- was introduced with much fanfare in June by software chief Scott Forstall. It was billed as one of the key highlights of the updated iOS6 software.But errors and omissions in the maps service quickly emerged after the software was rolled out, ranging from misplaced buildings and mislabelled cities to duplicated geographical features.NEW APPLEThe last time Apple faced such widespread criticism was in 2010, when users complained of signal reception issues on the then-new iPhone 4 model.A defiant Jobs at the time rejected any suggestion the iPhone 4's design was flawed, but offered consumers free phone cases at a rare, 90-minute press conference called to address those complaints.While Apple fixed the issue, Jobs had apologized to users only after he was specifically asked if he was sorry. He also said the issue was shared by all the major manufacturers, naming rivals Research in Motion, Samsung Electronics and HTC Corp.Cook himself played a key role in convincing Jobs to tackle the negative publicity that arose around that issue, something he was initially reluctant to do, according to his biographer."Finally Tim Cook was able to shake him out of his lethargy," Walter Isaacson said in his biography on the late Silicon Valley icon. "He quoted someone as saying that Apple was becoming the new Microsoft, complacent and arrogant. The next day Jobs changed his attitude."It remains to be seen how fast Apple can fix the mapping glitches. Jobs had been in a similar position when he allowed email synchronization software MobileMe to launch in 2008, to deadly reviews. The mercurial CEO took the group to task for it and replaced the group's head. The service is now folded into the iCloud product.Mapping is a complex process that takes a lot of resources and years to perfect, said Marcus Thielking, co-founder of Skobbler, maker of the popular GPS Navigation 2 app, built using the crowdsourced OpenStreetMap platform."It helps a lot if you have great data to start with," he said, adding that it appears that different database were thrown together in building Apple Maps. "They (Apple) can offer incremental updates and that's what they will do."Cook said that more than 100 million iOS devices are using the new Apple Maps and that the more people use Maps, the better it will get. He also offered some hints on why the company decided to remove Google Maps.Apple launched the Google-powered Maps "initially with the first version of iOS" and created a home-grown version of the service as it wanted to provide more features, Cook said."As time progressed, we wanted to provide our customers with even better Maps including features such as turn-by-turn directions, voice integration, Flyover and vector-based maps," he said in the letter.Google provides turn-by-turn navigation on Android-based devices but the popular feature was not available for Apple devices. Apple Maps replaced Google Maps in iOS 6 and the Google service is now only available through a browser.Shares of Apple fell 2 percent to close at $667.10 on Nasdaq.(Editing by Edwin Chan and Richard Chang)	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	1	2	3	4
57	apple-downfall-seen-horizon-142022590	Have reports of Apple’s (AAPL) death been greatly exaggerated? Predicting the inevitable demise of the most successful consumer electronics company in the world is something of a pastime for many news outlets. Every leader eventually falls, of course, but predicting how and when is a sure way to attract attention. And so in Wednesday’s edition of The Wall Street Journal, an opinion piece proudly proclaimed that “TV will be Apple’s undoing.”As noted by Fortune on Thursday, WSJ Columnist Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. believes that Apple is slipping. The Cupertino, California-based company has historically focused on making great products but now, Jenkins opines, Apple is becoming far too focused on strategy. He cites the rejection of Google’s (GOOG) superior Maps app as one example of Apple’s missteps, but the issue will really become apparent when Apple tries to tackle TV.“Apple’s fans imagine the company can do for TV what it did for music: breaking up the existing distribution model. Forget about it,” Jenkins writes. “Television is about to demonstrate the inadequacy of Apple’s own business model.”The columnist believes video content owners are not the same breed as music content owners, with whom Apple has seen much success. “Video-content owners aren’t looking for a savior and ultimately won’t be satisfied with anything less than an open ecosystem accessible by any device,” Jenkins says.He continues, “They’ll have no choice: Content owners already see their business being upended by Netflix and Amazon Instant Video, with an approach adapted to digital ubiquity from the get-go. They also know, if they sit still, their current partners, the cable industry and its analogues, will simply take advantage, as satellite operator DISH is doing with its ad-skipping function that so infuriates the TV networks.”For Apple to succeed in this space, it will apparently “have to focus more on giving its devices superb access to content it doesn’t control and hasn’t approved,” and Jenkins doesn’t think Apple’s top brass is up to the task.“The real test will be for senior management,” he writes. “The time to worry will be if Apple’s quixotic quest for TV leads it to block more realistic solutions that emerge on the open Internet. When Apple admits defeat about TV, that may be the best sign for the company’s future.”Jenkins had previously foreseen the “Microsofting” of Apple when it launched the “junky” iPad 10 years ago. As Fortune notes, Apple has sold more than 100 million iPads since that point in time.[Via Fortune]ReadGet more from BGR.com: Follow us on Twitter, Facebook	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	5	2	4	3	2	3	4

Jeffries analyst Peter Misek predicted 8 million iPhone 5s would be sold, while top Apple analyst Gene Munster put the number between 6-10 million. After seeing the long lines on launch day, Munster settled on 8 million as the number.[More from Mashable: 13 Free iPhone Apps to Make Life Easier]These and other analysts typically pointed out a couple key factors influencing their predictions: buzz for the iPhone 5 had really been building up for about two years, and the fact that Apple rolled out the new iPhone in two more countries than the iPhone 4S. More recently, Apple revealed that it received twice as many pre-orders for the iPhone 5 as it did for the iPhone 4S, further fueling speculation of blockbuster iPhone 5 sales.As it turned out, Apple still ended up having a record-setting launch, but opening weekend sales of the iPhone 5 were only about one million units higher than the opening weekend sales for the iPhone 4S last year. What's more, as Asymco analyst Horace Dediu points out, the iPhone 5 sold at roughly the same rate as the iPhone 4s when you normalize for the number of countries in which the phones were available over opening weekend.The reason for the lower-than-expected sales figures, according to Apple, appears to be limited supply. The company's CEO Tim Cook said Apple sold out of its initial inventory, though it continues to ship iPhone 5s to stores and take orders online.As of publication, Apple's stock had rebounded somewhat and was trading above $690 a share.This story originally published on Mashable here.	3	3	4	3	3	4	3	2	3	4	4	3	2	2	3	4
61	arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745	The Arctic sea ice just hit its lowest extent since measurements began in the 1970s, raising the question of when Arctic summer sea ice will disappear for good.The answer is not yet clear, thanks to the complex variability of the sea ice from year to year. But scientists say that Arctic ice is one area where their computer models seem to underestimate the rate of melt."Sea-ice decline is a good example of one of those areas where the projections are too conservative, i.e. where the observed decline is decades ahead of schedule relative to the model projections," Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist, told LiveScience in an email.Sea ice reached its lowest recorded extent on Sunday, Sept. 16, covering only 1.32 million square miles (3.41 million square kilometers) of ocean and blowing past the previous 2007 record of 1.61 square miles (4.17 million square kilometers), according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Ice extent is measured by the area of ocean that has at least 15 percent ice cover.Unlike icebergs, which break off from glaciers, sea ice forms when ocean water freezes. The loss of the ice will likely exacerbate global warming, as ice cover reflects sunlight away from the Earth, while open ocean absorbs the sun's heat. [10 Crucial Facts About Arctic Sea Ice]Sea ice varies quite a bit each year, said Walt Meier, a research scientist at the NSIDC. Thus, researchers expect to see an overall downward trend in ice cover, but it could bounce back somewhat next year."We wouldn't expect it to keep going down straight off the map, so to speak," Meier said during a press conference Thursday (Sept. 20). "We expect there to be more ups and downs."The most extreme estimates of when Arctic summer ice could vanish peg the time in four or five years, but Meier said those predictions are "very unlikely." Much of the northernmost ice in the Arctic is old and thick, he said, and might be more resistant to melt. If so, summer ice extent could hit a plateau and not disappear for many years."A lot of people talk potentially in the next 20 to 30 years we may become ice-free," Meier said. "That's certainly quite plausible."The loss of ice so far has been dramatic. In 1980, Arctic sea ice covered approximately the same area as the lower 48 U.S. states, minus Oregon and Washington. In 2012, it would barely cover half the country, with everything east of the Mississippi melted off as well as Oregon, Washington, Kansas, Nebraska and North and South Dakota.Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitter @sipappas or LiveScience @livescience.

62	arctic-ice-shrinks-time-low-half-1980-size-175242723	WASHINGTON (AP) — Scientists say the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean shrank to an all-time low this year, smashing old records for the critical climate indicator.The ice cap at the North Pole measured 1.32 million square miles on Sunday. The previous low was 1.61 million square miles in 2007. Records go back to 1979 based on satellite tracking.Ice in the Arctic melts in summer and grows in winter, and it started growing again on Monday. National Snow and Ice Data Center scientist Walt Meier (MY'ur) says man-made global warming has melted more sea ice and made it thinner.Meier says in the 1980s, summer ice would cover an area slightly smaller than the Lower 48 states.

66	attacking-iran-israel-bluffing-111500335	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said this week that Israel's talk of launching a surgical military strike to end Tehran's nuclear program is pure bluff. "While we are fully ready to defend ourselves, we do not take these threats seriously," Ahmadinejad said after arriving in New York for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on President Obama to draw a "red line" that Iran can't cross if it wants to avoid a military confrontation, and at the U.N. on Tuesday, Obama warned Tehran that his administration would "do what we must" to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Netanyahu worries that Iran could be close to building its first nuclear bomb in six or seven months, although the U.S. believes the danger is farther off. Would Israel really attack Iran on its own if it thinks it can't afford to wait any longer?Israel may very well attack Iran: Israel isn't just rattling sabers, David Makovsky, an Israel expert and senior fellow at the Washington Institute, tells National Journal. Netanyahu and Co. are convinced that if Iran goes nuclear, it will use the bomb to try to make good on its threat to wipe Israel off the map. Israeli leaders aren't sure "about American resolve if diplomacy and sanctions fail," and they're "hardwired" to launch a military strike alone if that's what it takes."The path to war with Iran"SEE MORE: 5 reasons Netanyahu is challenging Obama over IranIsrael is bluffing: Israel doesn't really think Iran's nuclear program puts the Jewish state's very existence "in peril," says Patrick J. Buchanan at Human Events. If it did, it wouldn't waste time discussing conventional air strikes when it could "drop a single atom bomb" and destroy Iran's most fortified nuclear sites for good. Plus, the "mullahs are not madmen" who would risk their own nuclear annihilation by attacking Israel, and Netanyahu knows that. He's bluffing to scare Obama into fighting his war for him."Has Obama called Bibi's bluff?"Netanyahu wants U.S. help — but he's dead serious: I'm "skeptical that Israel can go it alone," says Michael Ross at Canada's National Post, but that doesn't mean Netanyahu is bluffing. Iran is a sworn enemy of Israel and the West, and the stakes here are too high to be making idle threats. Netanyahu is just "applying much needed pressure" to make sure the international community does something before it's too late.

The auctioneers verified it as a Renoir and estimated its worth at $75,000 to $100,000.The Baltimore Museum of Art told Potomack on Wednesday that its records indicated "Paysage Bords de Seine," or "Landscape on the Banks of the Seine," was stolen while on loan to the museum in 1951, the auction house said.Potomack told the FBI and a federal probe is under way. There is no known police report on the theft.BOUGHT IN PARISThe Renoir came to the Baltimore museum through one of its leading benefactors, collector Saidie May. Her family bought the painting from the Bernheim-Jeune gallery in Paris in 1926.The Washington Post found records in the museum's library on Tuesday that showed May had lent the paintings and other works to the museum in 1937, Potomack said.After the newspaper told it of the findings, the Baltimore museum checked its files and found a loan record showing the Renoir had been stolen on November 17, 1951. What happened to it after the theft is unknown.Doreen Bolger, the museum director, said the museum's probe into what happened to the painting was in early stages but was centred on May.She died in May 1951 and the art collection was willed to the museum. As its ownership was going through legal transfer, the painting was stolen while still listed as on loan."At this point we just want to make sure that the painting winds up where it belongs and that we provide all the information we can to law enforcement about this issue," Bolger said.Potomack said the painting had not turned up when it checked London's Art Loss Register, a database of stolen and lost art.

69	australians-suddenly-richer-statistician-finds-338-billion-061906320--business	SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australians are suddenly a whole lot better off after the government statistician "found" A$325 billion ($338 billion) in share assets previously unrecognized.The Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday released its latest report on household assets which included massive upward revisions to estimates for equity holdings. Total financial assets were now put at A$3.1 trillion at the end of March, compared to the originally reported A$2.77 trillion.The revision is worth roughly A$14,380 for every one of the country's 22.6 million people."This issue incorporates new estimates for households holding of unlisted shares and other equity in other private non financial corporations," the statistician drily noted.The value of such equity is now put at A$383 billion at the end of March, compared to the original A$91 billion."The Bureau of Statistics has effectively 'found' A$325 billion in household wealth," said Craig James, chief economist at CommSec.Total financial assets also rose further in the second quarter to stand at A$3.11 trillion by the end of June, up A$76 billion on the same period last year.No less than A$702 billion of that was held in bank deposits. Australian banks have been competing fiercely for deposits to reduce their dependence on offshore funding, while households have been keen to save more in the wake of the global financial crisis.Since the end of 2007 the amount of money stashed in bank deposits has climbed by A$260 billion, or almost 60 percent."Australians are continuing their love affair with defensive assets such as cash and bank deposits," said James."And it's not just Aussie consumers, but companies and even superannuation funds," he added. "Pension or superannuation funds have more than 15 percent of funds in cash and deposits - the highest proportion on record."Non-financial companies held A$395 billion in cash and deposits at the end of June, suggesting one reason why lending to businesses has been so sluggish in the last couple of years.The upward revisions to wealth also mean households do not look quite as stretched when compared to their debts.The ABS now estimates the ratio of debt to liquid assets was 129.1 percent in March, well down on the original estimate of 170.1 percent.There have been long-standing concerns that the high debt levels of Australian households left them vulnerable to an economic shock such as a sharp rise in the, currently low, 5.1 percent unemployment rate.(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Kim Coghill)(Wayne.Cole@thomsonreuters.com; 612 9373 1813; Reuters Messaging: wayne.cole.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)	2	3	2	3	4	4	3	2	2	3	2	3	3	2	3	4

71	autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health	Mike Lake describes his autistic son Jaden as a "3- or 4-year-old trapped in a 16-year-old body," a boy unable to speak or comprehend emotions.For Jaden, abstract thinking is a challenge and his most direct communication is reaching for his father's face and crying out "bababa" when he needs to be understood.But that "beautiful simplicity" is enough for his dad."I lay down with him on the bed at night and he looks at me in communication mode," said Lake, 43. "Oftentimes, I just drift into his language ... He talks along with me at the same time bababa-ing. It's the strangest thing. We are not communicating anything concrete, not the world I am living in, but for us it is a connection."Since 2006, Lake's world has been Canada's House of Commons, where he delves into the complex political issues of the day as a member of Parliament and secretary to the minister of industry.But at home with Jaden, he enters a different world where speech doesn't matter as much as unequivocal love."I didn't get elected to Parliament on the autism issue," said Lake, 42. "But as time has gone by, it's one world. It has allowed me a platform to get out there and raise awareness."I decided early on to include him in every opportunity we could and not to hide the family and to use the opportunities over time to share the story of an amazing kid and what life has been like for us."Lake, whose family also includes wife Debbi and 13-year-old Jenay, lives in Edmonton, Alberta. This week, he is in New York City speaking before the fifth annual World Focus on Autism, co-hosted by Autism Speaks and Ban Soon-taek, wife of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The world of autism is still a mystery. And while research has advanced, particularly in the area of genetics, it is still a puzzle to scientists. Some studies show autism strikes as many as 1 in 88 children, mostly boys."When something gets in his mind, he grabs my face in an escalating 'bababa' until he gets the explanation he needs," said Lake. "He is obsessed with dogs and will go nose to nose with any dog and he likes baking chocolate chip cookies and bowling Saturday mornings with Dad. "But for Jaden, who is on the cusp of adulthood, the future presents mind-boggling challenges.He has no sense of danger and will cross the street unaware of the traffic. Once, on the grounds of the House of Commons, he lunged for a German Shepherd security dog, grabbing its neck and going "mouth-to-mouth" with the animal.Though he cannot communicate verbally, Jaden is capable of much that might translate into a future vocation: a 130 score in bowling, a job cataloging books at the library and making chocolate chip cookies."Here is a kid that when you first see him, his skills seem significantly affected, then all of a sudden you see him measuring things out and cooking," said his father.He is also extraordinarily affectionate, not typical in autistic children. In a Canadian television interview with his father, ebullient Jaden is a far cry from Dustin Hoffman's character in the film "Rain Man," a robotic autistic adult."We've spent a lot of time being in his face and making sure we are physical with him and cuddling him," said his father.Each year on April 3, which is World Autism Awareness Day, Lake delivers an impassioned speech before the House of Commons -- a very personal one."Mr. Speaker," he begins. "I never dreamt I'd have a son with special needs. But I can honestly say I couldn't be more proud of my boy. He is always quick with a high-five or a kiss, is never ever a bully, and loves everyone without a hint of judgment. I think we could all use a little more of that."As a politician, Lake encourages "every family in North America" to meet their elected officials and educate them on autism."Bring your loved one with autism, I tell people," he said. "If you can't explain autism because the family member is acting up -- they can explain it better than you ever could."Jaden was diagnosed just before he was 2, but his parents knew there was something wrong before that."He wouldn't respond when calling him and at first we thought he had a hearing problem," said Lake. "Then we realized when he was two floors away and we turned on [the TV show] 'Barney' he came running down.""He was not like a typical kid who once in a while ignores his parents," said Lake. "He would actually come to get us, really as a tool, for something he couldn't reach. He would push our arms up to the shelf in the pantry where the treat was he wanted."But Jaden was clever at other things. He could put foam blocks with letters of the alphabet in order "without hesitation," according to his father.Jaden's grandmother was the first to suspect autism when she read a book written by another mother, "Let Me Hear Your Voice," that described Jaden "perfectly."All those with autism are different. "You have to be an expert at reading your own child," said Lake. "Jaden is unique -- he wants to talk but he can't. Other kids are completely silent."Jaden gets excited about the film, "Sound of Music," Smarties (Canadian M&Ms) and being told concrete plans about the day's schedule. But he cannot articulate his feelings."People with autism have a real hard time, even highly functioning people," said Lake. "And they come across as odd -- and have great difficulty in their social lives."So far, in a K to 12 school where Jaden has gone his whole life, his classmates have embraced him. He has been involved in musical theater, dancing in a production of "Oliver," and this year learning to play an old man, who walks across the stage with a cup.But Jaden is incapable of telling his parents if he has a stomach ache and when his parents ask him, he might give a meaningless nod. "He wants to make us happy with the answer he gives," said Lake. "His default answer is yes."They worry about his future, when they are not around to love and care for him, but hope Jaden can contribute with the skills he does possess."We have chosen to focus on what is in front of us," said Lake, not ruling out living or vocational opportunities "that are good for him."Jaden has had intensive interventions -- about 36 hours a week -- since he was 2. He can use the computer to write down "very basic and concrete" words, but his parents have decided that it's more important to interact with him in other ways than to rely on a speech-activated device.Jaden's mother cried when he learned to kiss for the first time at age 11.Lake, who worked for 11 years for his hometown ice hockey team, the Edmonton Oilers, said his relationship with Jaden surprises him in some ways."I am a very competitive person, so the idea of having a child with special needs would have terrified me," he said. "I had visions of my son playing in the NHL and graduating with honors. I look back and I can't imagine loving a kid more than I love Jaden. And I look back at every milestone and I'm every bit as proud of everything he's done.""I always say that if we could snap our fingers and Jaden wouldn't have autism," said Lake. "We'd miss the Jaden we have now."	2	3	4	3	4	3	2	4	4	2	3	3	3	3	3	3
72	avengers-space-nasa-astronaut-recounts-movie-nights-life-185721771	Now that he's returned to Earth from a five-month stay on the International Space Station, NASA astronaut Joe Acaba is still getting used to life on the ground.Acaba landed in Kazakhstan Sept. 16 after riding a Russian Soyuz spaceship back to Earth with two cosmonauts, Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin. The three spaceflyers had just finished stints as crewmembers on the Expedition 32 mission of the International Space Station, which orbits Earth 240 miles (386 km) overhead."I'm feeling much better, getting used to it, and better and better every day," Acaba told SPACE.com during an interview Wednesday (Sept. 25). "You forget how strong gravity is when you've been gone for a while."During his tenure in space, Acaba had a hectic schedule of science experiments, space station upkeeping duties, and hosting the occasional robotic cargo-delivery spacecraft. In fact, Acaba was present for the very first visit of a privately-built vehicle, the Dragon capsule built by Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) of Hawthorne, Calif., which docked at the space station May 25.Dragon delivered a load of food, clothes and supplies as a trial run for a series of 12 delivery hauls the company is contracted for by NASA."I was pretty fortunate — I arrived and then four days later, Dragon showed up, and so it was a real busy time for my first part of the increment," Acaba said. "It was very nice to be part of that first docking of a commercial vehicle, and we really enjoyed it, and it was a great milestone." [Video: Joe Acaba Encounters 'The Avengers' and Dragon in Space]But it wasn't all work and no play in space. Acaba was the mastermind behind the plan to screen the movie "The Avengers" on the space station while he was there. A self-professed comics fan, the astronaut worked with NASA, Marvel Comics and Disney to uplink the film to the orbiting outpost in June."It's really nice to have a movie night," Acaba said. "As a crew, we're very integrated. Just like here on Earth, whenever you can get together with family and friends to watch a movie or whatever it may be, it's pretty special, so we enjoyed the movie and we just enjoyed spending time together."The astronaut gave the movie high grades."I thought it was great, but I'm a little biased because I enjoy all the superhero movies, growing up with comics and things like that," he said. "I enjoyed it, and I was very thankful that we were able to get it up there."Acaba joined NASA in May 2004, and flew to space for the first time on the STS-119 mission of the shuttle Discovery in March 2009. Before becoming an astronaut, Acaba earned a master's degree in geology, and taught in high school and middle school."I was a math and science teacher out in Florida, and I think the teaching profession really gets you pretty well qualified to become an astronaut," Acaba said. "It may not seem that way, but schoolteachers every day, they're in a stressful environment, every day is different, and you need to cope with a wide range of people and different experiences."Follow Clara Moskowitz on Twitter @ClaraMoskowitz or SPACE.com @Spacedotcom.

73	avian-malaria-spreads-north-interior-alaska-study-001947384	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Malaria is infecting birds as far north as Alaska's interior, and a rapidly warming climate may be the reason the mosquito-borne disease appears to be advancing northward, a new study shows.It is the first time scientists have detected the transmission of avian malaria in local birds at such far-north latitudes anywhere in North America, said the study, published on Wednesday in the scientific journal PLOS One."We now have shown that malaria is being transmitted in Alaska," said Ravinder Sehgal, a San Francisco State University biologist and a lead researcher on the project.While tropical birds that migrate to Alaska in the summer are known to carry the disease, there had never been any documented cases of it spreading to non-migratory Alaska birds or birds newly hatched in Alaska that had not yet flown south, Sehgal said.Longer periods of warm weather in the summer may be allowing the malaria parasite to thrive in Alaska and be transmitted by mosquitoes, Sehgal said."The question was, how far north is it getting, and is it going to get to birds that have never expressed it?" he said.The study notes that temperatures have been increasing in the Arctic at almost twice the average global rate, and that the warming climate has changed vegetation in the far north.The study evaluated blood samples taken last year from birds in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Coldfoot, a community north of the Arctic Circle. The researchers found avian malaria in resident and hatch-year birds in Anchorage and Fairbanks, though not as far north as Coldfoot.Of 676 birds tested, 7.2 percent were found to be infected. Some of the hardest-hit birds were black-capped chickadees, Sehgal said. Of the black-capped chickadees tested in Anchorage, about 30 percent were infected.Further studies are underway to try to determine what type of mosquito might be spreading the disease, Sehgal said.It is unclear what effect avian malaria might have on the Alaska birds. For some species elsewhere, malaria transmissions are devastating, Sehgal said.Penguins, which have no natural defenses against malaria, die when they are infected in zoos, he said. Malaria also has seriously damaged bird populations in Hawaii, where non-native mosquitoes have been introduced to the habitat.But Alaskans need not fear for their health, Sehgal said. The study detected only avian malaria, which is different from the type of malaria that afflicts mammals."Certainly, it is not going to spread to humans," he said.(Editing by Cynthia Johnston and Xavier Briand)	4	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	2	3	1	1	2	3	4
74	bahrain-says-arrested-29-during-protest-friday-093643067	DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain arrested 29 people in the commercial district of the capital Manama on Friday as anti-government protesters marched in the city centre in defiance of a government ban, state media said late on Friday.Bahrain, where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based, has been in political turmoil since a protest movement dominated by majority Shi'ite Muslims erupted in February 2011 demanding the Sunni-led monarchy enact democratic reforms.The demonstration was organized by an opposition group called February 14, said Jasim Husain, one of the leaders of the main opposition group, Wefaq.-It came two weeks after protesters and police clashed in the city centre for the first time since last year, following months of demonstrations in other parts of Manama and elsewhere in the country."Rioters hurled petrol bombs, iron rods and stones, endangering both the police and civilians in the area," the government Information Affairs Authority said in an emailed statement.The government has taken a no-tolerance approach to protests in the city centre, saying unrest in "vital commercial areas" could damage the economy.The statement added that police "used only the necessary force to restore order", that the 29 people arrested would be referred to the public prosecutor. It said there would be an investigation to identify others involved in the protest."People should have the right to stage rallies in the capital. A rally on a Friday afternoon is not a big deal. It will not undermine the economy," said Husain.In Bahrain, the weekend falls on a Friday.The United States urged Bahrain this week to accelerate democratic change and hold talks with the opposition after a meeting in Geneva where Bahrain's Foreign Minister Khalid Bin Ahmed Bin Mohammed Al Khalifa pledged "unprecedented reforms".(Reporting by Angus McDowall in Riyadh; Editing by Rosalind Russell)	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	4	3	1	3	2	1	2	3	4
75	bahraini-protesters-police-clash-funeral-205144404	MANAMA (Reuters) - Bahraini protesters threw petrol bombs and stones on Tuesday at riot police who were trying to disperse them with water cannons after the funeral of a Shi'ite man jailed for his role in last year's pro-democracy uprising, witnesses said.Bahrain's Information Authority said Mohammed Ali Ahmed Mushaima had been in hospital since August, and died of complications from sickle cell disease.But opposition activists accused the authorities of causing the 23-year-old's death by denying him proper treatment."Due to his medical condition, his lawyer had tried more than once ... to ensure adequate medical attention for him, but the prison authorities failed to provide such attention," said Mohammed al-Maskati, head of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights.Mushaima was jailed for seven years in March 2011 for "vandalism, rioting, assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest", one of hundreds of people who were arrested in weeks of mass protests inspired by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt.Despite that crackdown and two months of martial law that followed, clashes between police and protesters still occur almost daily in Bahrain, where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based. On Friday, a 17-year-old died in a confrontation with riot police.The protesters, mainly from the Shi'ite majority, had demanded a bigger role for elected representatives and less power for the ruling al-Khalifa family, who are Sunni Muslims. Some Shi'ite groups sought an end to the monarchy.Shi'ites complain of discrimination in the electoral system, jobs, housing, education and government departments including the police and army. They say government assertions that it is addressing those concerns have produced no action.A commission of international legal experts reported in November that torture had been systematically used on protesters to punish and extract hundreds of confessions. Among its many recommendations were reviewing activists' jail sentences.FUNERALWitnesses said thousands of people, mostly Shi'ites, had gathered for Mushaima's funeral on Tuesday, which passed peacefully.They said clashes erupted afterwards when police stopped hundreds of people trying to march to the Pearl Roundabout, the center of last year's uprising.Separately, activists said six Bahraini medics had been re-arrested on Tuesday, a day after losing appeals against jail terms ranging from one month to five years for their role in the pro-democracy protests.The medics were freed from detention last year after an outcry over allegations of torture.Ali al-Ekry, former senior surgeon at the Salmaniya hospital in Manama, was sentenced in June to five years in jail. Eight other medics received prison sentences ranging from one month to three years, and nine people were acquitted.The charges included inciting hatred and calling for the overthrow of Bahrain's rulers.The World Medical Association, a confederation of 100 national medical associations, said the verdicts were "unacceptable" and urged Bahrain to drop the sentences.Amnesty said it considered the jailed medics prisoners of conscience."Despite the government's claims that the medics committed a criminal offence, Amnesty International believes they have been jailed solely for peacefully exercising their legitimate rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly," said Ann Harrison, program director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.Bahraini officials could not be reached immediately for comment on the cases.The government has denounced the protest movement as sectarian and part of a quest by Shi'ite Iran to dominate the region. Iran denies involvement and Bahraini Shi'ites deny being steered from Tehran.(Writing by Raissa Kasolowsky; Additional reporting by Sami Aboudi; Editing by Kevin Liffey)	2	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	2	1	4	3	
76	bahraini-teenager-killed-fridays-protest-124231095	DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahraini riot police killed a teenager when they fired shotgun pellets during clashes with protesters following a demonstration on Friday, the country's opposition said on Saturday, the second young protester to die in six weeks.Thousands rallied on Friday in an officially authorized protest called by the main opposition group al-Wefaq, but as the event ended around 100 demonstrators clashed with police.Witnesses on Friday said riot police used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse those demonstrators, who, the authorities said, were throwing petrol bombs and wielding iron bars.The police described the incident after the protest as a "terrorist attack" on a security patrol that "targeted the lives of members of the patrol" late on Friday evening.The police had defended themselves "according to their legal authority", a statement said, confirming one of the protesters had died.Bahrain, headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, has been in turmoil since mass demonstrations started at the height of Arab Spring unrest last year, led by its Shi'ite Muslim minority.The protests were put down by the Sunni monarchy which imposed martial law and invited Saudi Arabia to send troops in support.In mid-August a 16-year-old protester was killed in a similar incident, when police opened fire with birdshot during clashes after a demonstration, opposition activists said.The opposition says more than 45 people have been killed in protests since martial law was lifted in June 2011. The Interior Ministry says protesters have injured more than 700 police officers and that the authorities have exercised restraint.Al-Wefaq named the dead protester as 17-year-old Ali Hussain Nima and distributed photographs show a body covered in blood and flecked with birdshot wounds. The pictures could not be independently verified.Bahrain and Saudi Arabia accuse Iran of fomenting the unrest in the island kingdom and among Saudi Arabia's Shi'ite Muslim minority, who mostly live in a province situated next to Bahrain. Iran denies the accusations.The death comes a day after the U.N. Human Rights Council appointed a Bahraini as the Asia representative to its advisory committee.(Reporting By Angus McDowall in Riyadh; Editing by Robin Pomeroy)	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	3	2	3	2	1	3	4	4
77	bailout-no-reform-indias-indebted-power-distributors-071444435--finance	NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is set to offer a bailout to its cash-strapped power distributors that would help restructure more than $35 billion in debt but do little to reform a sector whose dysfunction has exacerbated the country's growth-sapping energy crisis.The country's mostly state-owned distribution utilities are drowning in losses and were blamed for triggering probably the worst blackout in history in July, when power was cut for two consecutive days in a massive area home to 670 million people.The federal cabinet will consider the bailout plan, the second in a decade, when it meets at 5.30 pm (8 a.m. EDT) on Monday, officials said.Shares in some Indian power sector lenders and power producers rose 2-3 percent on hopes that the cabinet would approve the plan, the latest in a series of actions to address structural problems slowing down Asia's third largest economy.A lifeline for power distributors would free up cash and help them buy more power to supply factories and homes that resort to expensive diesel generators and solar panels to plug their energy gaps.Last week, the government cut subsidies on diesel and opened up the country's vast retail sector as well as aviation to foreign investment to win back investor confidence and attack the country's ballooning fiscal deficit.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, defending the measures, said "money does not grow on trees" and that failure to bridge the gap between government spending and income would stoke inflation and lead to further loss of confidence in the economy.Under the rescue plan for power distributors, provincial governments will take on half of their short-term debt and convert them into long-term bonds over the next three years.Lenders, who are mostly government-run banks, will be asked to turn the rest into long-term loans and offer a moratorium on repayment of the principal for three years. But they will not be expected to reduce interest rates on the restructured loans, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, said.HALF MEASURESBut analysts said the bailout plan did not address the country's long-term energy problems and may only drag government lenders deeper into the red."The debt restructuring, as it stands, appears largely a breather as it is not accompanied by any concrete reform measures," said Kameswara Rao, a partner at consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers.With loans to power distributors accounting for 4-7 percent of their respective books, Indian Bank , Union Bank of India , Bank of India , Oriental Bank of Commerce and Canara Bank are among those with the highest exposures, according to a report by Bank of America Merril Lynch.The country's largest lender, State Bank of India , and leading private banks have no exposure to the distributors, according to the report."The restructuring could worsen their (banks') asset liability mismatch," Rao warned. That is because banks will have to wait longer to be paid back, hampering their ability to repay short-term liabilities.Years of populism, corruption and mismanagement have driven power distributors into losses that had accumulated to 926 billion rupees ($17.35 billion) by the end of financial 2010/11.Under political pressure to sell below cost and losing more than a quarter of power supply to theft and decrepit networks, distribution companies have been borrowing for years to fund their losses.Just seven of the country's 28 states - Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh - have between them accumulated short-term debt of 1.9 trillion rupees ($35.6 billion) from power distribution.($1 = 53.36 Rupees)(Additional reporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani)	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	4	2	4	2	2	1	2	4	3

82	because-competing-apple-way-too-easy-samsung-finds-155510313	As if the task of competing with Apple’s (AAPL) new iPhone 5 isn’t daunting enough, Samsung (005930) has chosen an interesting approach to promoting its flagship Galaxy S III smartphone in the U.S. that inadvertently brings a new rival into the mix: Facebook (FB). As dominant as Apple is in the mobile industry — the company accounted for 77% of all mobile industry profits last quarter — Facebook is equally in command of the social space. But nevertheless, Samsung’s recent promotional efforts in the U.S. take aim squarely at one of Facebook’s key features.Samsung’s Galaxy S III has definitely found success in North America thus far. Alongside a recent announcement that the flagship smartphone sold 20 million units in its first 100 days of availability, Samsung noted that it sold 4 million units in North America during that time period. While that figure pales in comparison to Apple’s iPhone sales, the Galaxy S III is just one smartphone in Samsung’s arsenal and 4 million units is nothing to scoff at.The handset’s continued success relies on a number of factors, however. Ongoing support from carriers’ in-store sales staff is always important, but marketing and advertising obviously play a huge role in generating consumer awareness and interest.In Samsung’s most recent ad run for the Galaxy S III, the company focuses on one feature in particular. Dubbed “Share Shot,” the nifty function creates a series of Wi-Fi Direct connections that allow users to instantly and automatically share photos they take with their friends who are nearby. The feature requires a Galaxy S III be used on both sides of the connection — sending photos and receiving photos — but it will be included in additional Samsung phones set to launch later this year.Here is one of Samsung’s recent television commercials showcasing the feature:Share Shot can be a bit tricky to set up at first, but in my tests it worked well on Samsung’s Galaxy S III. All else aside, however, the question remains: Is Share Shot the answer to a question no one is asking?Facebook is currently home to nearly 1 billion active users each month, and photo-sharing is one of the monstrous social network’s key features. Users love sharing photos and, perhaps even more so, they love commenting on each other’s photos. How important is photo-sharing to Facebook users? So important that the company decided to spend nearly $1 billion to acquire Instagram and further bolster its photo-sharing portfolio.Now, whether or not Samsung intended to compete with Facebook, Share Shot is direct competition with Facebook’s photo-sharing features and with Instagram. The problem, however, is that while Share Shot is technologically far more advanced than anything Facebook offers, it is far less social.When users share images via Share Shot, each of their nearby friends (who use a compatible device and who have configured the feature) will instantly receive a copy of each image taken on his or her phone. It has been shared. This means that if the user decides to share a photo later using Facebook or Instagram, it is no longer novel for friends who had previously used Share Shot.Photos shared using Share Shot are also only visible to those users in close proximity to the source phone. No other friends can see these photos unless they are re-shared on a more widely available network. Share Shot also doesn’t support commenting — and we all know how much people love to comment on photos — or re-sharing without the use of a third-party app.In the end, Share Shot is a social feature that isn’t very social at all.Share Shot is by no means a useless feature, though. It is an example of an area where Samsung is trying to add value and differentiation, and for some users, it may indeed be compelling. Samsung’s focus on the feature in recent ads is part of a bigger issue, however: Samsung is not always good at telling people why they should buy Samsung phones.Samsung’s recent iPhone 5 attack ad is another perfect example of this. Going on the offensive and telling people why they should choose the Galaxy S III over the iPhone 5 is a fantastic idea. Listing trivial or unknown features like “Shake To Update” and “Palm Touch Mute Pause” as reasons people should buy the Galaxy S III over the iPhone 5, however, is not.Samsung is doing a great job of building phones that carriers want and that consumers want. It sold more than 50 million smartphones into channels last quarter and it had a formula that was really working. But that formula seemed to involve saturating the market with models of all shapes more than it involved creating strong differentiated experiences.In a recent interview, however, Samsung’s marketing boss pointed out that the company is hoping to change that. “Especially in U.S., people are obsessed with Apple,” Samsung’s Younghee Lee said earlier this year. “It’s time to change people’s attention.”Samsung is moving in the right direction. Its latest flagship phones like the Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II indeed offer unique features that cannot be found elsewhere. Now, finding a way to communicate the right features to the right audience looks like it will be Samsung’s next big challenge if it hopes to see continued success once carriers’ attention begins to shift elsewhere.Get more from BGR.com: Follow us on Twitter, Facebook	2	3	2	4	4	2	2	3	4	2	3	2	3	2	3	
83	beer-flows-germany-kicks-off-oktoberfest-101657502	BERLIN (AP) — The mayor of Munich has tapped the first keg of beer to kick off the 179th traditional German folk festival Oktoberfest.With only two blows of his hammer and a cry of "O'zapft is" — "It's Tapped" — Mayor Christian Ude inserted the first tap into the first keg as the festival opened Saturday.More than six million guests from around the world are expected to descend on the beer tents of Munich to celebrate Oktoberfest through October 7.Last year's visitors consumed almost 8 million 2-pint (1-liter) mugs of beer. This year a mug, called "Mass" in German, sells at up to €9.50 ($12.30).German authorities keep security tight around the fairgrounds which accommodate hundreds of thousands of people at a time, although, they say, no concrete threat exists.	3	4	3	3	2	2	3	2	3	2	4	1	2	1	3	3
84	behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The surreptitious video recording of a fundraiser held for Republican Mitt Romney in May provided a rare glimpse of how he views supporters of President Barack Obama - as government dependents.It also provided an equally novel sight of a relaxed Romney doing an impression of Henry Kissinger, dishing about late-night television talk show host David Letterman, and receiving some pointed tips for his presidential campaign."I saw Dr. Kissinger," Romney says on the video, recounting a meeting in New York with the former U.S. secretary of state. "I said to him, 'How are we perceived around the world?' And he said one word: 'Veak!'"The secretly filmed recording, released in its entirety by the liberal Mother Jones magazine on Tuesday, opened a window on how Romney acts during the kind of private meeting with donors that is helping to propel the most expensive presidential campaign in U.S. history.In this case the former Massachusetts governor and private equity executive was speaking to donors who paid $50,000 each for the privilege of his company at a private dinner at the Boca Raton, Florida, home of financier Marc Leder.Family and friends often say that Romney, who can be awkward while campaigning, is at ease and funny when the cameras are off— or believed to be."You're not eating," Romney scolded one attendee during his remarks at the fundraiser."I'm mesmerized," the donor said."He's bored to tears," Romney said to laughter.At one point, Romney decided to give the donor a lesson in eating."You take this, your fork, and you put it in," Romney said.When asked about Democrats' criticisms of his tenure as a wealthy executive at Bain Capital, Romney pretended to plead poverty."I'm poor as a church mouse," said Romney, who has an estimated fortune of $250 million.NOT UP FOR 'SLAPSTICK'Romney also gossiped about CBS late-night talk show host David Letterman, a frequent critic of the Republican. Romney said he preferred Jay Leno, host of NBC's "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.""Letterman hates me because I've been on Leno more than him. They are very jealous of each other, you know," Romney said.By coincidence, a few hours after the video's release online, Obama arrived in New York City to tape an interview with Letterman.Romney said he turned down an appearance on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" because visiting the show "has the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential."Days before the election in 2008, Republican presidential candidate John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, flew to New York to be on the show.'ISLAMICS DO NOT WANT TO VOTE FOR YOU'At the Florida fundraiser, Romney's comments were captured by a videocamera that had been placed on what appeared to be a marble bar.Waiters wearing white gloves were seen serving the guests red wine from decanters. For most of the video, only the backs of donors' heads can be seen, with Romney in profile.The audio does, however, pick up donors' comments to Romney, including some good-natured ribbing about his image on the campaign trail."They say, 'He's a rich boy,'" one donor affably told Romney during the dinner.The comments reflected donors' anxieties about Romney's perceived deficiencies.One donor complained of the difficulties of converting Obama supporters to Romney's side."Right now I'm very concerned," she said. "Women do not want to vote for you. Islamics, the majority, do not want to vote for you. College students don't.""Why don't you stick up for yourself?" a male donor asked Romney."You have to show your face more on TV," said another.A third donor counselled Romney on the importance of social media.A fourth donor urged Romney to "take the gloves off and talk to the people who actually read the paper."When Romney responded to their reservations by telling the guests about the importance of his three debates against Obama in October, a donor cut him off."You will do so well," the donor said. "Your debates are incredible."(Editing by David Lindsey and Prudence Crowther)	3	3	3	3	2	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	2	3	4
85	behind-social-media-campaigns-obama-romney-104608266	With about five weeks left until the 2012 presidential election, both Democrats and Republicans are kicking their campaigns into high gear.[More from Mashable: Think You Know the JPEG? Think Again]As more potential voters turn to the Internet to stay connected -- and less are catching political TV spots -- the need to leverage social media to hit respective audiences has never been greater. But the payoff could be huge for either party.The force behind the campaign for Republican candidate Mitt Romney includes a digital rapid response department that works alongside the communications team at its Boston headquarters. Romney's digital director, Zac Moffatt -- who oversees all social media initiatives, as well as email and text message marketing, website and online advertising and mobile strategy -- says the campaign is getting ready to ramp up efforts in the days leading up to the election, and social media will play a big part in that.[More from Mashable: Somber French Cat Discusses Political Opinion [VIDEO]]"There is a higher level of expectation for speed than in past elections for getting information out, and the campaigns have to be that much faster, whether it's through mobile or social media sites such as Google+, Facebook and Twitter," Moffatt said. "The Internet is a powerful thing, and not everyone is watching TV spots anymore, so we're trying to use the web to our advantage the best way we can."To manage the flow, the team went from 14 staffers in the primaries to about 120 people. The campaign keeps an eye on social media sentiment and what people are saying, from voters to journalists. About 6 million people are already connecting to Romney's campaign on social media sites."We are always monitoring the online audience, but it's hard to measure success right now," he said. "There are about six million people connected to the campaign on social media sites right now, and we know people are engaged. We need to keep that engagement thriving."To do so, Moffatt said the team is about to work even harder in the days leading up to the debates and Election Day.His day begins at about 7 a.m. with a series of conference calls and meetings that conclude around 9 a.m. The meetings don't pick up again until about 11 a.m. across different states and departments, and then momentum builds throughout the day as projects in need of approval pour in. On a good day, things wrap around 8 p.m."There have been a lot of really late nights," Moffatt said, adding that he's relied on Diet Coke to make it through the sleepiest of times. "Fortunately, I don't have to travel that much -- it's far more time-efficient not to travel and just get work done at the office. Plus, I have a young daughter at home, so I like to be as close as possible to my family."Moffatt said his team has become especially close throughout the entire process, noting that many even went to his wedding: "When you spend so much time doing what you do for work, it's important to have the right people around you," he said.As time rolls closer to Election Day, millions of people will start to visit the website in the next 30 days, coupled with the 6 million people already engaging on Facebook and Twitter, so the team is about to ramp up efforts now more than ever."When we get into the final stage, we will work with state teams for volunteers who do door-knocking and boast up our online strategy about eight times more," Moffatt said. "We are moving into a phase of mobilization where every day is important."But after the election, Moffatt has just one thing on his mind: "Sleep," he said. "I also want to spend more time with my young daughter and my wife."Meanwhile, President Obama's team is also keeping social media top of mind throughout the campaign. Not only is it leveraging his more than 20 million Twitter followers and nearly 29 million Facebook fans -- significantly more than Romney's social media presence -- by sending out registration information and statements about Obama's views, they are also posting articles, tweeting facts about Romney's stances and using it as a platform to respond quickly when needed."As we push through the few weeks of this election, social media is one important way we can keep a conversation going with our supporters and undecided voters across the country about the clear choice Americans face in this election -- between the President's plan to keep moving forward with an economy built on a strong middle class, and Mitt Romney's plan to go back to the same failed policies of the past," Obama spokesperson Adam Fetcher told Mashable.Those behind Obama's social media strategy are clearly sharp and quick, too: It didn’t take long for Obama to react to Clint Eastwood’s “Invisible Obama” routine, which took place at the 2012 Republican National Convention last month and became a meme that spread like wildfire across the Internet.Obama tweeted a picture -- sent from the @BarackObama account, run by his campaign -- of him sitting in a chair marked “the President.” His caption: “This seat’s taken.” Many applauded the campaign's use of social media to respond quickly to what was happening.This seat's taken. OFA.BO/c2gbfi, twitter.com/BarackObama/st…— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) August 31, 2012In addition, Obama received national attention for participating in an "Ask Me Anything" Q&A session on popular site Reddit. It marked a key moment for the blending of politics and Internet culture, with more than 200,000 users viewing the session at one time.Social media is also being blended into other strategies, including mobile. The campaign is using a Dashboard tool for supporters and volunteers, so they can get all of the necessary information to become engaged with the campaign, both online and offline. For example, volunteers making calls through the Dashboard tool can have results uploaded in real time to the exact same system used in the field offices. This eliminates duplication and redundancy, and volunteers can share their progress with others on Facebook and Twitter along the way.Image courtesy of iStockphoto, lisafx; Flickr, Mitt Romney.This story originally published on Mashable here.	4	3	4	3	3	4	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	2	3	3
86	belarus-holds-elections-boycotted-opposition-050852641	MINSK, Belarus (AP) — Belarus is holding parliamentary elections Sunday without the main opposition parties, which boycotted the vote because of complaints over the detention of political prisoners and opportunities for election fraud.The election must fill 110 seats in parliament, which long has been reduced to a rubber stamp by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko's landslide win in 2010 triggered a massive protest that authorities brutally suppressed, and any rallies after the parliamentary vote would be certain to draw a similar harsh response.Lukashenko has ruled the ex-Soviet nation of 10 million people with an iron fist since 1994. Western observers have criticized all recent elections in Belarus as undemocratic.The U.S. and EU have imposed economic and travel sanctions on Lukashenko's government over its crackdown on opposition groups and independent media.	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	4	3	2	3	2	1	2	3	4

88	bernanke-makes-strong-defense-fed-rate-policies-163042949--finance	WASHINGTON (AP) — Chairman Ben Bernanke offered a sharp defense Monday of the Federal Reserve's bold policies to stimulate the weak economy, while cautioning Congress to respect its private discussions.The Fed needs to drive down borrowing rates low because the economy isn't growing fast enough to reduce high unemployment, Bernanke said in a speech to the Indiana Economics Club. The unemployment rate is 8.1 percent.Low rates could help lower the federal budget deficit by reducing the government's borrowing costs and generating more tax revenue through stronger growth, Bernanke said.Bernanke also cautioned Congress against changing the law so it could review the Fed's interest-rate policy discussions. Such a step would improperly inject political pressure into those talks and make Fed policymakers less likely to act, Bernanke warns.The speech comes just weeks after the Fed voted at its Sept. 12-13 meeting to purchase mortgage bonds to help boost the housing market. The Fed left the program open ended, saying that it would keep buying the bonds until the job market showed substantial improvement.The Fed also said at the September meeting it plans to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero through at least mid-2015.Bernanke spoke two days before President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney will hold a debate in which the economy is a central theme. And his speech comes four days before the government releases its September job figures. Economists expect just modest hiring gains and continued unemployment above 8 percent.The U.S. economy is struggling more than three years after the Great Recession ended. High unemployment and weak pay growth has made consumers more cautious about spending, which has hurt manufacturing and slowed broader growth.The Fed is hoping to make home buying more attractive to help the broader economy. When home prices rise, people typically feel wealthier and spend more. Consumer spending drives nearly 70 percent of economic activity.	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	3	4
89	beta-blockers-may-not-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes-194600103--abc-news-health	New research suggests that beta-blocker pills don't prevent heart attacks, strokes or cardiac deaths in patients with heart disease, but doctors are torn over whether there's enough in the study to make them want to stop prescribing the drugs. Beta blockers have been a standard heart medication for decades.The study, published in the Journal of American Medical Association, looked at nearly 45,000 patients with prior heart attacks, coronary artery disease or risk factors for coronary artery disease, and found that those on beta blockers didn't show significantly lower rates of heart attack, stroke or cardiac death than those not on the medication."This is a very compelling study that has the potential to shake up the conventional wisdom that exists regarding the role of beta blockers in the management of patients with cardiovascular disease," said Dr. Randal Thomas, a cardiovascular specialist at the Mayo Clinic. "At a minimum, it will lead to new studies that address this issue once again."Beta blockers work by blocking adrenalin receptors in the brain that become activated when the body is stressed. Beta blockers are used to treat heart disease, high blood pressure, anxiety and other conditions.Some doctors say they are glad beta blockers are being questioned because their use had been "written in stone" for so many years, but others say using a non-randomized data sample is not as reliable as a randomized drug trial.While the authors attempted to account for differences between the patient groups that might have had an impact on their health, they did not have access to information on why some patients were prescribed these drugs and some were not, said Dr. Richard Besser, the chief heath and medical editor at ABC News.Dr. Melvin Rubenfire, who directs cardiovascular medicine at the University of Michigan, said he'd been hoping for a study like this, but it won't change his prescribing habits because he uses beta blockers only in specific cases. Rubenfire also weans patients off the pills 18 months after they have a heart attack if they experience adverse side effects, such as fatigue and erectile dysfunction.Rubenfire said the existing data wasn't enough to determine which patients would benefit from beta blockers, and what kinds of beta blockers are better than others. Beta blockers include at least six brand names, including Sectral, Tenormin and Zebeta.Even study coauthor Christopher Cannon, a professor at Harvard Medical School, said he will continue to prescribe beta blockers to his patients, adding "I would not make too much of this" because the study is only observational."All it can do is raise up an idea for us researchers to consider for further study," he said.Cannon said this research shows that it's unclear whether beta blockers add more benefit than the other therapies developed in the decades since beta blockers became a standard of practice for treating patients with heart disease. Since patients are often taking several drugs, it's hard to pinpoint how much one agent helps compared with another.Dr. Steven Nissen, who chairs the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, said the medicine might not be ideal for all of the patients it's prescribed to, but a new randomized, controlled trial will be necessary to change guidelines for prescribing beta blockers."Abandonment of this type of therapy for post-MI [post-heart attack] patients based upon an observational study is not warranted," he said.For the time being, the study raises questions, said Dr. Harlan Kumhulz, a professor of medicine, epidemiology and public health at Yale University."The question it raises is about how long after having a heart attack should patients remain on beta blockers?" Kumhulz said, noting that beta-blocker patients didn't have better outcomes than the other patients did after the first year. "The study cannot definitively answer that question -- but raises doubts about the need to continue to take them for the rest of a patient's life."Dr. Lauren Hughes of the ABC News Medical Unit contributed to this report.	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	4	4

You’re asking for trouble.The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to people who buy their prescription dugs online: buyer beware. Many online pharmacies are fake, the agency says, selling medications that may make you sick.“Buying medicines from rogue online pharmacies can be risky because they may sell fake, expired, contaminated, not approved by FDA, or otherwise unsafe products that are dangerous to patients,” FDA commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg, said in a news release. “Fraudulent and illegal online pharmacies often offer deeply discounted products.”Bottom line: if prices for prescription meds sound too good to be true, they probably are.MORE: Counterfeit Medications Thwart Global Efforts to Treat Dangerous DiseasesAlmost 25 percent of people who shop on the Internet have bought prescription drugs online, the FDA says. And 30 percent of those people said they weren’t sure about how to safely purchase medication that way.They’ll need to come up to speed quickly, since the National Association of Board of Pharmacy says that less than 3 percent of online pharmacies are in line with federal and state laws.While the FDA didn’t say if online prescription drug shopping has increased, some other recent statistics may shed some light on the issue.

92	biogens-hemophilia-drug-meets-stage-trial-goal-142412674--sector	(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc said on Wednesday its experimental treatment for patients with Hemophilia B, a rare inherited blood disorder that impairs blood coagulation, met the main goal of controlling bleeding in a late-stage trial.A single injection of the long-lasting clotting factor, being developed in partnership with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, controlled bleeding in 90.4 percent of all bleeding episodes.Biogen, whose shares rose as much as 2.7 percent initially, said it plans to submit an approval application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first half of 2013.The study, known as B-LONG, enrolled 123 male patients age 12 and older, divided into four groups that were treated at different intervals. Overall, 93.5 percent of patients completed the study.The companies said the treatment was generally well tolerated, but one serious side effect was reported. The most common side effects were nasopharyngitis, influenza, joint pain, upper respiratory infection, hypertension and headache.They said they expect to file an application with European health authorities after completion of a study in children younger than 12 years old, as required by the European Medicines Agency.Hemophilia B is one of two forms of the disease, affecting about 4,000 people in the United States and some 25,000 worldwide. The company is also testing a drug for Hemophilia A, a more common form of the disease that affects about 16,000 people in the United States and 400,000 worldwide. It expects to present results from the hemophilia A trial by the end of the year.Hemophilia B is caused by a lack, or insufficient amount, of the blood coagulation factor IX protein, needed for normal blood clotting. Patients with hemophilia A lack or have reduced levels of coagulation factor VIII.There are currently multiple hemophilia treatments on the market, but they must generally be given multiple times per week by infusion. Hemophiliacs, including children, are taught to inject themselves in a burdensome process that involves finding a vein and sticking a butterfly needle into it.Current treatments for hemophilia B generate about $1 billion a year, according to Biogen, while the market for hemophilia A is worth about $5 billion.Biogen's products are designed to cut the number of infusions needed to control bleeding. Existing Factor VIII products must be taken as many as three to four times a week. Factor IX products must be taken intravenously two or three times a week.The B-LONG trial showed that patients taking Biogen's drug needed to inject themselves only once every two weeks, an improvement that Geoff Meacham, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said could be "game changing" based on physician feedback.However, Meacham said that while the data is encouraging, "hemophilia is a new disease area for Biogen, so there is some commercial risk associated with the potential launch."Biogen is a leader in the field of multiple sclerosis. It already sells the injectible drugs Avonex and Tysabri and expects to introduce an oral drug, currently known as BG-12, shortly.The company's shares rose 1.9 percent, or $3.05, to $155.89 in mid-morning trading on Nasdaq.(Additional reporting by Esha Dey in Bangalore and Debra Sherman in Chicago; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	4	3	2	2	2	3	4

Earlier, the firm projected the S&P would finish the year at 1,350 and rise to 1,400 by mid-2013.BlackRock provided the targets to Reuters, which is releasing its broad global equity poll on Wednesday.The firm had assets under management of about $3.56 trillion on June 30, including $297 billion in equities under management.At midday Tuesday, the S&P 500 was down just marginally at around 1,455, just above where BlackRock says it will finish the year, but 4.8 percent below its target for the middle of next year.The new targets are the first from Leavy, who took over in June from Bob Doll, the firm's chief equity strategist.

94	bodies-moved-kenya-mass-graves-police-suspect-102953458	MOMBASA (Reuters) - Bodies may have been moved from mass graves in Kenya to prevent an investigation into a suspected slaughter of villagers during inter-tribal unrest in the Tana River region, police said.The suspected graves were found on Monday in Kilelengwani village, the focus of fighting in the coastal area that has killed more than 100 people in the past three weeks, including nine police officers.The scale of the unrest has left many Kenyans convinced it was politically instigated and has raised fears of serious tribal fighting before elections due in March.The Kenya Red Cross said at least 20 people believed to have been killed were still unaccounted for, and they suspected their bodies had been buried in the graves.Regional police chief Aggrey Adoli said only a human foot and human skin had been found after two hours of digging, however."The whole place appeared freshly dug and was exuding the stench of rotten flesh ... we all were surprised when nothing was found. Those who removed the bodies must have been striving to hide some evidence," he said by telephone late on Thursday."It is possible that the graves might have been tampered with and bodies removed before police arrived at the scene to seal it off," Adoli said.Raiders shot, hacked and burnt to death 38 people last week in Kilelengwani and 20 people have been arrested and charged with murder over the killings. Those arrested include members of both rival tribes involved in clashes, the Pokomo and Orma.Local human rights groups have blamed the violence on incitement by politicians seeking to drive away elements of the local population they believe will vote for their opponents.President Mwai Kibaki imposed a curfew last week and sent extra security forces to the area to try to end the violence, intensified by an influx of weapons in the last few years.Settled Pokomo farmers and semi-nomadic Orma tribesmen have clashed for years over access to grazing, farmland and water in the coastal region. Dams along the Tana River, Kenya's longest, supply about two thirds of the east African state's electricity.(Editing by James Macharia and Pravin Char)	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	3	3	2	3	1	1	4	4	4
95	boes-fisher-scheme-boost-credit-supply-060223544--business	LONDON (Reuters) - A Bank of England scheme to give lenders cheap funding will boost credit supply to the recession-hit economy as the majority of Britain's big banks have signed up, central banker Paul Fisher said on Tuesday.The rate-setter also sounded a note of cautious optimism about the European Central Bank's recent steps to calm the euro zone debt crisis, though he urged European governments to use the opportunity to find a lasting fix to the crisis, which the BoE sees as one of the main drags on the British economy.Britain's government and central bank started the new scheme in August, hoping to remove one of the obstacles to economic recovery by offering cheap funds to lower banks' funding costs."I am confident that the FLS (Funding for Lending Scheme) will help the supply of credit," Fisher said in a speech. "Before its introduction, it was more likely than not that the stock of credit would contract further over the next 18 months."Fisher said that 13 lenders had signed up for the scheme, representing 73 percent of the stock of lending to households and companies, as of the end of June. A significant number of other institutions were close to signing up too, he added.Under the scheme, banks and building societies can borrow up to 5 percent of their stock of existing lending from the BoE, plus any expansion of its lending during the period between the end of June and the end of 2013.With some 1.2 trillion pounds of lending to firms and households on their books, the banks currently participating could tap a total of around 60 billion pounds in cheap funds, compared to some 80 billion if all banks took part.It may take banks a while to fully review their lending plans, and drawings on the scheme will likely be spread out over the full time frame to the end of 2013, Fisher said. The BoE will provide details about banks' use of the scheme on December 3.Fisher said five of Britain's six largest banks had signed up for the scheme. HSBC said right at the start it did not want to participate as it preferred to fund lending through customer deposits.CALMER MARKETSA lack of credit is one of the obstacles to recovery for the economy, which has been slowly moving out of recession over recent months.Some BoE policymakers have indicated that they believe the funding for lending scheme could be a better way to get a recovery going than further purchases of government bonds with newly created money.Most economists still expect another dose of quantitative easing asset buys once the current 50 billion-pound round is completed in November."Should the FLS succeed in boosting aggregate demand, then pressure on the MPC to relax policy will wane," Barclays analyst Chris Crowe said in a note.However, Crowe was sceptical about the overall impact of the scheme. "We do not think that banks will substantially relax lending standards to promote new lending," he said.Previous schemes to spur lending since the financial crisis have failed to give a clear boost to the economy. The government has also launched a state-backed business bank to provide more loans to smaller companies.The British Bankers' Association (BBA) said that lending to consumers and businesses fell again on the year in August."Over time, the Funding for Lending Scheme will improve lending conditions, though it is too early to measure any impact yet," the BBA said, adding that the weakness in the economy may well be the reason why companies were reluctant to borrow.The BoE has said the cost of loans and tighter credit conditions are a major reason for the lack of lending, blaming the euro zone debt crisis for a rise in banks' funding costs.The ECB's recent decision to buy bonds from countries like Italy and Spain had improved market sentiment, Fisher said."I would caution, however, that we have been here before," he said. "Along with every other market participant I hope that this time will be different."Politicians now had to use the time provided by the central bank's action to take the necessary steps such as improving the competitiveness of southern European countries, he said.(Additional reporting by Olesya Dmitracova)	3	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	4

98	bonnie-clyde-guns-stay-together-high-bidder-pays-222627603	LITTLETON, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Two pistols found on the bodies of famed Depression-era outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow after they were killed by a posse in 1934 have sold at auction on Sunday for 311,900 pounds.A snub-nosed .38 special found taped to the inside of Parker's thigh with white medical tape fetched $264,000 (163,376 pounds) at an auction in Nashua, New Hampshire. A Colt .45 recovered from the waistband of Barrow's pants was purchased for $240,000.The guns owned by Parker, who died at age 23, and Barrow, who was 25, were purchased by a Texas collector who wished to remain anonymous."They're still iconic and their love story kind of resonates," said Bobby Livingston, vice president of RR Auction, the company that conducted the sale. "We have a romanticized vision of Bonnie and Clyde."The hunt for the outlaw lovers captured the nation's imagination during the depths of the Great Depression. The duo were believed to have committed 13 murders and numerous bank robberies, kidnappings and car thefts during a cross-country crime spree from 1932 to 1934. Their fame was heightened by their practice of leaving glamorous photos of themselves at crime scenes, including one of Parker smoking a cigar.A popular 1967 movie, "Bonnie and Clyde," a somewhat romanticized account of the couple's career starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, was critically acclaimed for its frank presentation of sex and violence.Among other crimes, the two are thought to have killed police officers in Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma. They were also suspected of staging a prison break in Waldo, Texas, that left two prison guards dead in 1934.A posse of Texas Rangers and Louisiana police killed the two in an early morning ambush in northern Louisiana in May of that year.The guns auctioned off came from the estate of memorabilia collector Robert Davis, who had purchased them in 1986 for about $50,000 each, Livingston said.A gold pocket watch found on Barrow's body sold for $36,000. Other items included a 1921 Morgan silver dollar taken from Barrow's jacket fetched $32,400, and one of Parker's silk stockings, taken from the couple's car after their death, which went for $11,400.(Editing by Barbara Goldberg and Philip Barbara)	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	3	2	2	3	2	2	3		4
99	bp-spill-settlement-talks-stall-u-demands-18-130459854--finance	LONDON (Reuters) - Talks between BP and the U.S. government over a settlement for the 2010 oil spill have stalled because the U.S. is insisting that the British oil giant pay at least $18 billion, British newspaper the Sunday Times reported.A settlement deal may not happen until early next year, the newspaper quoted sources close to the company as saying.A settlement between $18 billion to $21 billion is near the level which BP would be required to pay should it be found grossly negligent under the Clean Water Act, said the paper.BP, which declined to comment on the story, has always denied any liability for the United States' worst offshore environmental disaster.Reports in July suggested that the U.S. was looking for a settlement of $25 billion.The newspaper said that BP's board is split over whether to pay $18 billion or continue to push for a settlement at $15 billion, the level it is widely reported to be hoping to settle at.(Reporting by Sarah Young; editing by Patrick Graham)	3	5	4	4	3	5	4	3	3	3	4	1	1	2	4	4
100	bradley-mickelson-become-ryder-cup-rock-stars-200326976--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - The Ryder Cup has seen many great partnerships but never one quite like Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley, who have turned a May-September bromance into golf's dynamic duo.Bradley, a fiery rookie and Mickelson, the most experienced member of the American brigade making his ninth appearance at the biennial competition, have developed the type of chemistry rarely seen on a U.S. Ryder Cup team.With three wins from three matches at stately Medinah Country Club, Mickelson and Bradley have become Ryder Cup rock stars whipping the massive galleries into a frenzy with every high-five and fist-pump.Europe has produced the Ryder Cup's most memorable and enduring partnerships with the pairing of Spanish giants Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal at the top of the list.Olazabal, Europe's captain at Medinah and Ballesteros, who died of brain cancer a year ago but remains the inspirational touchstone for Europeans, formed an almost unbeatable partnership, producing an astonishing 11 wins and two halves from 15 matches.Britons Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood managed six victories out of nine matches and Scotsman Colin Montgomerie and German Bernhard Langer five wins from seven.But the U.S. has never really come close to developing an iconic partnership, Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson were the most successful American pairing, manufacturing five wins from five matches while Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson were 4-0 together."Well, certainly not on the American side," Mickelson told reporters when asked if the Americans had ever had two players so invested in each other."The European side has had some great team mates with Seve and Ollie and some others but to be able to share this experience with Keegan and to partake in his great play and experience the Ryder Cup together has been really awesome."Bradley made a dazzling Ryder Cup debut on Friday, dropping the clinching putt in a 4&3 win over Briton Luke Donald and Spaniard Sergio Garcia in the foursomes.Mickelson had the honors in the afternoon fourball landing a pinpoint tee shot at the 17th that ended the match with a handshake and world number one Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell conceding a 2&1 defeat.Bradley and Mickelson then flexed their muscles in Saturday's foursomes with a record equaling 7&6 thrashing of Britons Lee Westwood and Donald to the thundering approval of the pro-American crowd.Their margin of victory matched the wins earned by Hale Irwin and Tom Kite over Ken Brown and Des Smyth at the 1979 Ryder Cup, and by Paul Azinger and Mark O'Meara over Nick Faldo and David Gilford in 1991.With the U.S. up 8-4, captain Davis Love III decided to give his lead pair a rest from Saturday afternoon's fourball matches to have them fresh for Sunday's singles."Phil gets his break this afternoon and he was asking for his break," said Love. "After all that great golf, he wanted his break because he knows how important tomorrow is going to be."The thing about it is historically and mathematically the guys that have played five matches have not done as well in the singles and we want to make sure we're rested and focused."With 40 PGA Tour wins, including four majors, Mickelson has always been rated as one of the game's best but has never found anyone capable of bringing out his creativity in Ryder Cup competition, which was reflected in his 11-17-6 record coming into Medinah.But in Bradley, Mickelson has found a partner who can pull the best out in his game."I felt young and it felt great," said Mickelson. "I love playing with Keegan. (Editing by Julian Linden)	4	3	4	3	4	2	2	3	3	3	2	2	3	1	3	4
101	bradley-mickelson-win-2nd-match-us-4-2-222554105--golf	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) — Keegan Bradley couldn't have done much better in his Ryder Cup debut, winning both his matches with Phil Mickelson on Friday.Bradley and Mickelson's 2-and-1 victory over Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell, Europe's top team, gave the Americans a 4-2 lead, with two fourball matches left. Earlier, Bradley and Mickelson beat Sergio Garcia and Luke Donald, handing both the Europeans their first loss in foursomes.It is the first time Mickelson has won two matches in a day in Ryder Cup play. The pairing was so successful, Bradley joked that he wished they could play another 36 holes.Europe appeared poised for a big day in the morning, leading all four matches at one point. But Bradley's clutch putt swung the momentum in favor of the Americans. They finished the first session tied with the Europeans, then dominated the fourball matches.Bubba Watson and Webb Simspon made 10 birdies on their way to a 5-and-4 victory over Paul Lawrie and Peter Hanson, and Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar had a multi-hole lead over Justin Rose and Martin Kaymer.The only source of trouble was Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker — again.	4	4	4	3	3	2	3	2	2	4	3	1	2	1	3	4

103	brent-crude-slips-below-112-global-worries-weigh-060409174--finance	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Brent crude fell below $112 per barrel on Monday, reflecting investor concerns a shaky global economy may hurt oil demand following fresh evidence of weakness in China and Japan as well as persistent worries about the debt-saddled euro zone.The drop, also fueled by a stronger dollar, comes after the crude benchmark closed out the third quarter with its biggest three-month gain in 1-1/2 years, buoyed by supply risks in the Middle East and efforts among global central banks to stimulate flagging economies.But manufacturing data out of China that offered more evidence of a seventh straight quarter of slowing economic growth in the world's No. 2 oil user put demand prospects back in doubt. Japan's Tankan survey, which pointed to a worsening mood among businessmen, added to the sour tone."Investors are focusing on demand indicators being weaker than expected," said Natalie Rampono, a commodity strategist with ANZ in Melbourne.China's weak manufacturing activity, Japan's Tankan survey and social unrest in debt-hit Spain "point to downside pressure in the near term" for oil prices, Rampono said.Front month Brent futures fell 79 cents to $111.60 per barrel by 0556 GMT, while U.S. crude futures dropped 64 cents to $91.55.Brent gained 14.9 percent in the third quarter, following a steep drop of 20 percent in the second quarter, while U.S. crude rose 8.5 percent in the quarter after having slumped 17.5 percent in April-June.After a choppy September, helped largely by a series of stimulus announcements by central banks in the United States and Japan as well as a bond-buying plan by the European Central Bank, investors have begun to worry that the measures may only increase liquidity in markets and not spur real demand.WEAK DATAAn official survey of factory managers in China remained in contractionary territory for a second successive month in September despite improving slightly from a nine-month low in August, as the world's second-biggest economy struggles against cooling exports, factory output and fixed asset investment."The overall implication of the China PMI is moderately negative, suggesting Chinese manufacturers are still cutting production and reducing inventories, in light of the weak demand (especially domestic demand)," Citigroup economists said in a report after the data.In Japan, the world's No. 3 oil consumer, the business mood worsened in the three months to September and will stay gloomy, the central bank's tankan survey showed.Uncertainty about Spain's bailout also weakened sentiment across commodities, equities and the euro.Banks in Spain, which has replaced Greece, Ireland and Portugal as the main threat to the single currency, will require about 59.3 billion euros ($76.29 billion) of extra capital to beef up their strength.The ECB will hold a policymakers meeting on Thursday and traders will be closely watching ECB chief Mario Draghi's comments."Eurozone uncertainty, however, remains front and center," said Jason Schenker, President of Prestige Economics in Texas.Draghi's comments "might not make the problem go away, but they might alleviate some concerns of investors."TENSIONS SUPPORTDespite the wobbly economic picture, Middle East supply risks should help limit losses in oil as continued saber-rattling by Iran and Israel keep investors on the edge.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at last week's U.N. general assembly in New York, hinted that his country may take military action against Iran, a day after Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad predicted that Israel would be "eliminated."The comments prompted the U.N. on Friday to urge all sides in the dispute over Iran's nuclear program to tone down "shrill war talk"."The ongoing dispute between the West and Iran on nuclear program of the latter is still the number one risk for oil prices," analysts at consultancy Global Risk Management said in a report."While the situation has not made headlines in the past couple of weeks, the dispute is most certainly still alive."A Reuters survey showed on Friday that output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries fell in September to the lowest since January, led by a drop in exports from Angola, Nigeria and in supply from Iran.Still, investors will remain bearish until there are clear signs of an economic turnaround, as indicated by a drop in net long positions by money managers in U.S. crude oil.They cut their positions to 199,215 contracts in the week to September 25, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.(Editing by Manolo Serapio Jr. and Clarence Fernandez)(ramya.venugopal@thomsonreuters.com; +65 6870 3826; Reuters Messaging: ramya.venugopal.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)	3	3	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	2	2	1	1	2	3	4
104	brent-holds-above-112-demand-worries-ease-iran-063434868--finance	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Brent crude held above $112 on Friday as plans for economic reform in Spain eased investor concerns about Europe's fiscal crisis and revived hopes of a recovery in oil demand growth, with Middle East supply worries also providing support.Asian shares, base metals and gold all gained as Spain announced a budget for 2013 based mostly on spending cuts that could be an effort to pre-empt the likely conditions of an international bailout.But some see Spain as just one of many obstacles to be overcome by policymakers with the overall outlook for the region still bleak, possibly limiting further gains in oil.Brent had climbed 36 cents to $112.37 a barrel by 0550 GMT, and is set to post a weekly gain of 0.8 percent compared with a 4.4 percent fall the week before. U.S. crude rose 46 cents to $92.31 and may slip 0.6 percent for the week."The euro zone crisis may have overcome one hurdle - Spain - but the overall situation is far from having a long term solution," said Victor Shum, managing director for downstream energy consulting at IHS Purvin & Gertz."But the supply risks in the Middle East and geopolitical worries are giving oil added support."Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu drew a "red line" for Iran's nuclear programme on Thursday despite a U.S. refusal to set an ultimatum, saying Tehran will be on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon in less than a year."Escalating Middle East tensions as major UN leaders met in New York also buoyed the geopolitical risk premium, as market participants anticipate potential supply disruptions from Iran," analysts at ANZ said in a note."Some market participants suggested that the tone from ... Netanyahu could take a more aggressive stance toward Iran's nuclear programme."Spain, beset by anti-austerity protests and threats of secession, slashed ministry budgets by 8.9 percent for next year and kept public sector wages frozen for a third year as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy resists market and diplomatic pressure to apply for a rescue.Investors are viewing the cuts as a step in the right direction in at least preparing the country to meet conditions of the European Central Bank to buy their bonds."While the budget result from Spain was undoubtedly a step in the right direction, we are still far from reaching the ‘End Game' on the entire euro zone saga," Tim Waterer, senior trader at CMC Markets, said in a report."Investor spirits may be buoyed momentarily but the budget result could soon be forgotten if Spanish yields start escalating again."QUARTERLY GAINSBrent futures are set to post their biggest quarterly gain in 1-1/2 years due to the tensions in the Middle East and as central banks initiated new measures to boost growth.The European contract is set to gain 15 percent compared with a 20 percent drop in the previous three months. The U.S. contract on track to advance 9 percent, the highest since the three months ended December 31, 2011.Exports from Iran plunged during the quarter as a European Union ban on insuring tankers carrying the OPEC's members crude came into effect from July 1, throwing trade into disarray as the West provides cover for most of the world's shipping fleet.On the demand front, the U.S. Federal Reserve initiated a third round of measures to revive growth in the world's biggest economy.Yet, the outlook for oil is weak as demand growth concerns persist and investors worry that measures announced by central banks may not help in boosting the economic outlook, Shum said.Shum expects Brent to fall below $100 and the U.S. contract below $90 by the end of the year as top oil exporter Saudi Arabia raises output to cool prices in a market weighed by a weak demand outlook."The market will become increasingly bearish if the focus shifts to fundamentals," he said. "The Saudis have indicated they want to keep prices around $100."	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	2	2	3	3
105	brightest-star-explosion-history-reveals-lonely-supernova-182229553	The brightest exploding star ever seen with the naked eye in recorded history apparently experienced a quick and lonely death, a new study reveals.The discovery, which centered on a star explosion witnessed in the year 1006, suggests that many similar outbursts leave no companion star to accompany their demise.The most powerful exploding stars in the universeare supernovas, which are bright enough to momentarily outshine their entire galaxies. One type of star explosion, known as a Type 1a supernova, occurs when one star pours enough fuel onto a dying companion star known as a white dwarf to trigger an extraordinary nuclear explosion.The new study centered its sights on the supernova SN 1006, which was seen all over Earth in the spring of 1006 above the southern horizon of the night sky, in the constellation Lupus, just south of Scorpio. At its peak, researchers say the supernova, which exploded about 7,100 light-years away, was about one-quarter the brightness of the moon, luminous enough that people could have read by its light at midnight. [Video: How to Make a Supernova]Explosive deaths of starsOur sun and more than 90 percent of all stars in our galaxy will one day end up as white dwarfs, which are made up of their dim, fading cores.There are two ways Type 1a supernovas are born — the slow way, which involves a living star dumping gas onto a white dwarf, and the fast way, where two white dwarves merge catastrophically. The slow route would leave the white dwarf's companion behind, while the fast one would effectively blast away discernible traces of either white dwarf.Whether slow origins of Type 1a supernovas were more commonplace than fast ones or vice versa remained a puzzle. Knowing more about the causes behind these explosions is essential because Type 1a supernovas are key to gauging the rate at which the universe is expanding, which in turn could shed light on why this expansion is apparently accelerating due to a mysterious force called dark energy.Scientists have tried looking for companion stars of Type 1a supernovas before. One possible instance was Tycho's supernova, SN 1572, one of the few supernovas visible to the naked eye in historical records, although that case remains questioned.Now a fruitless search for a companion star to the brightest supernova ever seen with the naked eye on Earth suggests this explosion took the fast route.Brightest supernova post mortemUsing data from the Paranal Observatory in Chile, the researchers combed through the space 16.5 light-years in diameter around SN 1006 and "do not find any star in the surroundings of the supernova remnant to be the possible companion of the progenitor of SN 1006," lead study author Jonay González Hernández, an astrophysicist at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands in Spain, told SPACE.com.When combined with previous results, these findings suggest less than 20 percent of Type 1a supernovas apparently occur via the slow route.The scientists detailed their findings in the Sept. 27 issue of the journal Nature.Follow SPACE.com on Twitter @Spacedotcom.

106	britney-spears-camp-livid-over-glee-episode-212641645	Many Britney Spears fans were shocked by Thursday's "Glee" episode after the show gave the superstar's pop hits a second go -- this time dredging up Britney's past tribulations, including her 2007 head-shaving incident and umbrella attack on the paparazzi.And it wasn't just Britney supporters who were angered.PLAY IT NOW: Glee Bashes Britney SpearsSpeaking to Access Hollywood's Billy Bush on Friday, Britney's manager said the singer's team was completely unaware "Glee" was going to revisit Britney's troubled times and was "livid" over the episode.In addition to the one-scene ode to bald Britney, the inflammatory ep (dubbed "Britney 2.0") also recreated the pop princess' much-maligned "Gimme More" performance at the 2007 MTV VMAs, where the singer was criticized for everything ranging from less-than-six-pack abs, to poorly hidden hair extensions, to sloppy, low-energy dance moves.VIEW THE PHOTOS: Glee: Season 4 — The Cast ShotsIn the "Glee" episode, Brittany S. Pierce (played by Heather Morris) -- depressed over having to repeat her senior year of high school and missing her best friend/sometimes lover Santana -- was chosen to lead the Glee Club's pep assembly performance.Donning a costume similar to Britney's 2007 black two-piece ensemble, the show's Brittany meandered lazily through a half-hearted performance of "Gimme More," while lip-syncing and chowing down on a large bag of cheese puffs.Why "Glee" would choose to rehash Britney's low points now that she's made a triumphant comeback struck many as odd (if not mean-spirited), especially since the singer herself helped to boost the series' ratings by appearing on an episode of the show in Season 2.VIEW THE PHOTOS: Pop Princess Britney SpearsAdding insult to injury, "Britney 2.0" aired directly after the superstar's new show, "The X Factor" on FOX.VOTE: 'Glee's' Britney Episode -- Funny Or Not Funny?VIEW THE PHOTOS: ‘Glee’: The Celebrity Guest StarsIn "Glee's" defense, the episode wasn't entirely negative.In the end, Brittany started to make a comeback and said she wanted to be like Britney because "no matter what happened to her, she just came back stronger."-- Erin O'SullivanCopyright 2012 by NBC Universal, Inc.

107	bskyb-warner-bros-sign-uk-film-deal-160459202	LONDON (Reuters) - BSkyB has signed a deal for the right to screen new Warner Bros films on Sky Movies channels and video-on-demand services, tightening its grip on British pay-TV little more than a month after a regulator cleared it of unfairly dominating the British market.Under the deal, announced on Wednesday and spanning five years, subscribers to Sky Movies and customers of NOW TV, an internet service powered by Sky, will have access to Warner releases about six months after they end their cinema runs.The films, including blockbusters such as Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and Batman sequel The Dark Knight Rises, will then be available exclusively on Sky Movies for more than a year. Customers will also have access to older Warner Bros titles, such as The Matrix franchise and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.The deal means that Sky continues to enjoy exclusive UK rights to new releases from all six major Hollywood studios. Rivals complain that the satellite broadcaster's dominance of the British market restricts competition and leads to higher prices.Last month the Competition Commission ruled that BSkyB's position in movies did not adversely affect Britain's pay-TV retail market, saying that new arrivals Lovefilm and Netflix had increased customer choice.Some commentators are expecting Netflix to tryto sign up one of the big Hollywood studios to help it to build its business in Britain.(Reporting by Mike Collett-White; Editing by David Goodman)	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	3	3	2	3	1	2	2	3	4
108	buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280	BERLIN (AP) — An ancient Buddhist statue that a Nazi expedition brought back from Tibet shortly before World War II was carved from a meteorite that crashed on Earth thousands of years ago.What sounds like an Indiana Jones movie plot appears to have actually taken place, according to European researchers publishing in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science this month.Elmar Buchner of the University of Stuttgart said Thursday the statue was brought to Germany by the Schaefer expedition. The Nazi-backed venture set out for Tibet in 1938 in part to trace the origins of the Aryan race — a cornerstone of the Nazis' racist ideology.The existence of the 10.6-kilogram (23.4-pound) statue, known as "iron man," was only revealed in 2007 when its owner died and it came up for auction, Buchner told The Associated Press.German and Austrian scientists were able to get permission from its new owner, who wasn't disclosed, to conduct a chemical analysis that shows the statue came from the Chinga meteorite, which crashed in the area of what is now the Russian and Mongolian border around 15,000 years ago.The meteorite was officially discovered in 1913, but Buchner said the statue could be 1,000 years old and represent a Buddhist god called Vaisravana.The Nazis were probably attracted to it by a left-facing swastika symbol on its front. The swastika has been used by various cultures throughout the ages, but the Nazis tried to appropriate it as the symbol of their ideology, going so far as to put a right-facing version of it on their red and white flag.Scientists not involved in the study told the AP that the research linking the statue to the meteorite was credible."Looks like a solid piece of geochemical 'forensic' work," said Qing-Zhu Yin, a researcher in geology at the University of California, Davis. "No terrestrial artifact would generally contain that much nickel content. Chemical elements don't lie."Rhian Jones, an associate professor at the University of New Mexico who specializes in meteorites, said the claim appeared conclusive."There is a clear and convincing argument that the meteorite the statue is made from is the Chinga iron meteorite," she said.But Yin cast doubt on the claim that the statue represented a Buddhist deity."I am not a historian. But the 'iron man' does not look like a Buddha to me from my cultural background," he said. "It looks more like a warrior with a sword ... (a) resemblance of Genghis Khan. ... I have never seen a Buddha with a sword or knife."	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	3	3	2	3	1	2	1	4	4
109	business-groups-protest-calif-carbon-market-200423671	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Dozens of people, some wearing red "Save Our Jobs" T-shirts, packed a public meeting on Thursday to testify that a key component of California's landmark greenhouse gas emissions law will impose enormous costs on them and consumers.Manufacturers, oil refiners and others appeared before the California Air Resources Board to protest the state's pending cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions. The program's fees amount to a $1 billion-a-year tax increase at a time when the state's economy is sputtering, they said."We are concerned that out-of-state refiners will have an unfair advantage because they are not being held responsible for their emissions," said Lisa Bowman, a Phillips 66 worker and member of United Steelworkers Local 675.The California Chamber of Commerce and others wrote Gov. Jerry Brown urging him to halt the start of the program, which begins in earnest on Nov. 14 and is the central element of California's 2006 climate-change law, AB32.A key issue for those opposed to the program is costs associated with the permits — called allowances — which the program will require businesses to buy, some at auction.In general, cap-and-trade will place a limit, or cap, of the emissions of heat-trapping gases that are allowed from pollution producers like refineries and cement manufacturers. The businesses will be required to buy these allowances from the state, with each permit allowing for a specified amount of greenhouse gases each year.For the first two years of the program, businesses will receive 90 percent of their allowances for free, with the free amount and the cap declining over time.The chamber and other businesses want the amount of free allowances increased to reduce the impact on their businesses in a struggling economy."The fact is that this auction represents a multi-billion dollar hidden tax that will harm California businesses and consumers by dramatically increasing energy costs at a time we can least afford it," the letter to the governor stated.Business groups say the uncertainty about what costs associated with cap-and-trade will be in 2015 — when the number of free allowances are set to be reduced — are influencing investment decisions being made now. They want assurance that those costs will be lowered by offering more free allowances."We need to send the message now ... that more allowances will be available to industry," said Dorothy Rothrock of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. "2015 is right around the corner and manufacturers are making plans this year for the next three-to-five years and capital investments may or may not happen in California based on the current regulations."The board has designed the system to financially reward businesses that reduce emissions below their cap — meaning money could be made through cap and trade.Companies that cut emissions and have extra allowances can then sell the permits in a marketplace; greenhouse gas emitters could purchase those allowances if they failed to cut emissions.Polluters that reduce emissions could turn a profit if the market price for extra allowances rises above the initial cost of the permit."This system rewards those that are more efficient and allows those who can't or don't want to reduce their emissions too keep on operating and pass the cost of allowances on to their customers," Mary Nichols, the board's chairman, said.A company can also meet up to 8 percent of its emissions reduction obligations by purchasing carbon "offsets," or investments in forestry or other projects that reduce greenhouse gases.The program, the largest in the U.S., is modeled on similar programs in Europe, and designed to be able to link up with plans in other states and elsewhere to increase the size of its market for carbon allowance trading."(The board) has gone a long way to make these regulations as simple and palatable as possible," Nichols said. "At this point it's time for CMTA and WSPA and the chamber to join the many of hundreds of businesses that are investing in the fight against climate change instead of fighting AB32."	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	3	3	4
110	cabrera-homer-helps-tigers-close-white-sox-044904950--mlb	(Reuters) - Miguel Cabrera continued his bid for baseball's rare triple crown and helped the Detroit Tigers close the gap on the Chicago White Sox in the American League Central with a 6-2 victory over Oakland on Wednesday.Ace pitcher Justin Verlander tossed six scoreless innings to make it an easy night at home for the Tigers (79-69) as they pulled within two games of first place Chicago (81-67), who lost 3-0 at Kansas City.Cabrera's bid to become the first man to lead the league in batting, home runs and RBIs since Boston's Carl Yastrzemski in 1967 is becoming a gripping subplot to the league-wide race for the playoffs.The Venezuelan infielder, already pacing the AL in hitting (.333) and RBIs (130), blasted his 41st home run to put him one behind leader Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers with just 14 games remaining."It's amazing," Cabrera told reporters. "I feel very good right now, I'm trying to see my pitches and go out there and battle. (But) we have to focus on winning games right now."In New York, the Yankees restored a one-game lead over Baltimore in the AL East when they beat Toronto 4-2 and 2-1 to sweep the Blue Jays in a doubleheader.The Orioles had caught the Yankees with a dramatic 18-inning win in Seattle in the early hours of Wednesday morning and will try to trim the deficit again in another late game against the Mariners.In the National League, Washington and the Los Angeles Dodgers split a pair of games. The Nationals took the early game 3-1 while the Dodgers bounced back to win the nightcap 7-6 behind a ninth-inning home run from Matt Kemp.The win helped the Dodgers (77-72) stay just two games out of the second Wild Card spot held by St. Louis (79-70).Despite the defeat in the second game, Washington (90-58) hold a five-game lead in the NL East over Atlanta, moving closer to their first playoff berth since the franchise moved to the capital in 2005.The Braves (86-64) too appear headed for the playoffs after their 3-0 victory over Miami kept them 6 1/2 games ahead in the top Wild Card position.(Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles, editing by Nick Mulvenney)	2	2	3	3	3	2	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	
111	calculate-2013-facebook-ad-spend-free-tool-090331761	Aiming to take some of the mystery out of calculating ad spending on Facebook, social media marketing firm Syncapse has introduced a free online tool that lets brand managers do the math.The tool, which went live Thursday morning, takes into account multiple variables that would affect such spending, including target market, market conditions and interests.[More from Mashable: Facebook Testing Automatic ‘Photo Syncing’ Feature For Android Phones]In a hypothetical example with a very broad target, Syncapse's calculator recommended that Kraft Foods' Oreo brand spend $27.6 million communicating with existing fans next year and $103 million going after friends of fans. Here's how it got to that number:First, the calculator asks for the size of your target market. You can also specify interests. Facebook has a database of 8 million or so such interests, which can range from celebrities (Martha Stewart) to sports (mountain biking) to TV shows (The Walking Dead.) In this case, no interest was specified:[More from Mashable: Arr! The Complete Guide to Celebrating Talk Like a Pirate Day]Scissons acknowledges that the online tool provides a ballpark estimate of spending and that various factors, including Facebook's steady stream of new advertising products, can't be anticipated. However, Scissons says his firm created the tool to illustrate that Facebook is more a platform for CRM than traditional marketing. "There are a lot of agencies on the market that are trying to buy cheap fans," Scissons says. "We're trying to educate the market that they should be thinking of reach and frequency."In the near future, Scissons believes, marketers will begin to think of "frequency" as the new advertising and will bank more on exposure via social media than would-be viral campaigns as a driver of purchases. For example, a woman who is interested in Coach handbags may be a Facebook fan, but she may not be interested in "engaging" with the brand on Facebook very much. However, if she's exposed to the right amount of messaging at the right frequency, eventually the brand will reach her when she's in the market for a handbag.If Scissons is right and marketers begin thinking about social media marketing as CRM, we'll see fewer out-of-the-box creative campaigns, but marketers may be happier overall with the results.What do you think?

112	california-man-behind-anti-islam-film-arrested-225906199	LOS ANGELES (AP) — The California man behind a crudely produced anti-Islamic video posted to YouTube that has inflamed parts of the Middle East was arrested for violating terms of his probation, authorities said Thursday.Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, 55, was convicted in 2010 for federal check and sentenced to 21 months in prison. Under terms of his probation, he was not allowed to use computers or the Internet for five years without approval from his probation officer.Nakoula was arrested after federal probation officials determined he violated the terms of his supervised release, said Thomas Mrozek U.S. Attorney's spokesman in Los Angeles.A U.S. District Court hearing was scheduled for Nakoula on Thursday afternoon. It was closed to media and the public.Protests have erupted around the Middle East over a 14-minute trailer for "Innocence of Muslims," which depicts Muhammad as a womanizer, religious fraud and child molester. Though the trailer was posted to YouTube in July, the violence didn't break out until Sept. 11 and has spread since, killing dozens.Nakoula, a Christian originally from Egypt, went into hiding after he was identified as the man behind the trailer.The full story about Nakoula and the video still isn't known.The movie was made last year by a man who called himself Sam Bacile. After the violence erupted, a man who identified himself as Bacile called media outlets including The Associated Press, took credit for the film and said it was meant to portray the truth about Muhammad and Islam, which he called a cancer.The next day, the AP determined there was no Bacile and linked the identity to Nakoula, a former gas station owner with a drug conviction and a history of using aliases. Federal authorities later confirmed there was no Bacile and that Nakoula was behind the movie.Before going into hiding, Nakoula acknowledged to the AP he was involved with the film, but said he only worked on logistics and management.A film permit listed Media for Christ, a Los Angeles-area charity run by other Egyptian Christians, as the production company. Most of the film was made at the charity's headquarters. Steve Klein, an insurance agent in Hemet and outspoken Muslim critic, has said he was a consultant and promoter for the film.The trailer still can be found on YouTube. The Obama administration asked Google, YouTube's parent, to take down the video but the company has refused, saying it did not violate its content standards.Meantime, a number of actors and workers on the film have come forward to say they were duped. They say they were hired for a film titled "Desert Warrior" and there was no mention of Islam or Muhammad in the script. Those references were dubbed in after filming was completed.Actress Cindy Lee Garcia has sued to get the trailer taken down, saying she was duped.	3	3	4	3	3	2	3	3	3	2	3	1	1	2	3	4
113	cameron-backs-minister-row-over-pleb-swipe-police-170135380	LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's David Cameron backed a senior minister accused of ranting at policemen in public and calling them "plebs", an old-fashioned insult laden with snobbery that has undermined his party's attempts to shake off its privileged image.The tirade outside the prime minister's Downing Street office by Andrew Mitchell has embarrassed a Conservative party that is trailing in the polls and struggling to shore up its support at a time of recession, tax increases and spending cuts.While reports that Mitchell called the officers "morons" were embarrassing, more damaging was the report that he used the word "pleb", a term that is rarely used by a middle or working class person but is soaked in upper class condescension.The row played into the hands of Conservative critics who think Cameron's centre-right party is run by a rich, lofty group whose policies do little for the majority of voters feeling the pressure of its austerity policies.Many senior Conservatives are millionaires, educated at Britain's top fee-paying schools and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.Rivals mock them as out-of-touch "toffs", the sort of derogatory term that is politically toxic in class-obsessed Britain. A Conservative politician described Cameron and chancellor George Osborne as "arrogant posh boys" in April.Cameron's spokesman said on Monday it was time to draw a line under the affair after Mitchell apologised again to police, even while denying using the words attributed to him."He has acknowledged that that behaviour was unacceptable and the apology has been accepted," the spokesman said. He would not be drawn on Mitchell's choice of words or whether he was accusing the police of not telling the truth."Pleb" is derived from a Latin word denoting people outside the aristocratic class in ancient Rome, for example shopkeepers, skilled or unskilled workers and farmers."It is old-fashioned language, it is private language. In public it is pretty awful," Peter York, the author and social commentator, told Reuters. "You certainly wouldn't expect any politician to utter it in a remotely public place."A leaked police report in the top selling Sun newspaper on Monday said Mitchell had lost his temper when police officers refused to open the main Downing Street gates to allow him to cycle through last Wednesday evening.BADLY TIMED TIRADEWhen they asked him to use a pedestrian gate, the report said Mitchell erupted: "Best you learn your fucking place. You don't run this fucking government. You're fucking plebs."The timing could not have been worse, coming a day after two unarmed policewomen were killed in a gun and grenade attack in Manchester, northern England.The Conservatives, who have run Britain in a coalition since 2010, are behind the opposition Labour Party before a 2015 election and the Mitchell row could cut further into their public support if it lingers, analysts said."They have been remarkably unsuccessful at killing this story," said John Curtice, politics professor at Strathclyde University in Scotland. "That's certainly a problem."Mitchell, 56, was educated at the prestigious Rugby School, home of one of the most famous literary bullies, Flashman, in the 19th-century novel "Tom Brown's Schooldays" by Thomas Hughes, an Oxford graduate.Labour leader Ed Miliband, who also went to Oxford, compared Cameron to Flashman last year for his behaviour in parliament.Mitchell went on to Cambridge University and served in the British Army before joining the Lazard investment bank and working for a management consultancy. Cameron gave him the job of "chief whip", or party enforcer, earlier this month.Mitchell said he "did not use the words that have been attributed to me", but repeatedly refused to confirm what he did say during an incident dubbed "Gate-gate" by wags on Twitter."It had been the end of a long and extremely frustrating day - not that that is any excuse at all for what happened," Mitchell told reporters in the rain outside his office near Downing Street. "I didn't show the police the amount of respect I should have done."Labour and police groups called for an inquiry into the events at Downing Street.Although still unconfirmed, the bad language has fed into a perceptions the Conservatives have not shed the "Nasty Party" tag that dogged them under Margaret Thatcher and John Major in the 1980s and 1990s. Cameron has attempted to soften their policies in areas like gay rights and support for the poor."There is this perception that ... they are posh, rich people who are out of touch with the lives of ordinary people," said Wyn Grant, politics professor at Warwick University."But if the government stands firm on this, it may simply just go away."(Additional reporting by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Mark Heinrich)	4	3	4	3	4	3	3	3	2	2	3	1	1	2	3	4
114	canada-august-inflation-slows-slightly-1-2-percent-123201300--business	OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate in August officially slipped to 1.2 percent from 1.3 percent in July, but there was in fact little difference between the two months, Statistics Canada said on Friday.Statscan analysts said the more precise August figure was 1.24 percent and had been rounded down to 1.2 percent. July's figure of 1.25 percent had been rounded up to 1.3 percent.Market analysts had expected a 1.3 percent year-on-year increase in August.The steady figure puts little pressure on the Bank of Canada to raise its key interest rate from the current near-record low of 1.0 percent.The central bank, which targets a 2 percent inflation rate, started signaling in April it might raise rates if the economy continued to grow.The only major component to drop in the 12 months to August was clothing and footwear, where prices fell by 1.2 percent on declines in the prices for women's clothing. Energy prices rose 0.8 percent following three consecutive months of year-over-year declines.The Bank of Canada's closely-watched core inflation rate - which strips out the prices of items such as gasoline, tobacco and some foodstuffs - dropped to 1.6 percent from 1.7 percent in July. Markets had expected the rate to fall to 1.5 percent.(Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Bernadette Baum)	2	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	2	2	1	1	1	3

117	capsule-reviews-dredd-3d-other-releases-032815057	"Dredd 3D" — A wickedly dark comic streak breaks up the vivid violence and relentless bleakness of this 3-D incarnation of the cult-favorite British comic series "2000 A.D." The visceral visuals, shot in 3-D by Oscar-winning "Slumdog Millionaire" cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, feature extreme close-ups and sequences of super-cool slow-motion photography, which wisely are spread sparingly throughout the course of the picture. Karl Urban stars as the stoic Judge Dredd, the baddest bad-ass of them all in a dystopian future where enforcers like him serve as judge, jury and executioner. Dredd is the most fearsome of the judges in the squalid, densely populated Mega City One, with his ever-present helmet and a low, monotone grumble that recalls both Christian Bale's Batman and Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name. (For the uninitiated, Dredd is actually much funnier than this description makes him sound; his terse, deadpan responses to the most absurd and depraved situations provoke the biggest laughs.) Olivia Thirlby has a calm yet confident presence as the rookie Judge Anderson, who happens to have been assigned to Dredd for training upon one particularly bloody day. Her psychic abilities make her an asset when things get especially chaotic, and her slightly ethereal nature provides a nice complement to Dredd's intense groundedness. Dredd and Anderson respond to a triple homicide at the Peach Trees housing complex, a 200-story ghetto ruled by the ruthless prostitute-turned-drug-lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey). When they take one of her lieutenants (Wood Harris) into custody, Ma-Ma puts the whole place on lockdown and insists she'll keep it that way until the judges are killed. R for strong bloody violence, language, drug use and some sexual content. 98 minutes. Three stars out of four.— Christy Lemire, AP Movie Critic___"End of Watch" — You've seen the buddy cop movie a million times before, especially the racially mismatched buddy cop movie. You've also seen the found-footage movie a million times before, beginning with the precedent-setting "Blair Witch Project" in 1999 and again in recent years following the success of the low-budget 2007 horror film "Paranormal Activity." ''End of Watch" combines these two approaches: It's a racially mismatched buddy cop movie in which the cops record their daily activities while on patrol, from mercilessly teasing each other in the squad car between calls to tracking bad guys through the dangerous streets and narrow alleyways of South Central Los Angeles. But admittedly, the found-footage aesthetic infuses the film with both intimacy and vibrancy; it creates the illusion that what we're watching is unscripted, and so we feel like we don't know what's going to happen from one moment to the next. And co-stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena have such tremendous chemistry with each other, they make you want to ride alongside them all day, despite the many perils in store. As they insistently goof on each other in often hilarious fashion, their banter reveals not just an obvious and believable brotherly bond but also the kind of gallows humor necessary to make the horrors of their profession tolerable. After responding to a series of seemingly random calls successfully, the partners find themselves the targets of a stereotypically vicious Mexican street gang, which may have even more dangerous ties south of the border. R for strong violence, some disturbing images, pervasive language including sexual references and some drug use. 108 minutes. Three stars out of four.— Christy Lemire, AP Movie Critic___"The Perks of Being a Wallflower" — This coming-of-age story, based on the best-selling young adult novel of the same name, features a well-chosen cast, an eclectic music mix and some moments of uncomfortable honesty as well as dreamlike wonder. It's anchored by strong performances on two ends of the acting spectrum: from Logan Lerman as Charlie, the high-school freshman of the film's title whose reserved nature can't hide his obvious intelligence and sweetness, and from Ezra Miller in a showy turn as Patrick, the quick-witted and gay senior-class clown who takes Patrick under his wing. The girl who completes their little triangle of blissful misfits is the perky but damaged Sam, played by "Harry Potter" star Emma Watson (without a trace of a British accent). Also a senior, Sam is Patrick's stepsister and Charlie's dream girl. Directed and written by "Perks" novelist Stephen Chbosky, the film follows these characters and their friends over a school year and all its rituals: football games, holidays, awkward dances and late-night gabfests at the local diner in their typical Pittsburgh suburb. Yes, it feels like formula, right down to rebellious thrill of experimenting with drugs and alcohol and the liberation of experiencing "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." But there's also a darkness that follows Charlie, even at his happiest, which keeps this movie from turning completely safe and self-satisfied. PG-13 for mature thematic material, drug and alcohol use, sexual content including references and a fight — all involving teens. 103 minutes.

118	cardiac-arrests-school-usually-not-students-205304465	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Student athletes collapsing from cardiac arrest in the middle of a game may grab headlines, but when someone's heart gives up at a school, it's usually not a youngster's.In a new five-year study, researchers from Michigan found that only two out of 47 cardiac arrests at K-12 schools occurred during sports events. In fact, as many as a third of cases happened after 5 pm and mostly in adults."Schools are community-gathering places, and two-thirds of our cases were adults," said Dr. Robert Swor, an emergency physician at Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak.His findings, based on registries and interviews with bystanders and school officials across the country, show that fewer than two out of every 1,000 cardiac arrests overall happen at K-12 schools. Sixteen of the 47 cardiac arrests at schools involved minors.Still, Swor told Reuters Health, "these are high-profile events individually. Every time something happens in a school like this it gets a lot of community awareness."After looking at how often cardiac arrests happen in schools, and who are the most frequent victims, Swor and his colleagues conclude more attention to emergency response capabilities and preparedness in schools is needed.Several states require schools to have automated external defibrillators, or AEDs, on site to treat cardiac arrests. The briefcase-sized devices let non-experts check a person's heart rhythm via patches glued to the chest. If the heart is beating too fast - known as ventricular tachycardia - to pump out enough blood, or just quivering chaotically in so-called ventricular fibrillation, the AED can jolt it back to its normal rhythm.Just last week, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed legislation making AEDs and cardiac emergency plans a requirement at all schools in the state.Swor's team, whose results were published in the journal Resuscitation, was able to interview people at 30 of the 47 schools they located.It turned out that 19 had AEDs. When the AED had been used, four out of 11 people survived until they were discharged from the hospital. When the device hadn't been used, the survival rate was two out of eight."It confirms that if you put the AED on you are in good shape, because we are talking about a 50-percent survival," said Dr. Myron Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University, who has studied AEDs but was not involved in the new work.About 300,000 Americans suffer cardiac arrest every year and fewer than eight in 100 leave the hospital alive. AEDs, which are placed in airports and many other public areas, may save nearly 500 lives every year, according to a study by Weisfeldt and colleagues from 2010.The devices can be bought for less than $2,000 and are easy for laypeople to use. Swor said it appeared that when they weren't used, it was often because bystanders had trouble identifying the signs of a cardiac arrest - for instance because the victim was convulsing or still gasping.When in doubt, he added, the AED should always be used because it won't deliver any shocks unless it detects a specific heart rhythm disturbance.Both Swor and Weisfeldt called for drills in schools to teach staff and students the signs of cardiac arrest, as well as how to give chest compressions and use an AED - and of course, call 911."We have fire drills, we have tornado drills," said Swor. Cardiac arrests "are not common, but they are certainly more common than a school being hit by a tornado."Weisfeldt added that seizing the chance to teach students CPR is not only helpful while they're in school, but might pay off down the road if they ever witness a cardiac arrest."It's a teachable moment," he said.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/S6MLMm Resuscitation, online September 20, 2012.	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	4	3	2	3	1	1	1	3	4
119	cardinals-beat-eagles-27-6-231846665--spt	GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Kevin Kolb got the best of his former team. Michael Vick might be wishing he was still in Philadelphia the way the Arizona Cardinals battered him around.Kolb threw for 222 yards and two touchdowns, James Sanders returned one of Vick's two first-half fumbles 93 yards for a touchdown and the Cardinals ran over the Eagles 27-6 on Sunday for their best start in 38 years.Kolb was sharp, hitting 17 of 24 passes, and Arizona (3-0) sacked Vick five times for its best start since 1974, more than a dozen years before the team moved to the desert. The Cardinals also have won seven straight home games, the second-longest streak in franchise history.Larry Fitzgerald was the guest conductor for the fall opening of the Phoenix Symphony on Thursday and kept the high notes going against the Eagles, catching nine passes for 114 yards and a touchdown while becoming the youngest player to reach 700 receptions.Philadelphia (2-1) became the first NFL team to open a season with two one-point wins. The Eagles didn't give themselves a chance to rally for another victory, picked apart by the quarterback they cast away and hounded by Arizona's attacking defense.The NFL's best offense the first two games, the Eagles had three turnovers, running their season total to 12, and labored all day against the scrappy Cardinals.After three years of waiting behind Donovan McNabb, Kolb was pushed aside when Vick made his triumphant return to the NFL.Even after being traded to Arizona and landing a huge contract extension, Kolb still had to fight for recognition.He lost a tight preseason battle with Skelton, but came off the bench in the opener against Seattle when Skelton sprained his right ankle. Kolb took the Cardinals on the winning drive and was steady enough last week to lead them to one of their biggest road victories in recent years, 20-18 over the New England Patriots.Skelton returned to practice late this week, but was limited and ended up watching Sunday's game in street clothes.Kolb, who missed last year's win over the Eagles with a foot injury, made the most of his opportunity, carving up Philadelphia's secondary with crisp passes.He completed all three of his throws on Arizona's opening drive to set up Jay Feely's 16th straight field goal, from 47 yards. After the Cardinals recovered a fumble by Eagles punt returner Damaris Johnson, Kolb threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Michael Floyd, who made his first NFL catch a memorable one by juggling the ball through two Philadelphia defenders.Kolb kept clicking in the second quarter, throwing a 37-yard touchdown pass to Fitzgerald that put the Cardinals up 17-0.Arizona's offense bogged down in the second half — 28 yards in the third quarter — but ground the game away with a time-consuming, 13-play drive in the fourth quarter that resulted in a 27-yard field goal by Feely for a 27-6 lead.Vick, on the other hand, spent most of his day being chased or knocked down.The Cardinals hit him hard twice on Philadelphia's first series and linebacker Sam Acho caused him to fumble with a hit early in the second quarter to end a drive into Arizona's end of the field.Vick finally got the Eagles going late in the first half, only to have it end in disaster.Forced to throw it away on two plays from Arizona's 1-yard line, he was blindsided by Kerry Rhodes on third down and fumbled. Sanders scooped it up and raced up the sideline, picking up a couple of blockers along the way to a 93-yard fumble return for a touchdown that put Arizona up 24-0 at halftime.The Eagles put up some yards in the second half, just not many points.Philadelphia opened the third quarter with two solid drives, but settled for a pair of field goals by Alex Henery and never threatened Arizona's lead.Vick had 217 yards on 17-of-37 passing after entering the game second in the NFL with 688 yards.Fitzgerald needed two catches to reach 700 and took care of it quickly, hitting the mark on a 4-yard pass from Kolb in the first quarter. He reached the milestone in 29 years and 23 days, eclipsing Dallas tight end Jason Witten, who hit the mark last week at 30 years and 133 days.___Online: http://pro32.ap.org/poll and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL	2	2	2	3	4	1	2	3	3	5	3	3	2	1	2	4

121	chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Presidential candidate Henrique Capriles is mobbed at rallies by ecstatic women who press close to touch him and leave scratches on his arms and neck. Some shout "Marry me!" to the single 40-year-old who's trying to unseat President Hugo Chavez in next month's hotly contested vote.The 58-year-old Chavez campaigns as the living legend who for more than 13 years has remade this oil-rich country in his socialistic vision. But he's also adjusting his approach as he confronts for the first time a younger, charismatic rival.The two are taking at times contrasting approaches ahead of Venezuela's Oct. 7 election but they're aiming for the same pool of swing voters made up of Venezuelans under 30 and women of all social classes.While recent polls show everything from a tie to a double-digit lead for Chavez, they've also revealed between 10 and 20 percent of voters who are either undecided or won't say whom they support.Most of those — about 1.5 million of them — are working-class voters who will play a crucial role in the election, said Angel Alvarez, a professor of political science at Venezuela's Central University.To try to persuade them, Chavez and his campaign have been using "the threat that Henrique Capriles has a package of secret economic measures that are going to seriously affect them," Alvarez said."As for Capriles' side, I'd say the strategy is to show that Chavez's government has performed badly in a range of areas from crime to jobs," Alvarez said. "Who will win? The one that manages to convince those voters... that his adversary is the more dangerous one."Capriles is also betting on his youthful appeal. He's campaigned vigorously in more than 200 towns nationwide, pumping hands and sweating among the crowds. The opposition-aligned organization Voto Joven, or Youth Vote, estimates that more than a third of registered voters are between the ages of 18 and 25, making them a key target for both camps.As the response at campaign events show, Capriles' appeal to women has become another asset, turning the lean, athletic candidate into a kind of opposition sex symbol.On the stump, Capriles has argued that he would inject a fresh voice into politics and replace a bloated administration that's run out of ideas. He also tries to reassure Venezuelans that he won't take away the social programs started by Chavez and will manage a peaceful transition of power."I ask each Venezuelan to reflect deeply, put your hand on your heart and think if it can be better, and think if after 14 years, whether the one who didn't come through is going to do it in the next six years," Capriles told supporters at a rally on Monday. "Think about it, young people, women."Chavez, for his part, faces a challenge rare in electoral politics: trying to appear fresh while seeking a third presidential term that would extend his time in office to two decades.First, Chavez has tried to erase doubts about his health after more than a year of cancer treatment. He's shown up on television singing and dancing, even at times slinging an electric bass guitar over his shoulder and pretending to play to the beat. Nonetheless, he's appeared at fewer rallies and has at times looked noticeably bloated and aged.He's also gone to great lengths to freshen up his image for younger voters. Instead of his military fatigues, he's been wearing casual blue jackets and occasionally a yellow scarf."Who's the candidate of the future?" the president shouted to thousands of supporters during a speech outside Caracas. "Chavez!"Singing with a band, the president then belted out the lyrics to his campaign jingle: "Chavez, heart of the people!"On the streets of Caracas, young supporters have painted cartoon-like murals depicting Chavez as a rapper with tattoos, a basketball player and a motorcycle-taxi driver — images apparently geared at making him seem cool to voters who've grown up during his presidency.Jacqueline Faria, a leading Chavez campaign official, said the murals simply reflect the love Chavez enjoys from Venezuela's youth. "The president has youth, youth exuding from every pore," she said.The president has also wielded a tougher message, telling voters in speeches that he stands for stability while his opponent represents "chaos" and would do away with the government's popular social programs."It would be a true fright, a civil war in Venezuela," Chavez said during a Sept. 11 news conference of a Capriles win. "With our great victory, we are going to continue leaving behind the horror."Capriles has said he wouldn't touch the government's programs and would improve what he said was their poorly administration.Chavez has also unleashed scathing rhetoric to paint Capriles as a protector of the wealthy "bourgeoisie," calling his ilk "fascists" and "neo-Nazis."Last week, Capriles was forced to boot a top aide from his campaign after the lawmaker was caught on video accepting a purported bribe. The grainy video has been replayed for days on state television since the scandal erupted.Violence has also broken out at campaign events, including a rock-throwing clash before a Capriles rally last week in which police said at least 14 people were hurt.In his speeches, Capriles has avoided name-calling, referring to his adversary as "the government's candidate" while chiding him for talking much and doing little. However, he has accused Chavez of lying about the government's achievements and neglecting the country's oil industry, infrastructure and agriculture."They're importing everything: rice, coffee, beef, milk," Capriles said in a speech this week. He also pointed to dramatically higher murder rates and said that in this vote, "We're going to make a life-and-death decision."With Capriles focusing on such concrete issues, Chavez "has no choice but to be doubly aggressive," said Alfredo Keller, a Venezuelan pollster and political consultant who says he isn't working for either side.Trying to hone their strategies, both candidates have reportedly turned to experienced campaign consultants for advice.Venezuelans newspapers have reported that Chavez hired Brazilian consultant Joao Santana, who ran the campaigns of Brazilian presidents Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Faria said she was unable to confirm the reports and that others in charge of the campaign "have sought out his advisers."Armando Briquet, Capriles' campaign manager, confirmed that Brazilian campaign consultants Renato Pereira and Francisco Chico Mendez, relative political newcomers, have advised the campaign on some issues. Briquet said, however, that the opposition leader's strategy has been homegrown and focused largely on "opening up spaces for feelings, for people to feel free to express themselves."Judging from the frenzy at Capriles rallies, the approach is working, especially among his women fans."I hugged him! I hugged him!" shouted housewife Andreina Delgado, trembling with excitement after throwing herself at Capriles amid a crowd of supporters in the rural town of Mamporal."He's our president," Delgado said, on the verge of tears. "Look at me. I'm overcome with emotion."Chavez has responded by trying to tie Capriles to the past, recently asking at a campaign rally, "Who's the candidate of the coup plotters of April?" referring to the 2002 putsch that briefly ousted Chavez. He followed with "Who's the candidate of the people? Who's the candidate of the homeland?"With a slower Chavez, however, Capriles' house-to-house campaigning can't help but conjure memories of another young, charismatic politician who crisscrossed the nation before he first won the presidency in 1998.This year, the president has had to campaign against that very image of himself."To win there has to be a deep emotional connection," Capriles said in an interview on his campaign bus. "I think the government's candidate has worn out his. He doesn't project that energy, that spark."	4	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	2	4	3	3	2	2	3	3

123	chef-found-guilty-murder-boiled-body-case-184522208	LOS ANGELES (AP) — A chef who boiled his wife's body for four days to hide evidence of her death was convicted of second-degree murder Thursday.In a recorded interrogation presented by prosecutors during the trial, David Viens, 49, can be heard saying he cooked the body of his 39-year-old wife, Dawn, in late 2009 until little was left but her skull.The chef spoke to authorities from a hospital bed in March 2011 after leaping off an 80-foot cliff in Rancho Palos Verdes. Authorities say he jumped after learning he was a suspect in her disappearanceThe trial relied heavily on recorded interviews with authorities in which the chef acknowledged the crime in detail."I just slowly cooked it and I ended up cooking her for four days," Viens could be heard saying on the recording.Viens, who attended his trial in a wheelchair, said in the interview that he stuffed his wife's body in a 55-gallon drum of boiling water and kept it submerged with weights.He said he mixed what remained after four days with other waste, dumping some of it in a grease pit at his restaurant in Lomita, and putting the rest in the trash.He said he stashed his wife's skull in his mother's attic in Torrance. But a search of the house turned up nothing, nor did an excavation of the restaurant.On the recording played in court, Viens was asked what happened on Oct. 18, 2009, the night his wife disappeared.He said he had noticed money missing from his restaurant and suspected his wife. They got into an argument, he said, and he forced her onto the floor where he wrapped her up and put a piece of duct tape over her mouth before going to bed.He awoke to find her dead and panicked, he said.Viens had pleaded not guilty.	3	4	3	4	3	2	3	3	4	2	3	2	1	5	3	3
124	chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281	BOSTON (AP) — A chemist accused of lying about drug samples she tested at a state lab could face additional charges as prosecutors and defense attorneys sift through thousands of criminal cases that could be upended by her actions.Annie Dookhan, 34, of Franklin, was arrested Friday in a burgeoning investigation that has already led to the shutdown of the lab, the resignation of the state's public health commissioner and the release of more than a dozen drug defendants.Many more defendants are expected to be released. Authorities say more than 1,100 inmates are serving time in cases in which Dookhan was the primary or secondary chemist."Annie Dookhan's alleged actions corrupted the integrity of the entire criminal justice system," state Attorney General Martha Coakley said during a news conference after Dookhan's arrest. "There are many victims as a result of this."Dookhan faces more than 20 years in prison on charges of obstruction of justice and falsely pretending to hold a degree from a college or university. She testified under oath that she holds a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts, but school officials say they have no record of her receiving an advanced degree or taking graduate courses there.State police say Dookhan tested more than 60,000 drug samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the Hinton State Laboratory Institute in Boston. Defense lawyers and prosecutors are scrambling to figure out how to deal with the fallout.Assistant Attorney General John Verner called the charges against Dookhan "preliminary" and said a "much broader" investigation is being conducted.Verner said state police learned of Dookhan's alleged actions in July after they interviewed a chemist at the lab who said he had observed "many irregularities" in Dookhan's work.Verner said Dookhan later acknowledged to state police that she sometimes would take 15 to 25 samples and instead of testing them all, she would test only five of them, then list them all as positive. She said that sometimes, if a sample tested negative, she would take known cocaine from another sample and add it to the negative sample to make it test positive for cocaine, Verner said.Dookhan pleaded not guilty and was later released on $10,000 bail. She was ordered to turn over her passport, submit to GPS monitoring, and not have contact with any former or current employees of the lab.Dookhan's relatives and attorney declined to comment after the brief hearing in Boston Municipal Court. Her next court date is Dec. 3.The obstruction charges accuse Dookhan of lying about drug samples she analyzed at the lab in March 2011 for a Suffolk County case, and for testifying under oath in August 2010 that she had an advanced degree from the University of Massachusetts, Attorney General Martha Coakley said at a news conference.In one of the cases, Boston police had tested a substance as negative for cocaine, but when Dookhan tested it, she reported it as positive. Investigators later retested the cample and it came back negative, Verner said.The only motive authorities have found so far is that Dookhan wanted to be seen as a good worker, Coakley said.According to a state police report in August, Dookhan said she just wanted to get the work done and never meant to hurt anyone."I screwed up big-time," she is quoted as saying. "I messed up bad; it's my fault. I don't want the lab to get in trouble."Dookhan's supervisors have faced harsh criticism for not removing her from lab duties after suspicions about her were first raised by her co-workers and for not alerting prosecutors and police. However, Coakley said, there is no indication so far of criminal activity by anyone else at the lab.Co-workers began expressing concern about Dookhan's work habits several years ago, but her supervisors allowed her to continue working. Dookhan was the most productive chemist in the lab, routinely testing more than 500 samples a month, while others tested 50 to 150.One co-worker told state police he never saw Dookhan in front of a microscope. A lab employee saw Dookhan weighing drug samples without doing a balance check on her scale.In an interview with state police late last month, Dookhan acknowledged faking test results for two to three years. She told police she identified some drug samples as narcotics simply by looking at them instead of testing them, a process known as dry labbing. She also said she forged the initials of colleagues and deliberately turned a negative sample into a positive for narcotics a few times."I hope the system isn't treating the evidence against her the way she treated the evidence against several thousand defendants," said defense attorney John T. Martin, who has a client who was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea based on concerns over Dookhan's work.Dookhan was suspended from lab duties after getting caught forging a colleague's initials on paperwork in June 2011. She resigned in March as the Department of Public Health investigated. The lab was run by the department until July 1, when state police took over as part of a state budget directive.___Niedowski reported from Franklin.

125	chevron-says-richmond-repair-time-unknown-135159619--finance	RICHMOND, California (Reuters) - Chevron Corp needs a few more weeks to assess damage at its plant in Richmond, California, and does not yet know how long it will need to repair its crude unit after an early August fire damaged the state's second-biggest refinery, its general manager said on Monday.The 245,000 barrels-per-day plant, which accounts for one-eighth of California's refining capacity, has run at a "reduced" rate since the fire, and this has risen only marginally since then, General Manager Nigel Hearne said in an interview.The lower throughput caused a jump in gasoline prices in California as traders scrambled to find alternative supplies. The crude unit shutdown has left California, which consumes more gasoline than any other U.S. state, vulnerable to price spikes when any of the state's 15 refineries have problems.The cause of the fire is also of great concern for the people living near the refinery. While investigations are still under way, the focus has centered on a failed pipe component less than 5 feet long.More than 200 residents gathered in a Richmond auditorium on Monday night to ask questions of the various regulatory bodies investigating the fire.Chemical Safety Board investigator Steve Cutchen said sections of the wall of the pipe had thinned to 20 percent of its design, and called the accident a "close call" that "could have been far worse."Chevron said this pipe had a low-silicon content, making it more susceptible to corrosion, which was understood by its technical staff but not acted upon. "Clearly it wasn't, so the question is why wasn't it," Hearne said in the interview.PLANT STILL UNDER INVESTIGATIONChevron found that, in a scheduled maintenance in November 2011, the 200 feet of piping in question had been inspected in 19 different locations, but not the component that failed.Asked how long the plant would be down, Hearne said assessments of the damage would need to be completed in the "next few weeks" to establish the timeline for repairs."We're still in the process of fully inspecting the plant," he said, including every individual component in carbon steel systems exposed to the same "high-temperature sulfidation corrosion" that it believes affected the pipe.Full access to the refinery had just been opened up by investigators. Analysts had expected repairs to the refinery's crude distillation unit, known as Crude Unit No. 4, to take between 3 months and 6 months. The hydrocarbons being processed at the plant were being provided by both the market and Chevron's other U.S. refineries, he added.The Richmond refinery, Chevron's oldest, opened 110 years ago.On Sunday, the San Francisco Chronicle reported the plant was being investigated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over a 3-inch (7.6-centimeter) pipe that let emissions bypass pollution control equipment.An EPA representative told the meeting on Monday that he could not give any timeline on that investigation, which is not related to the fire.Hearne said the pipe was not a deliberate design, and had been in place before the implementation of monitoring of flaring at the refinery. Chevron advised air quality regulators of the pipe three years ago, and had reviewed the rest of the refinery to make sure there were no similar lines elsewhere.But Loni Hancock, the California state senator for the local area, summed up the exasperation of many residents about the 3-inch pipe when she told the meeting on Monday night: "Whether inadvertent or deliberate, there's got to be a way to ensure that never happens again."(Reporting by Braden Reddall in Richmond and Erwin Seba in Houston; Editing by Andre Grenon, Gary Hill and Miral Fahmy)	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	2	4	3	1	1	1	4	4
126	chick-fil-face-backlash-not-opposing-gay-marriage-180500378	Chick-fil-A is back in the hot seat over gay marriage. This time, however, the tables are turned. A Chicago alderman, Joe Moreno, announced that he was dropping his opposition to the fried-chicken purveyor's plans to build a new restaurant on his turf, after the company sent him a letter essentially promising to stop donating money to groups who actively oppose same-sex marriage. Gay rights activists, who had been boycotting Chick-fil-A since CEO Dan Cathy said he believed in the "biblical definition" of marriage, cheered. Gay-marriage opponents, however, are furious. Is the chicken chain going to face another boycott over its social policies?This backlash will be worse than the first: Chick-fil-A faced a firestorm for opposing gay marriage, says Doug Stanglin at USA Today, but that was nothing compared to the fury it's facing now from gay-marriage opponents. They had flocked to the restaurant in solidarity, and now they're crushed that the company has apparently "caved." As one commenter on Chick-fil-A's Facebook page put it, the company now has "a whole new group of people who will no longer support" it. "Chick-fil-A's 'cave' stirs new backlash"SEE MORE: Chick-fil-A vs. gay-rights advocates: Winners and losersMaybe liberal businesses should brace themselves: I understand why Chick-fil-A would want to "forfeit their status as a national political lightning rod," says Allahpundit at Hot Air.

127	china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117	BEIJING (Reuters) - China's ruling Communist Party accused disgraced politician Bo Xilai of abusing power, taking huge bribes and other crimes on Friday, sealing the fate of a controversial leader whose fall shook a leadership handover due at a congress from November 8.The once high-flying Bo now faces a criminal investigation that stemmed from a murder scandal, and will almost certainly be jailed. With the Communist Party congress about six weeks away, further steps in the case could come before then, helping pave the way for a transition of power, experts said."Bo Xilai's actions created grave repercussions and did massive harm to the reputation of the party and state, producing an extremely malign effect at home and abroad," the official statement from a party leaders' meeting said, according to a report by the official Xinhua news agency.Bo's wife Gu Kailai and his former police chief Wang Lijun have already been jailed over the scandal stemming from the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood in the southwestern municipality of Chongqing, where Bo was Communist Party chief.The official statement carried by Xinhua said that in the murder scandal, Bo "abused his powers of office, committed serious errors and bears a major responsibility".That charge appears to reflect accusations from Wang's trial that suggested Bo tried to stymie the murder investigation.Reports that Bo, the "princeling" son of a revolutionary leader, could escape with a light punishment have now been dealt a fatal blow, and accusations of womanizing could further tarnish his reputation in the eyes of Chinese people.But the few weeks left before the congress will probably not allow time for a trial, said He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University who has closely followed Bo's downfall."I think it's quite certain that he won't be able to escape punishment under the criminal law, but the timing makes it unlikely that will happen before the congress," said He."I'd guess that he'll get a jail sentence of 20 years or longer. The death penalty is unlikely, although the bribery charges could in theory allow it, if the amount is as huge as they say."At the congress, Chinese President Hu Jintao will step down as party chief, almost certainly making way for Vice President Xi Jinping to emerge as top leader. Xi is then almost sure to be appointed state president at the annual parliament session, likely in March next year.WARNING TO HEED EXAMPLEBo, 63, has been expelled from the party as well as the elite decision-making Politburo and Central Committee "in view of his errors and culpability in the Wang Lijun incident and the intentional homicide case involving Bogu Kailai", said the party announcement.Bogu is his wife's official but rarely used surname.Bo's "grave violations of party discipline" extended back to his time as an official in Dalian city and Liaoning province in northeast China, and as minister of commerce, said the statement from the Politburo."Party organizations at all levels must use the case of Bo Xilai's grave disciplinary violations as a negative example," it said.Bo's son, Bo Guagua, who was a friend of the murdered Heywood, has remained largely silent throughout the fall of his parents. He appears to be still in the United States, after finishing graduate studies at Harvard University.Since Bo Xilai was ousted in March, he has not been seen in public and has not been allowed to answer the accusations against him. At a news conference days before his removal, Bo rejected as "filth" and "nonsense" the then unspecified allegations against him and his family.At the same time as announcing the slate of accusations against Bo, the party set the November 8 date for the congress that will unveil the country's new central leadership line-up. Eight is considered a lucky number in China.The twin announcements will "significantly reduce perceived political and economic risks" and "help end policy paralysis," Ting Lu, China economist Bank of America/Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong said in an emailed research note."If anything, this should make markets and the general public somewhat assured that this is not really being delayed too far," Damien Ma, an analyst for the Eurasia Group who follows Chinese politics, said of the November 8 congress date.LEFTIST SYMPATHISERS CRY FOULBo, 63, was widely seen as pursuing a powerful spot in the new political line-up before his career unraveled after his former police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to a U.S. consulate for more than 24 hours in February and alleged that Bo's wife Gu had poisoned Heywood to death.After his appointment as party chief of Chongqing in 2007, Bo, a former commerce minister, turned it into a showcase of revolution-inspired "red" culture and his policies for egalitarian, state-led growth. He also won national attention with a crackdown on organized crime.His brash self-promotion irked some leaders. But his populist ways and crime clean-up were welcomed by many of Chongqing's 30 million residents, as well as others who hoped that Bo could take his leftist-shaded policies nationwide.His likely trial could still stir that ideological contention. China's party-run courts rarely find in favor of defendants, especially in politically-sensitive cases.After state television announced the charges against Bo, some leftist sympathizers insisted that he was the innocent victim of a political plot."I just still don't believe that Bo has so many problems with corruption," Han Deqiang, a leftist Beijing academic who has supported Bo, told Reuters. "We have to wait and see what else comes out. But I don't think we've been given the truth."In March, Bo was sacked as Chongqing party boss, and in April he was suspended from the party's Politburo, a powerful decision-making council with two dozen active members.The latest party statement also said Bo "had or maintained improper sexual relations with multiple women". It added that the investigation discovered clues of other, unspecified crimes."We'll have to wait and see what charges are accepted by the prosecutors in any indictment," said Li Zhuang, a Beijing lawyer who was jailed by Bo after raising allegations that Chongqing's anti-crime gang policies involved torture and other unchecked abuses. "The charges could change."(Additional reporting by Michael Martina and Sally Huang in Beijing, and John Ruwitch in Shanghai; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	1	2	2	1	2	3	
128	china-seeks-discredit-bo-supporters-cry-foul-050857985	BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese government pressed ahead on Saturday with an effort to discredit fallen politician Bo Xilai, drawing an outcry from leftist supporters of the former leadership contender in a sign of the rifts that his prosecution could inflame.Once a charismatic yet divisive star who stood out on China's stolid political stage, Bo is almost sure to face trial and jail eventually after the ruling Communist Party announced his expulsion on Friday and issued a list of sordid allegations: bending the law to hush up a murder, taking huge bribes, and engaging in "improper sexual relations with multiple women."The party issued the damning accusations at the same time that it announced a November 8 for a congress that will anoint a new generation of top leaders - a lineup that Bo held barely disguised ambitions to join.Bo's downfall has unsteadied preparations for that leadership succession, and exposed revelations of high-level abuse of power after his former police chief briefly took refuge in a United States consulate and exposed allegations that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, murdered a British businessman.State media tried to draw a clear line between Bo and the party elite he once belonged to, casting his fall as a victory for the party's determination to fight corruption."No matter how high a position, no matter how influential, anyone who violates party discipline and state law will be sternly pursued and punished," said a commentary on the case issued by the official Xinhua news agency."As a senior party official, Bo Xilai should have been a model of obedience to party discipline," it said. "But instead he monopolized power and behaved recklessly, doing as he pleased and gravely violating discipline," added the commentary, which was widely distributed by state media websites."His misdeeds deserve their punishment."DEMONISATION AND DISILLUSIONMENTThe party could face trouble, however, convincing skeptics that it has only recently awoken to Bo's crimes, which it traced way back to his years as a city official in northeast China. Bo's leftist supporters have already revived charges that Bo is the victim of a plot to eradicate him and his populist policies."Last night, one of the core members of the ruling party's leadership was suddenly turned into a demon," said one commentary on "Red China", a far-left Chinese-language website that has issued a torrent of commentary defending Bo."Unlike other ousted senior officials, Bo Xilai's downfall has triggered two diametrically opposed reactions in society - one of elation and relief, and the other of outrage and regret."The "Red China" site has been blocked to the many Chinese users who do not know how to evade censorship barriers. But China's version of Twitter, "Weibo", has also echoed with debate about Bo's dramatic downfall.Public support for Bo is unlikely to creep into the heavily regimented party congress, but the effort to disgrace him could foster deeper public disillusionment with the party by showing that one of its formerly favored officials was steeped in corruption. Bo, 63, is the "princeling" son of a Communist Party official who served alongside Mao Zedong."He won support from the underdogs of society and the radical intellectuals, and maybe even some within the party and the military," said Lai Hongyi, who teaches about contemporary China at the University of Nottingham in Britain. "That's probably quite polarizing because you are not talking about just a few people but a segment of the whole of Chinese society and the establishment."After arriving in Chongqing in 2007, Bo turned it into a showcase for pro-growth economics, and ran a campaign against organized crime, policies welcomed by many of the city's 30 million residents, though his brash self-promotion irked some leaders in Beijing.Bo's wife Gu Kailai and his former police chief Wang Lijun have already been jailed over the scandal stemming from the murder in November of British businessman Neil Heywood.The official statement carried by Xinhua said that in the murder scandal, Bo "abused his powers of office, committed serious errors and bears a major responsibility." That charge appears to reflect accusations from Wang's trial that suggested Bo tried to stymie the murder investigation.The government also accused Bo of taking huge bribes and other unspecified crimes. Before Bo is charged and tried, investigators must first complete an inquiry and indict him, but China's prosecutors and courts come under party control and are most unlikely to challenge the accusations.(Additional reporting by John Ruwitch in Shanghai; Editing by Daniel Magnowski)	4	3	3	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	4	4
129	china-trade-minister-visit-canada-could-mention-cnooc-182419431--finance	OTTAWA (Reuters) - Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming will visit Canada next week as Ottawa deliberates whether to approve a landmark $15.1 billion takeover of oil producer Nexen Inc by state-owned Chinese oil company CNOOC Ltd.CNOOC said it did not expect Chen to raise the sensitive takeover bid during talks with the Canadian government. Canada China Business Council president Peter Harder, however, said he would not be surprised if Chen mentioned it in a speech to his group next Tuesday.Although Canada is seeking substantial foreign investment in its oil and gas industry, the CNOOC move is raising concern inside cabinet, where some members are wary of letting a Chinese state-owned enterprise buy up domestic assets.Industry ministry officials are looking closely at the bid to determine whether it is of net benefit to Canada.Separately, Canada's spy service said some foreign state-owned enterprises could pose a threat to national security. It did not mention China by name.Canadian Trade Minister Ed Fast gave little away when asked about a planned meeting with Chen in the next few days."I do expect it will be a productive meeting as we move the Canada-China relationship forward," he told reporters on Friday.Nexen - whose shareholders voted to accept the CNOOC deal on Thursday - said it was unaware of Chen's visit.A spokesman for CNOOC said it did not expect Chen and Fast to discuss the bid "because this is transaction between two commercial companies, not a government to government affair". The Chinese embassy was not immediately available for comment.China's Ministry of Commerce is responsible for authorizing investments of more than $100 million by state-owned enterprises.When Chen addresses a lunch arranged by the Canada China Business Council next week in Toronto, he could well talk about the CNOOC bid, council president Harder said, noting the minister had done so in a speech in Beijing last week."I think he would express the view that the transaction should be looked at as a business transaction and be seen on its merits and that China would hope that that would be the case," he told Reuters in a phone interview.Harder said that in Chen's Beijing speech last week, he had mentioned a foreign investment promotion and protection agreement signed by Canada and China this month as well as China's willingness to broaden economic relations between the two countries.Canada says it needs C$630 billion ($643 billion) in investment in its energy sector over the next decade. It is also promoting the idea of oil sales to China.Critics of the CNOOC deal point out that China is running a large trade surplus with Canada. They also complain Canadian natural resources companies find it hard to operate in China.Canada's spy service, in a report issued on Thursday, said some bids by state-owned enterprises to gain control over strategic sectors of the Canadian economy could threaten national security interests."The foreign entities might well exploit that control in an effort to facilitate illegal transfers of technology or to engage in other espionage and other foreign interference activities," the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) said."CSIS expects that national security concerns related to foreign investment in Canada will continue to materialize."Pressed about the report, Fast said Canada always took security into account when negotiating economic deals. "It would be our top priority to ensure Canada remains safe and secure," he said.Prime Minister Stephen Harper said last month that public opinion would play a role in determining whether to approve the bid or not.The official opposition New Democratic Party says it is concerned about a Chinese state-owned firm buying what they call a strategic Canadian asset. Nexen controls less than 5 percent of the crude-rich tar sands in the western province of Alberta, one of the world's biggest oil deposits, where its Canadian properties are concentrated.(Additional reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg; Editing by Peter Galloway)	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	2	2	3	2	1	2	3	4
130	chris-cuomo-takes-extreme-fitness-dont-191319721--abc-news-health	"The only constant in life is change."That may be true, in general, but it is not always so when it comes to working out. Most of us stick to what we know when it comes to exercise. You know, our comfort zone, the standard 45 minutes of machine cardio, the three-day splits for weights. We like it because we know what to do, how long it will take, and we assume that the repetition will yield gains (or reductions, depending on goals).Alas, we are wrong. Science now shows the body is much more adaptable to routines. That means that the body starts working less hard asap because it is designed to conserve energy. When that happens, it stops tearing muscle fibers and burning calories, results diminish, and we start having diminishing returns on our efforts.But, there is good news! The way to defeat this is often not by doing more, but by doing less - in terms of duration, anyway. Turns out, when the body tries something new, the learning curve makes it fire and burn more, yielding quicker results. We also know that using whole body moves and routines, increase yield even more so. Add to that, the data suggesting that interval work (alternating spikes and rest periods during cardio or lifting) actually send the body on a fat-burning-frenzy lasting hours after the workout ends. So, you can get more out of a workout in less time, and the benefits will last much longer than your typical workout.Sounds too good to be true. I thought so too, until I tried it out.For Men's Health Magazine, I started trying new routines every month or so to see if I could accelerate gains, while also cutting down in the length and frequency of workouts. And it worked! As long as you keep your body guessing (read: try new stuff every so often) you will out gain the person who is plodding through the same old cardio and weight slog.Out of the box I tried a Thai-boxing workout, not because I wanted to get my ass beat, but because I wanted to whup my ass into shape. The mix of dynamic cardio, striking, and sparring was new and challenging and it worked. As a guy who already had a solid base of muscle and fitness, I saw my body change from the new routine. Stronger core, less fat. Here is the story.The theory worked so well that we started shooting video of my often painful introductions to "what's next." The first clip was really outside the box for me. I went a benefit and there was a dance recital, and I was ready for a good nap, when these big, ripped guys, who resembled NFL defensive backs in leotards came bounding on stage. Alvin Ailey Dancers. No joke. I reached out to Glen Sims, the lead, for a look at how they get so damn big and flexible.Upper-body power comes from traditional weight work, but those springs and abs got some extra work: the Horton Technique, their daily 45-minute "length is strength" routine that emphasizes all the assistive muscles in the legs. Think Jane Fonda's floor moves with super intensity. The best proof: Sims has not suffered an injury in 15 years of performances. Guys out there probably wince at the idea of doing stretching as a repetitive part of a workout, but in four weeks, I had more definition in my legs, a "stronger for longer" core, more lunge power and spring on the court - not to mention I could get all my fingers on the floor when stretching hammys. At least, you will take solace in watching my struggle. Surely you can better than this.Our last offering for now was my trip to Peak Performance in NYC. Joe Dowdell knows his fitness science, and has melded what we know about full body workouts and the benefits of disrupting the body's expectations for exertion (muscle confusion, increased metabolic stimulation, and a bunch of other science-y stuff). But what makes Joe different and cool is that he has adapted those principles to old-school, strong-man type activities. It makes for a really different workout. Pushing a weighted sled, snapping cruise line-sized ropes, throwing a medicine ball, carrying dead weight - it all sounds old-school, and it is.There's a unique feeling of power when doing these ostensibly primitive movements, and yet the pace and form employed burns you in a way that is motivated by the latest in fitness expertise.The result is that Joe, with burst-style, shorter workouts, gets you to train at "Peak Performance." Watch me wither.What should Chris try next? Pilates? Parkour? We are looking to make him the Mike Rowe of workouts… what's the toughest stuff you can toss his way? Let us know what you think!

131	christies-offers-bond-items-50th-anniversary-093747399	LONDON (Reuters) - Christie's will offer 50 items of James Bond memorabilia over the coming week in a charity sale that culminates in a live auction next Friday, the 50th anniversary of the release of the first 007 movie "Dr. No".The auction, which will raise funds for a range of charities including UNICEF, is one of a series of events being held around the world to mark the anniversary of one of the world's longest-running and most successful film franchises.Fifty lots will be up for sale, many of them coming from EON Productions, the company behind the movie series.Of the total, 40 will be sold online between September 28 and October 8 and 10 of the star items have been reserved for the live auction on October 5, "Global James Bond Day", at Christie's offices in South Kensington in London.All lots will go on public display there from Saturday until October 4. Admittance is free."I think what we wanted to do was to celebrate the 50th anniversary in a meaningful way and let people have the opportunity to buy some of the things in our archive that we could raise money for charity from," said Michael G. Wilson, who along with Barbara Broccoli is guardian of the Bond films."There's a lot of things ... from 1,000 pounds ($1,600) on up, really," he told Reuters. "There's plenty of things for a whole range of collectors."Among the highlights for him was a one-third scale model of an Aston Martin DB5 used in the filming of "Skyfall", the next Bond adventure which hits the screens in October.The car was used in earlier Bonds and has become closely associated with the fictional double agent."In Skyfall we go back to the old Aston Martin, the DB5, we bring that out of mothball," Wilson said."We used it in the film but we had to make a model of it. We made an extra model, one third scale ... that was made for the film and I think that's a pretty unique thing to get."The model is expected to fetch 30-40,000 pounds, while another Aston Martin built in 2008 and used in the opening sequence of the last Bond movie "Quantum of Solace" has a price tag of 100-150,000 pounds.There is also a special edition of Bollinger champagne on offer for 10-15,000 pounds."Can you imagine, a champagne that comes out in an edition of 12 only?" Wilson said.He added that Bond producers had been working with a number of charities for some time, although their ties to UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, were particularly close through the involvement of former Bond actor Roger Moore.Among the smaller items being sold are 10 tarot cards used by Jane Seymour playing the character Solitaire in "Live and Let Die" and a belt with a golden bullet buckle worn by Christopher Lee as Scaramanga in "The Man With the Golden Gun"."With memorabilia offered from every official Bond film ever made, the auction is sure to appeal to new and established fans of the famous British spy," said Nicolette Tomkinson, a director at Christie's.(Reporting by Mike Collett-White, editing by Paul Casciato)	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	1	2	2	2	1	3	
132	chuck-norris-ambushed-slovak-bridge-freedom-153045040	BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovak officials rejected the overwhelming results of a popular Internet campaign to name a new pedestrian and cycling bridge near the capital after U.S. action film star Chuck Norris.Despite 12,599 votes for the Norris name in a two-month online poll, Bratislava regional assembly decided to call the bridge spanning the Morava river and Slovakia's border with Austria the "Freedom Cycling-Bridge" in memory of people killed attempting to escape communist eastern Europe.The assembly's choice earned only 457 votes in the online poll, where it was easily outshone by other proposed names, including "Maria Theresa" after an Austro-Hungarian empress and "the Devinska cycling bridge" in honour of a nearby village."We have unanimously voted for the Freedom Cycling-Bridge," Bratislava region chairman Pavol Freso told reporters."It truly is a place where people were running for freedom through barbed wire, it is a place where many have died, so this is a dignified way how to honour these people."Slovakia, once part of the former Czechoslovakia, has a 107 km border with Austria and many people died trying to flee the communist regime before its collapse in 1989.Norris, a martial arts expert-turned film star, is known for playing tough guy characters in such classic movies as "Lone Wolf McQuade", "Missing in Action" and "The Delta Force".The actor's work has become a popular source of kitschy fun among Slovaks and a mainstay for local jokes about macho strength and invincibility.(Reporting by Martin Santa, editing by Paul Casciato)	3	4	1	3	4	4	2	2	3	2	4	3	2	2	3	4

134	colorado-frozen-dead-guy-festival-without-corpse-013004367	DENVER (Reuters) - The frozen corpse that has inspired a Colorado town's whimsical "Frozen Dead Guy Days" celebration may soon be put on ice somewhere else, but festival organizers said the body's removal will not have a chilling effect on the annual event."We will continue on whether or not Bredo Morstoel is here," festival owner Amanda MacDonald said Wednesday of the man whose body has been packed in dry ice outside Nederland, Colorado, since 1993.A financial dispute between Morstoel's grandson, Tryve Bauge, and the man hired to replenish the dry ice on a monthly basis, Bo Shaffer, has led to Bauge threatening to move his grandfather's body out of Colorado.Each month for 18 years, Shaffer has hauled 1,700 pounds (770 kg) of dry ice - carbon dioxide in solid form - to a remote shed above Nederland to keep the corpse of Morstoel at minus-24 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-31 degrees Celsius) and in a state of cryonic suspension.But Shaffer said he quit after Bauge refused to pay for the rising costs of fuel and ice, which has made the endeavour unprofitable."It takes two of us to make the four-hour roundtrip," Shaffer told Reuters. "My quitting is the only way to get his (Bauge's) attention."Bauge, who lives in Norway, did not immediately return an email message seeking comment about the dispute. But he told the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper that he is exploring the possibility of moving his grandfather to the Cryonics Institute in Michigan.Cryonics is the process of freezing and storing a corpse to prevent decomposition in anticipation of medical technology that could bring the dead back to life. Liquid nitrogen, which is far colder than dry ice, is typically used for cryonic preservation.Morstoel died of heart failure in his native Norway in 1989, and Bauge had his grandfather's body frozen and transported to a cryonics facility in California. Ultimately he had the corpse moved to Nederland, where Bauge lived at the time.When Bauge was deported because of an expired visa, he hired Shaffer to act as an unofficial caretaker.COFFIN RACES, HEARSE PARADEAt first, townspeople in the mountain village 17 miles (27 km) southwest of Boulder, Colorado, were aghast at the thought of a frozen body being stored in their midst.But they ultimately embraced the idea of an annual festival surrounding its most famous, albeit deceased, resident.The late-winter celebration features activities such as coffin races, a hearse parade, a frozen salmon toss and snow beach volleyball. There are even tours to the site of Morstoel's sarcophagus, although his remains are not open for viewing.MacDonald said the festival attracts about 10,000 people over its three-day run, which is held in early March, and has taken on a life of its own, with or without its namesake dead guy.The nonprofit Cryonics Institute in Clinton Township, Michigan, was founded by the late physicist Robert Ettinger, who was known as a pioneer in cryonics.His son, David Ettinger, said by telephone that privacy concerns prevent him from discussing any potential patients. However, he did say ideal candidates for suspension are people who have recently died.Such was the case with his father, he said, who was prepared for the procedure in the days before his death in 2011 at the age of 92."We've never had a patient presented to us under those circumstances," he said of a corpse that has been packed in dry ice for nearly two decades.The institute has about 100 suspended corpses, and charges a one-time $35,000 fee and $120 annually for "human cryopreservation."(Editing by Steve Gorman and Xavier Briand)	4	3	2	4	3	3	3	4	4	2	3	2	2	2	3	4
135	column-wary-spies-ryder-cup-224607350--golf	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) — There are, apparently, spies lurking on the golf course, which is why the Americans have been so careful in practice this week to avoid putting toward anything that looks as if it might be a possible hole location in the Ryder Cup.It seems a bit silly, but for the people involved in this biennial golf match between a country and a continent, this is serious stuff.That double breaker the Europeans might not see could cost one of them a hole. Cutting the rough down could determine another match.That could be the difference between Europe retaining the Ryder Cup, or the U.S. winning the little trophy that no one ever cared much about before the Euros started taking it away. And that might be the difference between a golf world dominated by people whose ancestors invented the game or those who helped perfect it.Should I go on? You want your next sleeve of Titleists stamped "Made in Europe?"Never mind that the 12 Europeans are fairly sophisticated players who should be able to read a putt if it was in a canyon on Mars. For the most part they've all shown they can play under pressure, even if Michael Jordan is following them in his golf cart with a menacing look on his face.But figuring out a way to win a team match in an individual game has perplexed team captains for years. There's no logic to it, as evidenced by Tiger Woods being on only one winning team in his career.When the U.S. did pull out a win at Valhalla four years ago, captain Paul Azinger wrote a book about it. Something about pods and personalities and how that gets the ball in the hole in less strokes than your opponent, it has yet to be made into a movie.Davis Love III might not have a book in him, even if the U.S. captain manages to lead his charges to a win in this one. That's a good thing, because there's been so much analysis in the golf community— including 50 hours of Golf Channel alone this week — about what the two teams have to do to win that watching Justin Timberlake recite a golf poem set to music at the opening ceremony Thursday was as much a relief as it was a giggle."It's my first Ryder Cup, you guys!" Timberlake exclaimed.Still, some questions remain to be answered before play finally begins Friday morning. Among them are:—Is it better to have the old Woods — who would barely acknowledge his opponent's existence — or the new one who is BFF with Rory McIlroy? Woods is a mediocre 13-14-2 in the Ryder Cup, so his new cheerful attitude with his playing partners — the intimidator McIlroy in particular — can't hurt.—Will Medinah Country Club with no rough favor the U.S. as Love hopes? Or should he also have ordered all the ponds drained just in case an errant shot by one of the Americans went toward the water? Europeans, as we have found out in recent Ryder Cups, have special balls that are magnetically repelled from both rough and water during crucial matches.—Will Europeans understand what a red-out is? The PGA of America is taking a page from collegiate arenas by asking fans to wear red on Sunday to support the home team. Might work, though comically enough the PGA also is asking fans at home to wear red, too.—Does ping pong really strengthen the soul? For some reason, U.S. players like to play ping pong — and a lot of it. They're convinced ping pong brings the team together, and to make sure they've got three tables in the team room this year instead of two.—Will the U.S. have another equipment malfunction? It rained at the Ryder Cup in Wales two years ago on the opening day, and U.S. players were soaked in their leaky rain gear. They never seemed to recover, and Europe ended up regaining the cup.—Will Jordan as an assistant coach advise the U.S. to play zone or man-to-man against the Euros? More importantly, will he step up to take out McIlroy with a well-placed screen if needed?—Does Love understand the concept of dollar beer day? Imagine the possibilities on Sunday with tens of thousands of well lubricated fans cheering the home team on.It's all been analyzed more than Jim Furyk's swing, picked apart more than Tiger's brain.

136	common-heart-drugs-may-less-helpful-thought-201902320	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The cheap and popular heart drugs known as beta-blockers may be overused in many patients, exposing them needlessly to bothersome side effects, a new study suggests.Researchers found that people with stable heart disease who took beta-blockers were no less likely to die from their condition, or to suffer a heart attack or stroke, than were those not on the medications.Although the study is not conclusive, it "is definitely going to make some waves," said Dr. Lydia Bazzano of Tulane University in New Orleans, who studies heart disease prevention, but wasn't part of the new work."I think there are probably plenty of people out there who are getting (beta-blockers), but don't need them," Bazzano told Reuters Health.Beta-blockers such as atenolol and metoprolol slow the heartbeat and lower blood pressure.They are known to shield against future heart attacks in people who just had one and can be helpful in certain types of heart failure. Older studies have suggested staying on beta-blockers in the long run may be beneficial, so many doctors have their patients take the drugs indefinitely.But those results predate modern treatment, researchers say. And whether or not beta-blockers can ward off heart attacks in the first place is still up in the air.Because beta-blockers are now off patent, drug companies have little incentive to study their effects in expensive clinical trials - the gold-standard in medical science for demonstrating what a treatment does and does not do.So Dr. Sripal Bangalore of the NYU Langone Medical Center in New York and colleagues did the next-best thing. They used data from a registry of nearly 45,000 people with established coronary artery disease or risk factors for heart disease to get a sense of the drugs' efficacy.In coronary artery disease, or CAD, the blood vessels supplying the heart are partially clogged by cholesterol buildups, which can lead to heart attacks.The researchers sliced the registry according to whether people had suffered a heart attack, had CAD but no past heart attack, or just had risk factors such as diabetes and high blood pressure.During an average follow-up period of 44 months, people on beta-blockers fared no better than others in any of the three groups.In people with CAD, for instance, 12.9 percent of those on beta-blockers either died from heart disease or had a heart attack or a stroke. That compared to 13.6 percent of those not on the drugs - a difference that could easily be due to chance.Among people with risk factors alone, 14.2 percent of those on beta-blockers had a bad outcome versus 12 percent of non-users.There was no difference in outcomes overall among people with prior heart attacks who did or did not use beta-blockers. However, those who'd suffered a heart attack within the past year and took beta-blockers seemed to be slightly less likely to fare ill or land in the hospital due to their condition."A lot of physicians still prescribe beta-blockers, especially in patients who have known CAD," said Bangalore, whose findings are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "We need clinical trials to say which are the patients who would benefit from beta-blockers."Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol levels through exercise, diet changes and drugs are common ways to treat heart disease. After a heart attack, patients are also typically put on clot-busters and blood thinners such as aspirin.Beta-blockers are cheap - a month's supply of the generic versions can be bought for less than $10 - but often cause side effects, including fatigue, depression and nightmares."I think there has been a movement away from beta-blockers," said Bazzano, including as a blood pressure medication. "A lot of people don't like to be on them."Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist who was not involved in the new study, said it is consistent with recent guidelines from the American Heart Association.The group says beta-blockers are most effective in the first three years after a heart attack and in patients with certain types of heart failure. In other cases, their use is "optional," according to 2011 guidelines.Krumholz, of Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, said he often leaves patients on beta-blocker therapy "forever" after a heart attack."This is raising the question of whether or not we need to keep them on it," he said.He cautioned that there may be specific reasons why doctors would still put patients with heart disease on beta-blockers, such as high blood pressure or chest pain.But in general, Krumholz concluded, "The best thing is for every patient to be on as few medicines as possible, and only the ones that are the most helpful to them."SOURCE: http://bit.ly/MvXYT6 JAMA, online October 2, 2012.	4	4	4	3	4	2	4	4	2	3	3	2	1	2	4	4
137	congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299	KINSHASA (Reuters) - Any Tintin fan would feel at home in the small wooden shed in a back street of Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa, where the shelves are crammed with brightly painted statues from the famous Belgian cartoon character's adventures.Friendly faces are everywhere - the tufted-haired Tintin, the bearded Captain Haddock and the bumbling policemen Thomson & Thompson - lovingly carved from wood and carefully painted in bold colours.But with Kinshasa preparing to receive a flood of visitors for an international summit of French-speaking countries next month, some are questioning whether Congo should turn its back on the boy journalist, whose fictional adventures in the then-Belgian colony depicts Africans as dull-witted and childish.Tintin's relationship with Congo dates back to 1930 when his creator Georges Remi - better-known by his pen name Herge - first wrote "Tintin in the Congo", in which the intrepid reporter and his little white dog Snowy tackle wild animals, hunters, diamond smugglers and warlike local chieftains.Tintin statues - which can sell for anything from $15 to $1500 - are part of Congo's roaring trade in the comic's memorabilia, business that could receive a boost next month as delegates from 56 countries across the French-speaking world gather in Kinshasa for the Francophonie summit.Tourists can find stalls and street vendors across the riverside capital selling the figures, and can even buy personalised paintings of the book's front cover, with their names expertly added by the artist.But it is Herge's heavily stereotyped depiction of Africans as fat-lipped, childlike savages that makes Tintin a controversial cultural figure for a country trying to turn its back on a brutal colonial past followed by decades of dictatorship and conflict, according to professor Joseph Ibongo Gilungule, the director of Congo's national museum."Tintin is an image created by westerners, and it proves the ignorance of these people, a lack of understanding for our values," Ibongo told Reuters.Ibongo wants more people to celebrate the rich cultures of the country's estimated 250 ethnic groups.His museum is a celebration of the masks, headdresses and clothing that have played an integral part in Congo's traditional values, but few of the country's 70 million inhabitants come to visit the museum.BANISHED TO THE TOP SHELVESIbongo is not against preserving relics of Congo's colonial past - he is trying to find money to rehabilitate the statue of controversial British colonial explorer Henry Morton Stanley, which lies forlornly toppled behind a shed at the museum.Nonetheless, with so many people due to visit the country for the Francophonie summit in October, he believes Congo should find a better poster boy than Tintin."There are other strong images which speak positively of this country, its peoples... It would be more respectful to Congo and the whole of Africa if we spoke of images that value the Congo, and not Tintin," Ibongo added.Earlier this year a Congolese man studying in Belgium tried and failed to have the book banned on the grounds of racism. Some stores in Britain have banished it to the top shelves, where only adults can see it.Even Tintin's creator Herge later re-wrote parts of the story, toning down the more extreme stereotypes which sprang from Belgium's colonisation of Congo, which was brutal even by the standards of the day.Auguy Kakese, an artisan who specialises in Tintin statuettes, acknowledges that it was Europeans who first suggested he carve the figures and most of his clients remain westerners. But he sees no harm in it."It's humour, it's not racist... for those who say it's racist I say that in the comic strip, you never see images which show him trying to kill the Congolese," Kakese said in his workshop, which employs 10 people and produces thousands of Tintin statues.Although most of the statues Kakese sells are of the comic's European characters, he does not shy away from depicting the Africans as well, despite them seeming uncomfortably stereotyped for modern tastes."We were a Belgian colony, if we work with Tintin now it's to say that the Belgians are still our brothers," he added.A recent showing in Kinshasa of the Steven Spielberg-directed Tintin movie attracted a small but varied audience, everyone from Congolese to Koreans.Although the audience were aware of the cartoon's sometimes complex relations with Congo, none saw it as a huge problem."I really don't think it is racist, it was just the whites wanting to interpret what they saw in Congo at the time," Congolese Tito Biteketa said.Christiana Finotti, an Italian expatriate, said she had bought a Tintin picture for her friend but acknowledged that not all her Congolese colleagues were comfortable with the association."Tintin in the Congo is still a little difficult, due to the style of Belgian colonialism, and due to the history... I think there's been a reconciliation, but the reconciliation hasn't been easy," she said.(Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Paul Casciato)	4	4	3	2	4	3	2	4	3	2	3	2	1	1	4	4
138	connecticut-man-shoots-burglar-dead-turns-own-son-181159828	(Reuters) - A Connecticut man responding to his sister's call for help during an apparent burglary at her home next door, shot and killed a masked intruder who turned out to be his own teenage son, state police said on Friday.Tyler Giuliano, 15, was wearing a ski mask and appeared to be armed when he was shot on Thursday by his father, who authorities declined to identify, said Lieutenant J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police.The father's sister, who lives next door, was home alone before 1 a.m. when she called him to report someone trying to break into her home. The father went over to investigate and was approached by a masked person dressed entirely in black and holding a shiny object, police said in a statement."Believing the suspect was armed with a weapon and about to attack him, the (father) discharged his personal handgun at the suspect," police said in the statement.Giuliano was pronounced dead at the scene."(He) was lying on the ground in the driveway with obvious gunshot injuries, holding a weapon," the statement said.Vance declined to further describe the weapon.Authorities seized the father's gun, were investigating whether it is registered and will consult with the state's attorney to determine if any charges will be filed, Vance said.Police also were investigating why the teen, who has no criminal history, was outside his aunt's home."We truly don't know. We'll look at the family dynamics, (his) school locker, cell phone, computer to figure out what's going on," Vance said.(Reporting by Barbara Goldberg in New York; Editing by Paul Thomasch and Vicki Allen)	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	3	1	1	3	3	4
139	conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance	ASTANA (Reuters) - U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips is ready to exit the consortium developing Kazakhstan's Kashagan oil field, Kazakh officials said, giving the state first option on increasing ownership of the biggest oil find since the 1960s.A more assertive Kazakhstan, seeking greater returns on the large energy projects that will drive central Asia's biggest economy over the next decade, has sought to revise deals struck with foreign energy companies in the lean post-Soviet years.Asked on Tuesday whether ConocoPhillips would sell its stake in the consortium, Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev told reporters: "They have informed that they have the intention of selling."ConocoPhillips would not confirm its plans for the Kashagan stake. "Unless formally announced by our company, ConocoPhillips does not comment on ongoing business development or commercial activities," spokesman Daren Beaudo said in an email.The Houston-based company, however, has been conducting a disposal program to reduce its non-core overseas assets. It has already exceeded its target of asset sales worth $20 billion by the end of 2012, including the sale of its stake in LUKOIL , Russia's second-biggest oil producer. Proceeds from the disposals are to be used for debt reduction, dividend payments and exploration.Kazakhstan, home to 3 percent of the world's recoverable oil reserves, has moved to exert greater management control and secure bigger revenues from foreign-owned oil and gas developments.Previous reshuffles of North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), the consortium developing Kashagan, have seen state company KazMunaiGas muscle in, prompting Western partners to seek assurances that they will be able to develop the offshore field's more lucrative second phase.KazMunaiGas first entered the Kashagan consortium as a shareholder in 2005 and later doubled its stake to 16.81 percent. Identical stakes are held by Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Italy's Eni and French company Total . Japan's Inpex <1605.T> owns 7.56 percent.The Kazakh state company would have first option on buying the 8.4 percent stake owned by ConocoPhillips, and Chief Executive Lyazzat Kiinov said it was "displaying interest" in buying the stake.Daniyar Berlibayev, Kiinov's deputy at KazMunaiGas, also indicated that ConocoPhillips planned to sell its stake. Whether or not KazMuaniGas would acquire the share would depend on the price, he said."They will exit the project, but nobody has come to us with an offer," Berlibayev told Reuters. "We, as the national company, wouldn't refuse the idea of increasing our share. How we might finance this is another question."Exxon Mobil, the world's biggest non-state oil company, would be a possible buyer of the stake if KazMuaniGas decided not to pursue its interest in the ConocoPhillips stake. Exxon Mobil senior vice-president Mark Albers declined to comment when asked about his company's plans for Kashagan.Kazakhstan, the world's ninth-largest country by area but with a population of only 17 million, expects Kashagan to be one of three main drivers of its plans to raise oil output by 60 percent by the end of the decade.Mynbayev said that Kazakhstan planned to raise output to 130 million metric tonnes (143.3 million tons) by 2020, from 81 million tonnes this year, through expansion at Kashagan, the Chevron-led Tengiz field and the Karachaganak oil and gas condensate fieldKashagan's first phase, which has been delayed by rising costs and technical complications, is likely to pump its first oil by the end of March 2013, the minister said.The first phase of production is expected to yield between 370,000 and 450,000 barrels per day (bpd). A second phase, yet to be agreed with the government, could raise output to 1 million bpd.With output set to begin, consortium members are lobbying for assurances that they will be able to recoup the tens of billions of dollars already invested before the expiry of their 40-year production-sharing agreement, signed in 1997.President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled Kazakhstan throughout its two decades of independence, has already talked to ENI Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni to discuss "cooperation in the oil and gas sector", including Kashagan, his website said.(Writing by Dmitry Solovyov; Editing by David Goodman)	3	3	3	2	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	3

143	crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Forget the leisurely workout. Crossfit training is a high-intensity, no-frills strength and conditioning program to get fit.Used by fire departments, the military, college sports teams and in gyms, Crossfitters tackle an array of physical challenges and follow daily workouts posted on a website."I really do like them in terms of the strength and the challenge," said Liz Neporent, the author of "Fitness for Dummies, said about the exercises." "Why not maximize your time? If you're going to do it, do it. Don't fool around."Crossfit training is the invention of Greg Glassman, a gymnastics coach who opened the first Crossfit facility in Santa Cruz, California in 1995."Crossfit is more of a movement than an organization," Neporent said. "There's a website but it's basically individuals, gyms, and groups doing it."Crossfitters don't say they visit the gym; instead they head into "the box," which is a Crossfit training center for the WOD or workout of the day, which is posted daily."Today I'm doing 100 squats, 100 push-ups, 100 crunches," said Neporent, "which is about half a WOD."A lot of people, she said, would not be able to walk afterwards."That's what you have to understand about Crossfit. For some people it's aspirational."Casey Kirch, an instructor at Crossfit East Village in San Diego, California, believes the timed intensity of Crossfit shows results quicker than traditional strength training."When you're working against the clock you'll work harder," he said.For Kirch, one exercise, called the burpee, illustrates the love-hate relationship Crossfitters have to their WOD.He said from a standing position you squat down, put your hands on the floor, kick your feet behind you. Then you lower yourself to the floor, push up, jump to your feet, stand up and jump in the air. Then you do it as many times as you can."It's a move everyone dreads," he said. "But no matter what someone's fitness level, if they do just a few they'll quickly build up to more. It's immediate satisfaction."A personal trainer for seven years, Kirch has seen too many people give up when they don't see changes soon enough. At his center the sessions last an hour although the WOD might be just 20 or 30 minutes of often grueling intensity. The rest of the time is spent on stretching, warming up and on technique."We don't have machines," Kirch said. "We don't have treadmills or cardio equipment or strength training machines."Rather the so-called box holds squat racks, Olympic barbells, kettle bells, medicine balls, jump ropes, tires and climbing ropes."Most things are based around body weight and barbells," he explained.Proper technique is crucial to safely execute the moves, Kirch said, and most, if not all, centers have a mandatory foundation course."If someone says they've been doing Crossfit at another gym, we'll do a test to make sure they know the movements," he said.American Council on Exercise spokesperson Jessica Matthews said her maiden Crossfit session left her with a major sweat and a pretty strong feeling of empowerment."I like the style," said Matthews, an exercise physiologist. "They focus on foundational, functional movements. They do a lot of total body movements and integrated exercises, such as squats, kettlebell swings and presses. It's an approach I totally agree with."Matthews's session also included a two-lap warm-up run around the block and a few rounds on a rowing machine.Trickier for her is what she calls the "scalability portion" of the Crossfit philosophy: the notion that it works for everyone from the elite athlete to the overweight grandmother."You go for time," she said of the WODs. "We know that when we manipulate intensity by adding variables like speed, people not as seasoned may sacrifice initial base form."She was nonetheless delighted that instead of the tough talk so characteristic of Crossfit websites, which usually promise that butts will be kicked and specialists punished, camaraderie and encouragement ruled the WOD."The environment was intense but not intimidating," she said. "They (her 10 session mates) looked like average people doing the workouts. It's a community. We're all in the box."(Editing by Patricia Reaney and Paul Casciato)	3	2	2	2	2	4	2	2	3	1	3	3	3	1	2	4
144	crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance	SEATTLE (Reuters) - One of Boeing's chief labor unions staged rallies in and around Seattle this week, calling attention to a vote set for Monday that will show whether workers are willing to accept a less generous contract offered by Boeing Co or move closer to a strike.Hundreds of engineers and technicians marched at the company's two plants, its downtown Seattle office and other facilities with signs saying "Boeing: Hands Off My Healthcare" and "We Delivered. Will Boeing?"It was the most visible sign of rising tension over contracts covering 23,000 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. The contracts, which affect two bargaining units, expire on October 6, and a separate vote would be needed to authorize a strike.Though the union is widely expected to vote down the current offer, local officials and analysts consider a strike unlikely, because both sides have so much to lose and workers can keep using the current contract even after it expires.Stan Sorscher, a Speea labor representative and former engineer, estimated the chance of a strike at 35 percent. Scott Hamilton, managing director at consulting firm Leeham Co., said Boeing likely will make a second contract offer and that will restart negotiations."We believe we can get to an agreement," said Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman. "Nobody here is talking about" a strike. "Nobody wants that."Still officials and analysts say it is worrying that Boeing's first offer is going to a vote amid worker rallies.REASONS TO AGREEBoeing has a backlog of 4,057 orders, and is racing to speed up its factories to make more jets, especially 787 Dreamliners, whose customers have been waiting through years of delays.Boeing also is deciding on specifications for a new derivative of its popular 777. And it needs engineers to help repair a number of 787s that rolled off the line with flaws and must be fixed before they can be delivered. While in limbo, the jets weigh on Boeing's financial performance, analysts said."A strike by Speea would cripple Boeing," said Ray Goforth, Speea's executive director. "They cannot deliver airplanes without our members" who are involved in certifying jets before they go to customers.For the union, a strike could reduce its relevance and its ranks, which already are under pressure from retirement of senior workers and outsourcing.Boeing has moved large amounts of engineering work to its suppliers and aims to move more despite the technical problems and cost overruns that resulted from using foreign engineers for the 787. Various engineering groups did not coordinate well, and key pieces, such as wings, did not work well and needed to be re-engineered.Boeing attributes those problems at least in part to flawed execution of the distributed engineering model, not the model itself, and says it will continue to tap engineers from anywhere, even if not from Speea's mostly Puget Sound workforce.Goforth, the Speea leader, said the union could do damage without a strike, by having engineers "work-to-rule" - refusing overtime and following all procedures."Boeing has more rules, regulations and guidelines than any company I've ever seen," he said. "If the employees start strictly complying with all of them, you'd see productions problems immediately and the employees would still be collecting paychecks."Investors and customers could lose in either scenario. Boeing's stock price, which closed at $69.60 on Friday, up 12 percent in the last year, likely would fall, and plane deliveries would be delayed."I hope they resolve it," Tim Clark, president of Emirates airline, Boeing's biggest 777 customer with 75 unfilled orders, said of the labor trouble while in Seattle on Thursday."I hope our orders and those of others help give them a way through."RETIREMENT EFFECTThe two sides face another issue: Age. More than 40 percent of Boeing's engineers will be eligible to retire in five years.These experienced problem-solvers are referred to as the "bow wave," because once they depart, Boeing has relatively few experienced engineers behind them to take over.Boeing actively recruits engineers at all levels. "Our goal is to always retain the best talent and to hire the best talent," Alder said.Yet engineers with experience working on several different jet programs will be harder to find once older workers retire.Engineering skill is "fast dwindling" across the aerospace and defense industries, says Tom Captain, an analyst at Deloitte. "If you go to the website of any aerospace company, you'll see tons of openings for engineers. We can't fill the jobs that we need to fill right now."Using figures from Boeing, Speea calculates that 42 percent of its engineers are age 50 or older, and could retire starting at 55. Among the lower-paid technicians, 56 percent are 50 or older.The recession kept older engineers working - a few are in their 70s and 80s. Now, as the economy improves, older workers will retire, Captain predicts. "The people who are most valuable and able to mentor and teach the younger ones are retiring because of age," he says.Retirees also will push down the average wage of the remaining workers. The union says the average annual engineer income is $110,000. That should fall in coming years, since the average salary of new and re-hired engineers is $81,000, according to Speea's calculations using records from Boeing."Each retiree-replacement is hired at a lower salary than the retiree they are replacing, which drops the average salary of the entire unit slightly," said Matt Kempf, Speea's benefits director.MORE BARGAININGLocal officials say they are puzzled at how the situation has unfolded. Some compare the current tension to 2008, when they say Boeing's Chicago leaders thought the offer to the machinists union would be accepted by members. The members soundly rejected it, and later voted to go on a costly, bitter, 57-day strike."I think Chicago is making the same mistake with Speea," said Hamilton, at Leeham, referring to the company's Midwestern headquarters. He thinks members will strongly reject the contract.Similarly, the union's moves are seen as unusually strident. Boeing's contract offers raises of 3.5 percent every year for engineers for four years. The offer also asks employees to pay more of the cost for healthcare - a concession many workers are making in an economy with unemployment above 8 percent."We would ask them to pay more and the company would also be paying more," Alder said. "Our goal is to maintain the current plan. Any increase in medical costs would be offset by the increase in salary."The union says the contract also would allow Boeing to eliminate medical benefits for retired employees, a charge Boeing denies."Boeing has no plans to eliminate retiree medical benefits for current retirees," the company said. Alder said that questions about wording would have been discussed had the sides stayed at the bargaining table.The union says the tone of the talks changed after commercial airplanes chief Jim Albaugh, a former engineer, stepped down abruptly in June, and was succeeded by Ray Conner, a sales and support vice president. The union says it is now dealing mostly with negotiators from Chicago, rather than local officials that they know.Boeing says the negotiating team is unchanged and the company is eager to resume talks, right after Monday's vote, to agree on a new contract."We'll be waiting on the vote," Alder said. "If it's 'No,' our number one goal is to get back to the table on Tuesday."(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Ed Tobin and Sandra Maler)	4	4	3	3	5	4	4	3	2	4	2	2	1	2	4	3

146	cup-showcase-teams-unprecedented-strength-183558468--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - Fans can expect a high-octane contest between two star-studded teams in this week's Ryder Cup at Medinah where the United States host holders Europe for the 39th edition of the biennial competition.Never before has the trans-Atlantic showdown featured two line-ups bristling with so much firepower and strength in depth, with big-hitting world number 35 Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium the lowest-ranked of the 24 golfers in action.For the first time in two decades, a European team can boast the game's leading player and in Rory McIlroy they possess a man who has already been targeted by the United States."Obviously, he's a marked man," U.S. Ryder Cup veteran Jim Furyk said at last week's Tour Championship in Atlanta. "He's the number one player in the world. He's going to garner all the attention, as well he should. He's played phenomenal this year."(He) won the PGA (Championship) by a ton of shots ... he's right now the present-day Tiger Woods where everyone's eyes are on him."While double major winner McIlroy heads the world rankings, Europe also have third-ranked Luke Donald, Lee Westwood (four), Justin Rose (five), Graeme McDowell (18) and Sergio Garcia (19) among a total of nine players in the top 30.The U.S. counter with 11 in the top 20 - Woods (two), Bubba Watson (seven), Webb Simpson (eight), Jason Dufner (nine), Steve Stricker (12), Dustin Johnson (13), Keegan Bradley (14), Matt Kuchar (15), Phil Mickelson (16) and Zach Johnson (17)."It's pretty phenomenal, really," said Furyk, who this week will be playing on his eighth U.S. Ryder Cup team. "To have 24 players of the top 35 is mind-boggling."We are really happy with our team, it's really strong, but we have our hands full. There's a strong team on the other side and we'll have to play them real tough."Europe have triumphed eight times in the last 13 Ryder Cups but they face a challenging task on American soil where the U.S. have lost only three times since the matches began in 1927."We are playing away and they are going to have the crowd advantage," said European captain Jose Maria Olazabal. "They are going to set up the course to their liking."At the end of the day, we are going to have to play really very, very well and hard if we want to have a chance to win."CLOSELY MATCHEDHowever, Spaniard Olazabal also felt the two teams would be very closely matched."I've always said that I don't see any favourites in this Ryder Cup," he said. "Both teams are playing very strong. The U.S. team is always strong. They have played great."They won the Masters (through Watson) this year. They won the U.S. Open (Simpson). They won a bunch of tournaments. I don't see any favourites at all."Since 1981, there has been very little to choose between the two teams in terms of matchplay grit and ability. The knack of holing putts at the right time under intense pressure has been the decisive factor.The Americans last won the Ryder Cup at Valhalla in 2008 when their captain Paul Azinger shrewdly inspired team cohesion with a four-man 'pod' system and prepared the venue with very little rough and fast greens to suit his power hitters.This week, U.S. captain Davis Love III has set up Medinah Country Club's No. 3 Course in similar fashion."You don't want to see players chipping out (from rough) and putting for par at the Ryder Cup," said Love, who competed in six Ryder Cups. "You want to see birdies. You want to see excitement."We've set it up the way we think fans will like it. We're a long-hitting, free-wheeling, fun-to-watch team. And I think it's going to be fun to watch."Woods, the greatest player of his generation and arguably of all time, missed out on the U.S. Ryder Cup victory in 2008 while recovering from knee surgery. No surprise, then, that he is eager to taste team success this week at Medinah."I've only been part of one winning Ryder Cup team since my (debut) time in '97," he said. "We didn't play well at the right time, and that's just the way it goes. Hopefully this year we'll play well at the right time."The 39th Ryder Cup starts on Friday morning with the opening foursomes matches.(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes; Editing by Frank Pingue)	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	4	2	2	1	4	4

148	czechs-set-first-presidential-election-jan-11-12-092443089	PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs will hold their first presidential election on January 11 and 12 to replace outgoing euroskeptic leader Vaclav Klaus, the speaker of the upper house of parliament said on Monday.Up to now, the country's parliament has chosen the president. But the assembly agreed to hand that power over to the electorate amid calls for more open democracy, fuelled by a growing public perception of cronyism and corruption in the country's political parties.Opinion polls suggest the leading candidates to replace Klaus are former prime ministers Milos Zeman and Jan Fischer, in office from 1998-2002 and 2009-2010, respectively.Both men are much more in favor of closer cooperation with the European Union than Klaus. Both were members of then Czechoslovakia's totalitarian Communist party before the collapse of the Soviet Union.Fischer is running as an independent candidate while Zeman has the support of a leftist SPOZ party, a small splinter group from the center-left Social Democratic party he used to lead.Political analysts say their popularity is another reminder of the public's exasperation with the country's larger, mainstream parties, following a round of harsh austerity measures and sleaze scandals.Czech presidents do not have the executive powers held by the leaders of France or the United States. But they wield significant influence over the cabinet and parliament through their ability to delay legislation and appoint prime ministers and other officials.The office, held by anti-communist dissident and writer Vaclav Havel from 1990-2003, is held in high esteem in the country of 10.5 million people.Senate speaker Milan Stech said an anticipated second round run-off between the top two candidates for the presidency would take place two weeks after the first round of the election.(Reporting by Jan Lopatka; Editing by Andrew Heavens)	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	4	4
149	dairy-products-wont-skinny-evidence-says-180553729	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Adding a couple of servings of milk or yogurt to your daily diet probably won't help you drop any pants sizes, according to a new analysis of past studies.Some research has suggested dairy products may help people feel full for longer, or that the calcium in milk and yogurt can prevent the build-up of fat tissue. But those remain unproven theories."The results are not very consistent," said Dr. Frank Hu, a nutrition researcher from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston who worked on the new review."Overall, I think the evidence doesn't support the claim that dairy products are beneficial for weight loss," he said.Hu and his colleagues analyzed the results of 29 studies including a total of 2,101 participants, some of whom were randomly assigned to add extra dairy to their diets.The set-ups of those studies varied widely, with dairy intakes ranging from one to more than six servings per day and diet interventions lasting between one month and two years. Some studies put participants on a reduced-calorie diet to promote weight loss, while others did not.On average, people assigned to the extra-dairy groups lost 0.3 more pounds - about 0.14 kilograms - than the comparison group, a difference that could have been due to chance. They did lose slightly more body fat - about one extra pound worth.When the researchers broke down the results further, they found dairy products seemed to confer some benefit over the short term when they were part of a weight-loss diet. But otherwise, adding more milk, yogurt and cheese didn't help people lose weight or keep it off, Hu and his colleagues reported in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Angelo Tremblay, an obesity researcher at Laval University in Quebec, Canada, said dairy products may still aid the weight-loss goals of people who aren't getting much milk or yogurt in their current diet."Many studies which are used to discuss the issue were performed in normal calcium consumers… and then it is not so much a surprise to see that there is no effect, or only a trivial effect," Tremblay, who wasn't involved in the new analysis, told Reuters Health."It is always the same story," he said. "If you wish to measure the effect of physical activity, in an already very active individual or active individuals you have more chance not to see any effect."Still, even in dairy-deficient people, adding a couple of extra milk or yogurt servings would only be expected to have a small impact on weight, Tremblay said.The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends teens and adults get three cups of low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt per day. According to guidelines, one cup of milk is also equivalent to one and a half ounces of natural cheese or two ounces of processed cheese.But that has to be incorporated into a generally healthy and balanced diet, researchers said."The bottom line is still energy balance," Hu told Reuters Health.For people hoping to control their weight, "I don't think it's a good idea to add dairy on top of their diet," he said. "If their baseline dairy is low, if they want to increase their dairy consumption, they have to reduce something else," such as sugar-sweetened drinks or less-healthy protein sources like processed meat.Making those healthier substitutions, Hu added, "may not have a direct benefit on body weight, but it certainly may have other health benefits."SOURCE: http://bit.ly/P674Eq American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, online August 29, 2012.	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	2	1	1	4	4

151	data-suggest-us-economy-growing-only-modestly-162509615--finance	WASHINGTON (AP) — A spate of data Thursday painted a mixed picture of the U.S. economy: Demand for long-lasting manufactured goods fell and slightly fewer people signed contracts to buy homes. At the same time, the job market looked a little better.Taken together, the reports suggest the economy is growing only modestly and not quickly enough to spur much hiring."The economy overall has only weak forward momentum," Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a note to clients. "The news from housing may be improving, but manufacturing is struggling now."Most of the data seemed discouraging on the surface. But a closer inspection of the details offered some promise.— Companies cut orders for long-lasting goods by 13.2 percent in August, the Commerce Department said. That was the biggest drop in more than three years but it was largely influenced by a 102 percent decline in volatile aircraft orders. Excluding transportation equipment, orders fell only 1.6 percent. And in a positive sign, orders in a category that reflect business investment plans rose 1.1 percent, the first increase since May.— The overall economy grew at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, much lower than the 1.7 percent the government previously estimated. About half of the downward revision stemmed from the severe drought in the Midwest, which cut overall farm output. But growth also fell because exports and consumer spending expanded at a slower pace.— The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy previously occupied homes fell in August from a two-year high in July. The National Association of Realtors said its index of sales agreements declined 2.6 percent to 99.2. That's just below the reading of 100 that is considered healthy. Still, the index is 10.7 percent higher than a year ago.Economists expect growth to hover near or below 2 percent for the rest of the year. That's typically too weak to create enough jobs to lower the unemployment rate.One report appeared to offer some hope that the job market will improve.Weekly applications for unemployment benefits plunged 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 359,000, the lowest level in two months, the Labor Department said. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell to 374,000.Applications are a measure of the pace of layoffs. When they consistently fall below 375,000, it typically indicates that hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.The weekly figures can be volatile, causing most economists to focus on the four-week average.Economists were mildly encouraged by the unemployment applications. Still, many still expect the government's employment report for September to show only modest job gains, perhaps about 100,000. That's about the same as in August. The September jobs report will be released next week.The September jobs report will be released next Friday.The past few reports on applications for unemployment benefits "suggest no significant acceleration or deceleration in employment growth," said Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics.A survey of chief executives, released Wednesday, found a sharp drop in the number of large companies that plan to step up hiring or boost investment in the next six months. They cited worries over tax and budget policies in the United States and slower growth in Europe and China for the gloomier outlook.Some recent indicators have been more optimistic. Consumer confidence jumped to a seven-month high in September, the Conference Board said Tuesday. Home prices are rising steadily nationwide. And sales of new homes remained near a two-year high in August, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	1	1	1	3	4

153	death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603	(Reuters) - A California jury on Friday recommended a death sentence for a man found guilty of starting a 2003 wildfire that burned nearly 100,000 acres, damaged more than 1,000 homes and led to the deaths of five people, prosecutors said.Rickie Lee Fowler, 31, had already been convicted of arson and five counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of people prosecutors said lived in the fire's path and died from heart attacks caused by the stress of evacuation and threats to their homes."We take capital punishment seriously. We don't seek capital punishment on every murder," San Bernardino District Attorney Michael Ramos said. "It's for those people who are most horrendous murderers, rapists - people like Rickie Fowler."The death sentence recommendation, on which the judge will make a final ruling at a later hearing, comes just over a month before California voters will decide on a November ballot measure whether to repeal the death penalty in a state that is home to nearly a quarter of the nation's death-row inmates.The October 2003 blaze that Fowler was convicted of starting, called the Old Fire, burned in the San Bernardino Mountains of Southern California, eventually scorching 91,281 acres.A 2009 grand jury indictment in the case determined that Fowler, while not the actual killer of the five people, started the fire with "reckless indifference to human life."Prosecutors note that individuals who commit a serious violent felony - like robbery, kidnapping, or arson - that results in death are eligible for capital punishment.Jurors deliberated for 11 days during the trial's penalty phase before returning a death sentence recommendation, prosecutors said.While the death penalty remains on the books in California, the state has executed just 13 people since reinstating capital punishment in 1978. More than 720 inmates sit on death row in California, pending long, expensive appeals.A federal judge halted all California executions in 2006 after ruling that a three-drug protocol used for lethal injections carried the risk of causing inmates too much pain and suffering before death.California has since revised its protocol, but an appeals court has blocked a resumption of executions.Fowler had already been sentenced under California's three-strikes law to 75 years to life in prison for committing sodomy against another inmate while behind bars, prosecutors said.They added that he had prior convictions for rape and drug offenses. Fowler's defense attorney did not respond to requests for comment.(Editing by Cynthia Johnston and Peter Cooney)	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	2	3	3	1	4	3	4	
154	debate-bringing-wolves-colo-goes-us-court-090257050	DENVER (AP) — An argument over whether wolves should be returned to Rocky Mountain National Park to reduce an overabundance of elk is moving to a federal appeals court.The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado will hear the case Thursday.The park often has so many elk that they overgraze on trees, shrubs and grass, leaving other animals without enough food and habitat. Few natural predators are left there, and hunting is prohibited in all national parks, so little remains to keep the elk population in check.The park uses National Park Service personnel and trained volunteers to periodically shoot and kill a specified number of elk. Officials rejected the idea of reintroducing wolves to prey on the elk and control their numbers, saying it was infeasible.They cited a lack of support from other agencies, safety concerns of people who live nearby, expected conflicts between wolves and humans and the amount of attention that a wolf population would require of park officials.The wildlife advocacy group WildEarth Guardians sued the Park Service in 2008, asking a Denver federal court judge to overturn the policy. The group said the Park Service didn't fully consider reintroducing wolves, and that using volunteers to kill elk amounts to hunting in the park, which would violate federal law.The judge disagreed, upholding the policy in 2011, and WildEarth Guardians appealed to the 10th Circuit.Rocky Mountain National Park launched a 20-year program in 2008 to thin the elk herd by shooting a number that varies from year to year, depending on the size of the park's overall herd. The program also includes fencing elk out of some areas to protect vegetation and redistributing some of the animals.Park spokeswoman Kyle Patterson said 131 elk have been killed in the culling program during the winters starting in 2008, 2009 and 2010.The current size of the elk herd in the park's lower elevations is 600 to 800, which is within the target range set by the program, so no elk were killed last year. The park website says weather, hunting outside the park and changes in elk movement patterns have helped keep the numbers low.No decision has been made on whether or how many elk will be killed in the upcoming winter.Wolves disappeared from many parts of the West after decades of hunting and government-backed extermination. They were re-introduced in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in 1995, and some advocates have argued for bringing them back elsewhere.Wolves ignite heated and emotional debates in the West, with some people saying the predators are a threat to human safety and ranchers' livelihoods, and others arguing they are a vital part of natural ecosystems and inspiring to see in the wild.By contrast, the arguments in the lawsuit before the 10th Circuit are largely about dry-sounding procedural questions, chiefly whether the Park Service followed the letter of the law in rejecting wolf reintroduction and whether using trained volunteers to shoot excess elk is "culling" or "hunting."The 10th Circuit normally meets in Denver but will hear oral arguments in this case at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder as part of an outreach program.___On the Web:Rocky Mountain National Park Elk and Vegetation Management Fact Sheet: http://www.nps.gov/romo/parkmgmt/elkveg_fact_sheet.htmWildEarth Guardians "Wolf Den": http://www.wildearthguardians.org/site/PageServer?pagename=priorities_wildlife_wolves&AddInterest=1228___Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	3	1	1	2	4	3
155	debate-promises-kept-163400738	DENVER, COLO. — Forget expectations. Both President Barack Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney walk into their first debate with several significant vulnerabilities that the right question and right answer will either expose or cover. These are domestic policy vulnerabilities, not characterological ones, but they speak to character and mien. We'll start with Obama's trouble spots.1. Mortgages. Why didn't he do more to make whole the nation's record number of delinquencies? Why did he bail out the banks and not force them to use the money (because, you know, he did force them to use the money in certain ways) to settle with homeowners? Why have the administration's own programs been mired in bureaucracy? Why did it take him so long to create an investigatory task force on mortgage fraud? Did he pick the wrong people? If he had done things differently, would the middle class be on a more hopeful trajectory?SEE ALSO: A premortem obituary for Romney is premature2. Raising taxes. Romney's budget-balancing plan is implausible. But Obama's is scarcely more realistic, given his chief constraint, which is that he will not raise taxes on those families earning more than $250,000 a year. If he sticks to that, whatever Congress does, he is going to have to cut spending by a lot more than he currently intends to. The math for his deficit and debt projections doesn't add up unless all of the Bush tax cuts expire. It's also looking like the payroll tax cuts he trumpeted last year may be forced to go away. Taxes on families who make less than $250,000 a year are going to rise.3. Health care. Over and over, Obama reassured those folks with insurance plans they currently like that the Affordable Care Act wouldn't change their health payment arrangements. This was a technical truth that concealed a misdirection. It is very likely that insurance companies, forced to offer new benefits, will raise premiums on plans that are currently affordable; or maybe insurance companies will eliminate certain unprofitable policies, or decide they can't do business with certain companies. It's true that market forces would influence the options offered by insurance companies regardless of whether ObamaCare had passed, but ObamaCare all but guarantees that every major insurance company is going to radically change the menu of plans it offers. Some people might wind up paying less, but some will pay more. Arguably, there is no way around this. Arguably, if Obama had conceded to the American people that ObamaCare would indeed change their insurance policies in the future, the bill would not have passed. I think the White House consciously decided to believe the "technical truth" because the real truth was so politically unpalatable… even though it may have been in pursuit of policies that lead to better outcomes for more people.SEE ALSO: Blame where there is none4. Medicare. The Romney-Ryan charge that ObamaCare slashes Medicare has been dealt with elsewhere, but it is true that many health care providers might decide to pass along the costs they must bear to consumers and some, or even a large minority, may start refusing to see Medicare patients altogether because they can't afford to.5. Jobs. I don't think there's much Obama can do to create jobs in his second term. I don't think Obama thinks he can create jobs without a major bipartisan deficit reduction plan already in place. It remains a vulnerability because his campaign is (properly) bashing Romney for being vague. Obama has a record, and that record is a proxy for his future intentions, but it is not a sufficient answer to the jobs question. On the other hand, I don't know if there is a sufficient answer to the jobs question.SEE ALSO: The president for the upper halfLater: Mitt Romney's vulnerabilities.View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	4	2	3	2	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	3	1	1	3	4
156	deceased-conn-voter-found-alive-cant-break-tie-165052779--abc-news-politics	A Connecticut judge sought to break a tie between two primary candidates for the General Assembly by opening an uncounted sealed ballot in court Wednesday, only to discover that the voter-once thought to be dead-had cast a ballot for a third candidate in the race.The absentee ballot, which many believed would determine the race, was originally set aside by election officials in the belief that the woman was deceased. Some searching revealed that the elderly woman was living in a nursing home and thus was eligible to vote.The hushed courtroom erupted into laughter on Wednesday, according to the Hartford Courant, after weeks of suspense, courtroom drama and fierce debate ended and it was revealed that the vote would remain deadlocked and a new election would still be necessary.Election officials had twice recounted the votes in a Democratic primary for the 5 th General Assembly District, an area that includes Hartford and Windsor, before Wednesday's proceedings.Following the initial count on election night on Aug. 14, candidates Brandon McGee and Leo Canty were tied with 774 votes a piece.According to state election officials, a new vote could have been ordered then if all parties agreed. Instead, McGee demanded a recount, according to Av Harris, spokesman for the Connecticut secretary of state. The results of that count put Canty ahead by one vote, leading McGee to sue.The judge ordered a second recount, resulting in the discovery of two previously uncounted ballots. One ballot cast a vote for McGee, leading again to a tie. The second ballot was marked "deceased" and that was the one opened in court.Judge A. Susan Peck on Tuesday ordered that the name of the voter would not be made public to keep her vote secret. She opened the ballot in court, revealing a vote for Windsor Mayor Donald Trinks, who finished a distant third."The court has to balance the privacy rights of the voter against the rights of the voters of the 5th District to have the race determined," Peck said, according to the Courant."It is pretty ironic," said Harris, whose office certifies elections in the state. "This could have been resolved three weeks after the election with a revote. Now, we're just doing it anyway, only two months later."Judge Peck ordered a new election. Officials say that vote will be held Oct. 2, and only those voters who previously cast ballots will be allowed to participate.	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	2	3	2	3	1	2	2	3	4
157	definition-american-dream-105253284	The siren call of the American dream may not be as powerful as it once was, but we are still a nation of believers, new research shows. Like the American population, the demographics of those who believe in the dream have changed over time. But the majority of us still believe the U.S. is a place where anyone can achieve fame and fortune.In fact, fame and fortune have replaced faith and family as the linchpins of the American dream, a survey of more than 500 U.S. adults over 18 discovered. The survey was conducted by JWT, a marketing communications company.Almost two-thirds of Americans said the dream is different from what it used to be. The country is moving away from traditional notions of the ideal life — one centered around community and family, with religious faith and middle-class values as the guiding ethos — toward one focused on making and spending money and winning recognition, the survey found.While the dream is very much alive and attainable, achieving it is more of a challenge, the survey found. Almost 7 in 10 respondents said the dream became harder to realize for middle-class people in the past five to 10 years, up from 4 in 10 in 2008. And some hold the conviction that white, native-born Americans have the cards stacked against them, even though statistics indicate otherwise.The exceptionalism of the American dream is also being questioned by younger Americans. While a majority of older generations believe the dream is unique, only 4 in 10 millennials hold that view.Despite everything, though, belief in the dream endures, dented though it may be."While the dream is losing its luster, and Americans recognize that it's becoming significantly harder to achieve, the concept endures; 7 in 10 still believe in the idea, not much fewer than in 2008," said Ann Mack, JWT's director of trendspotting.Reach BusinessNewsDaily senior writer Ned Smith at nsmith@techmedianetwork.com.

161	did-cavemen-dentists-074500005	Cavities can be excruciating, and new evidence suggests prehistoric man used a surprisingly sophisticated technique to deal with the pain: Dental fillings. A team of scientists in Italy have identified a 6,500-year-old cracked tooth repaired with beeswax, suggesting our early ancestors knew a thing or two about dental work. A closer look at the findings:What did researchers find?The study, outlined in the journal PLoS One, takes a look at a fossilized jaw bone discovered in Slovenia near Trieste. Of special interest was the left canine, which sported a large crack that "exposed some of the inner enamel and tissues within the tooth called dentin," says Brian Fung at The Atlantic. In other words: It probably caused a lot of pain.SEE ALSO: Proof that Star Trek's warp drive might actually work?And it was repaired with beeswax?Yes. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the ancient filling to be beeswax, while radiocarbon dating found that it was about 6,500 years old. In all likelihood, the procedure was done either shortly before or after the 24- to 30-year-old individual's death. The team could not rule out the possibility that the wax was "added during a funerary ritual," says Rossella Lorenzi at Discovery News, although evidence suggests it was added while the young man was still alive.Why do they think that?The severity of the crack has researchers believing the tooth was incredibly sensitive, and probably caused him a lot of discomfort. For example other teeth had exposed dentin yet no beeswax was applied. That means if the dental work was done when he was still alive, they write, "the intervention was likely aimed to relieve tooth sensitivity derived from either exposed dentin... or the pain resulting from chewing on a cracked tooth." Essentially, it's the oldest "therapeutic-palliative dental filling" found to date.SEE ALSO: The 8-year-old who discovered a $65,000 piece of whale poopWas the cavity caused by eating bad food?Probably not. The "severe wear and tear" on the tooth was probably due to other activities, says Charles Choi at LiveScience. Men, for instance, regularly used their teeth to soften leather or help make tools. "At the moment, we do not have any idea if this is an isolated case or if similar interventions were quite spread in Neolithic Europe," researcher Frederico Bernardini tells LiveScience. The next project for the team will be to figure out how widespread these types of dental practices really were.Sources: The Atlantic, Discovery News, LiveScience, Medical News TodayView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	3	3	4		2	2	2	3	2	2	2	3	2	2	3	4
162	did-mumford-sons-bigger-justin-bieber-171500422	Watch out, Justin Bieber: Babel, the latest LP from the blandly inoffensive English folk rockers Mumford & Sons, is projected to sell as many as 600,000 copies this week — nearly twice as many as Bieber's latest CD, Believe, which has held the 2012 record since its release in June. (Listen to "I Will Wait," the first single from Babel, below.) Over the past year, Mumford & Sons has earned a devoted following in the U.S., but few would have predicted that their CD would outsell new albums by mega-artists like Green Day and Madonna — let alone dethrone the king of tween pop. Why is this unassuming English folk band setting record-breaking sales? Here, four theories:1. Their digital sales are spectacularThe total LP sales are impressive, says Chris Martins at Spin, but there's another key part of the story: Digital sales are booming. It's likely that Babel will earn the second-highest number of weekly sales for a digital album ever (behind Lady Gaga's Born This Way). The success of Mumford & Sons is proof that bands can thrive in a digital-centric music industry.2. They've had an unusually savvy promotional tour"September has been kind to Mumford & Sons," says The Huffington Post. They've spent the weeks leading up to Babel's release doing what they do best: Performing live, including a one-hour show on Live on Letterman. And their biggest recent appearance? A high-profile gig on last weekend's Saturday Night Live, highlighting two well-received songs from the new album.3. They don't rely on singlesThe band may have broken through with "Little Lion Man," a single from their first album, but they've since been able to cultivate fans who "want to hear their complete body of work," says Melinda Newman at Hitfix. Mumford & Sons has more in common with artists like Radiohead or Coldplay, who don't depend on Top 40 or radio support, than artists like Rihanna or Katy Perry, who have built their careers on radio-friendly singles.4. Their music is uplifting"Mumford & Sons is essentially Tim Tebow in an indie-rock context," says Steven Hyden at Grantland. In both music and personality, frontman Marcus Mumford exudes a "wholesome, inspirational" warmth, with lyrics that dismiss cynicism and encourage hope. The band hits "the sweet spot between the rustic introspection of Bon Iver and the rabble-rousing scrappiness of early Avett Brothers," creating an inoffensive, accessible album that has plenty of mass appeal.SEE ALSO: 'Gangnam Style': The 8 best parodies of the viral videoView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	1	3	2	2	1	3	4
163	disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145	MADRID (AP) — It appears on T-shirts and cellphone covers, coffee mugs and wine labels. You can even use it as an avatar in online games.The church fresco of Christ in the town of Borja was for decades a little-known piece of religious art by a minor Spanish artist. Now that it's been disfigured in a botched restoration attempt revealed a month ago, it has found a new fate as a global icon — used to sell products around the world.And Cecilia Gimenez, the 80-year-old pensioner behind the disastrous touch-up, is exploring her intellectual property rights.The fresco depicts Christ with a crown of thorns before crucifixion, in a style style known as "Ecce Homo" (Behold the Man). It stood in peaceful obscurity in the Misericordia Sanctuary since its creation in 1930 — until Gimenez, a longtime devotee of the work, decided it needed to be rescued from flaking caused by the damp church air.The result was so awful that it could only be destined for one thing: worldwide fame.The solemn Ecce Homo quickly took on a less dignified identity, as "Ecce Mono." Behold the Monkey.Gimenez has gone into hiding in her hometown of Borja, about a four-hour drive from Madrid, to avoid countless international media interview requests. The town itself has morphed into a tourism destination for people who want to see her restoration. The crush has been so big that the Santi Spiritus foundation that owns the Misercordia church and sanctuary recently started charging admission: one euro per visitor.Meanwhile, Internet entrepreneurs have quickly moved in to cash in on the phenomenon, printing "Ecce Mono" on a seemingly endless range of products to sell online.Gimenez' lawyers say she has no interest in a cut of what the foundation is charging people to see the fresco. But they are gearing up to put a stop to potential copyright violations of what she created — even though she had not set out to create anything at all."We want to put some order to this anarchy," said Antonio Val Carreras Rivera, one of her lawyers. "You do this little by little under legality, and our job is to coordinate to prevent third parties from profiting. We are at the beginning now, we can't say if she has rights."If the lawyers determine she does, Gimenez could pursue payments from those using the image to sell products, Carreras Rivera said, adding that whatever she earns will go to charity. She's most interested in funding groups that help people with congenital muscular dystrophy, because she has a son with the disorder.While Gimenez' lawyers research her legal rights, the Sancti Spiritus foundation is stuck in its own legal bind about what to do with the fresco. Should it restore the painting to its original state? Or leave Gimenez' image on the church walls? Or try, as experts say is possible, to separate the two?Gimenez herself is thankful for the many messages of support she's received from around the world, her lawyers said in a statement. And she "regrets and deplores that commercial brands are financially exploiting a situation that began in total good faith, and which should be restricted to the human level beyond business or commercial interests," the statement said.The nonprofit Sancti Spiritus foundation plans to seek a second opinion from art experts on what to do about the painting, before getting the view of lawyers, said foundation president Francisco Miguel Arilla, who is also the mayor of Borja, population about 5,000."Everyone wants to solve this, but no one knows the solution," Arilla said.While Gimenez could end up with ownership of what she painted on top of the fresco, the foundation isn't sure who owns the original. It's either the foundation or the 16 grandchildren of the painter. And Martinez' heirs live all across Spain, Arilla said. "This seems like it's going to be a long process," Arilla said.Meanwhile, Borja is trying to cope with its newfound fame. While known for its wine, this is the first time it's ever been a big tourism draw.The influx of visitors hasn't shown any sign of letting up since news of the fresco rocketed around the world, Arrilla said. About 1,000 people paid admission last weekend, and the number of visitors has averaged 100 daily this week. The charge was put in place to cover the cost of additional workers needed at the sanctuary to manage the crowds."I thought this would slow down by now, but we still have a steady flow of people," Arilla said.	4	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	2	4	2	2	2	4	4
164	disney-film-show-mary-poppins-flew-book-screen-191928152--finance	LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The tale of how the world's most beloved nanny, Mary Poppins, flew from the pages of a popular book onto the big screen is the subject of a new film starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, Disney said on Wednesday.The film called "Saving Mr. Banks" began production on Wednesday. It tells of Walt Disney's 20-year pursuit of the film rights to author P.L. Travers' novel "Mary Poppins," Walt Disney Co's movie studio said in a statement.Hanks will play Walt Disney, marking the first time the legendary animator and film producer has ever been depicted in a dramatic film. Thompson will play Travers, who reluctantly granted Disney the film rights while demanding script and character control that clashed with Disney's vision for the movie musical."Mary Poppins" was released in 1964 and won five Oscars, including a best actress award for Julie Andrews in the title role, best original score and best song for "Chim Chim Cher-ee."The story of the magical English nanny who flies with her umbrella has also been made into a hit stage musical, playing on Broadway. The Cameron Mackintosh production was also a hit in London's West End.John Lee Hancock, whose best-known films include "The Rookie" and "The Blind Side," will direct "Saving Mr. Banks." The film also stars Colin Farrell as Travers' father and Rachel Griffiths as her aunt."Saving Mr. Banks" will be released sometime in 2013, Disney said.(Reporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Jan Paschal)	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	4	3	2	3	2	3	1	3	4
165	divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546	SITTWE, Myanmar (AP) — There are no Muslim faithful in most of this crumbling town's main mosques anymore, no Muslim students at its university.They're gone from the market, missing from the port, too terrified to walk on just about any street downtown.Three-and-a-half months after some of the bloodiest clashes in a generation between Myanmar's ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and stateless Muslims known as Rohingya left the western town of Sittwe in flames, nobody is quite sure when — or even if — the Rohingya will be allowed to resume the lives they once lived here.The conflict has fundamentally altered the demographic landscape of this coastal state capital, giving way to a disturbing policy of government-backed segregation that contrasts starkly with the democratic reforms Myanmar's leadership has promised the world since half a century of military rule ended last year.While the Rakhine can move freely, some 75,000 Rohingya have effectively been confined to a series of rural displaced camps outside Sittwe and a single downtown district they dare not leave for fear of being attacked.For the town's Muslim population, it's a life of exclusion that's separate, and anything but equal."We're living like prisoners here," said Thant Sin, a Rohingya shopkeeper who has been holed up since June in the last Rohingya-dominated quarter of central Sittwe that wasn't burned down.Too afraid to leave, the 47-year-old cannot work anyway. The blue wooden doors of his shuttered pharmaceutical stall sit abandoned inside the city's main market — a place only Rakhine are now allowed to enter.The crisis in western Myanmar goes back decades and is rooted in a highly controversial dispute over where the region's Muslim inhabitants are really from. Although many Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations, they are widely denigrated here as foreigners — intruders who came from neighboring Bangladesh to steal scarce land.The U.N. estimates their number at 800,000. But the government does not count them as one of the country's 135 ethnic groups, and so — like Bangladesh — denies them citizenship. Human rights groups say racism also plays a role: Many Rohingya, who speak a distinct Bengali dialect and resemble Muslim Bangladeshis, have darker skin and are heavily discriminated against.In late May, tensions boiled over after the rape and murder of a Rakhine woman, allegedly by three Rohingya, in a town south of Sittwe. By mid-June, skirmishes between rival mobs carrying swords, spears and iron rods erupted across the region. Conservative estimates put the death toll at around 100 statewide, with 5,000 homes burned along with dozens of mosques and monasteries.Sittwe suffered more damage than most, and today blackened tracts of rubble-strewn land filled with knotted tree stumps are scattered everywhere. The largest tract, called Narzi, once was home to 10,000 Muslims.Human Rights Watch accused security forces of colluding with Rakhine mobs at the height of the mayhem, opening fire on Rohingya even as they struggled to douse the flames of their burning homes.Speaking to a delegation of visiting American diplomats earlier this month, Border Affairs Minister Lt. Gen. Thein Htay described Sittwe's new status quo. Drawing his finger across a city map, he said there are now "lines that cannot be crossed" by either side, or else "there will be aggression ... there will be disputes.""It's not what we want," he added with a polite smile. "But this is the reality we face."While police and soldiers are protecting mosques and guarding Rohingya in camps, there is much they cannot control. One group of 300 local Buddhist leaders, for example, issued pamphlets urging the Rakhine not to do business with the Rohingya or even talk to them. It is the only way, they say, to avert violence.Inside Sittwe's once mixed municipal hospital, a separate ward has been established to serve Muslim patients only; on a recent day, it was filled with just four patients whose families said they could only get there with police escorts.At the town's university, only Rakhine now attend. And at the main market, plastic identity cards are needed to enter: pink for shopkeepers, yellow for customers, none for Rohingya.The crisis has posed one of the most serious challenges yet to Thein Sein's nascent government, which declared a state of emergency and warned the unrest could threaten the country's nascent transition toward democracy if it spread.Although the clashes have been contained and an independent commission has been appointed to study the conflict and recommend solutions, the government has shown little political will to go further.The Rohingya are a deeply unpopular cause in Myanmar, where even opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and former political prisoners imprisoned by the army have failed to speak out on their behalf. In July, Thein Sein himself suggested the Rohingya should be sent to any other country willing to take them."In that context, we're seeing them segregated into squalid camps, fleeing the country, and in some cases being rounded up and imprisoned," said Matthew Smith, a researcher for Human Rights Watch who authored a recent report for the New York-based group on the latest unrest.In places like Sittwe, "there is a risk of permanent segregation," Smith said. "None of this bodes well for the prospects of a multi-ethnic democracy."In the meantime, the government's own statistics indicate the crisis is worsening — at least for the Rohingya.While the total number of displaced Rakhine statewide has declined from about 24,000 at the start of the crisis to 5,600 today, the number of displaced Rohingya has risen from 52,000 to 70,000, mostly in camps just outside Sittwe.The government has blamed the rise on Rohingya it says didn't lose homes but who are eager to gain access to aid handouts. Insecurity is also likely a factor, though. Amnesty International has accused authorities of detaining hundreds of Rohingya in a post-conflict crackdown aimed almost exclusively at Muslims. And in August, 3,500 people were displaced after new clashes saw nearly 600 homes burned in the town of Kyauktaw, according to the U.N.Elsewhere in Rakhine state, the army has resumed forced labor against Muslims, ordering villagers to cultivate the military's paddy fields, act as porters and rebuild destroyed homes, according to a report by the Arakan Project, an activist group.In Sittwe, mutual fear and distrust runs so high that most of the 7,000 Rohingya crammed inside a dilapidated quarter called Aung Mingalar have not set foot outside it since June. It's the last Muslim-inhabited block downtown, a tiny place that takes about five minutes to cross by foot.Thant Sin, the Rohingya shopkeeper who lives in Aung Mingalar, said the government delivers rice but getting almost everything else requires exorbitant bribes and connections. There is just one mosque. There are no clinics, medical care or schools, and Thant Sin is worried his savings will run out in weeks.The married father of five has been unable to open his market stall since authorities ordered it shut three months ago. One told him, "This for the Rakhine now," he recalled."All we want to do is go back to work," he said. "The government is doing nothing to help us get our lives back."All four roads into Aung Mingalar are guarded by police, and outside, past the roadblocks of barbed wire and wood that divide the district from the rest of town, Rakhine walk freely — sometimes yelling racial slurs or hurling stones from slingshots.Across the street, a 57-year-old Rakhine, Aye Myint, leaned back in a rusted metal chair and peered at a group of bearded Muslim men in Aung Mingalar."I feel nothing for those people now," he said. "After what happened ... they cannot be trusted anymore. To tell the truth, we want them out of here."Hla Thain, the attorney general of Rakhine state, denied there was any official policy of forced segregation, saying security forces are deployed to protect both sides, not keep them apart. But he acknowledged that there were not enough police or soldiers to make the two communities feel safe, and that huge obstacles to reconciliation remain."We want them to live together, that is our goal, but we can't force people to change," he said. "Anger is still running high. Neither side can forget that they lost family members, their homes."For now, he said, the government is studying every possibility to make life "normal" again. For example: having Rakhine students attend university in the morning, while Rohingya go each afternoon.Thein Htay, the border minister, was more blunt."We may have to build another market center, another trading center, another port" for the Rohingya, he said, because it will be "very difficult otherwise."	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	3	2	3	1	1	3	4	4
166	does-early-voting-damage-democracy-095000507--election	We won't find out who won the presidential race until Nov. 6 (or later), but the election has actually already started. As of last weekend, people in 25 states can already vote through excuse-free absentee ballots or early in-person voting. That means six weeks before Election Day, half the country can cast ballots — and skip the presidential debates, ignore unpredictable world events and hidden videos, and TiVO away the political ads. And a record 35 percent of voters probably will cast their ballots early, according to George Mason University's Michael McDonald. "This is a problem for many reasons," says Matt Lewis at The Daily Caller. Among them: Early voting is expensive for states and campaigns, sends voters to the polls prematurely, and most importantly, "doesn't work." In fact, "researchers at the University of Wisconsin demonstrated that early voting can actually depress turnout" — largely by mitigating get-out-the-vote efforts, and diminishing the civic engagement attraction of Election Day. Could the effort to expand voting opportunities actually be bad for democracy?Yes. Early voting is a "travesty": The first problem with early voting is that it isn't fair, says Ed Lasky at American Thinker. Letting people lock in their votes before the "debates can enlighten voters," ads can educate them, and bad jobs numbers can reflect poorly on the incumbent "is a travesty." Then there's the issue of fraud with absentee ballots. Yet sadly, "few critics have pointed out how damaging early voting can be to our democracy.""The early voting travesty"SEE MORE: The battle over voter ID lawsHuh? Early voting is good for democracy: Most of the opposition's reasons are nonsense, says Jazz Shaw at Hot Air. Absentee-ballot fraud is a myth, the cost issue is either the campaigns' problem or up to the voters of each state, and the study about early voting depressing turnout "relies on torturing the data with so many vague and glossy 'variables'... that it becomes a very murky soup." Besides, as a general rule, opposing "extended voting opportunities is an idea which immediately sets off alarms for me," as it should for anyone who values participatory democracy."Should there be early voting?"Like it or not, early voting may kill Election Day: Early voting is gaining ground — and that's kind of sad for civic engagement, University of Wisconsin political scientist Barry Burden tells the AP. "Before early voting took off, you could go into your workplace and see co-workers with 'I voted' stickers on their lapels," and "your children's school might be a polling place." Election Day was a community and media event, and it was "hard to miss." If early voting eventually relegates the first Tuesday in November to the nostalgia bin, many "people who are on the edge of voting" probably won't cross the finish line."Vote early: Skip the lines, maybe the debates, too"SEE MORE: Are Republicans in danger of losing the House?Read more political coverage at The Week's 2012 Election Center.View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	3	3	4	4	3	4	2	2	3	1	3	3	2	3	4	4
167	does-looking-pictures-puppies-improve-concentration-122200460	Is Monday malaise leaving you sluggish at work? Try looking at photos of baby animals, furtively if necessary. According to a new study out of Japan, so-called cute photos — sleeping kittens, chubby babies, frolicking puppies — may actually increase one's productivity levels. Here's a quick guide to the aww-inducing news:Wait, a study about cute photos?Yes, a team of scientists from Hiroshima University wanted to revisit and improve on a previous experiment which found that people who looked at cute images behaved more carefully — an ingrained response that has to do with an instinctual need to handle babies safely. Building on this, scientists divided 132 university students into three groups and had them perform separate tasks. The first group played a game similar to "Operation" (the board game that challenges you to remove "body parts" from a graphic representation of a body using tweezers, buzzing when you make an error). The second group was asked to find a given number in a random sequence of numbers. The third group took a test designed to measure their level of focus. The members of each group completed one round of their respective tasks; at that point, half were shown images of baby animals while the other half were shown photos of adult animals. The groups were then asked to return to their tasks.SEE MORE: America's first pet-obesity clinic: A guideWhat did researchers find?In all three experiments, participants who looked at pictures of cute baby animals outperformed those who looked at pictures of adult animals (as well as images of neutral objects). In the "Operation" experiment, performance scores among those participants who'd viewed the cute photos improved by 44 percent. In the numbers game, such participants were more accurate, improving their scores by about 16 percent. Researchers concluded that "viewing cute images makes participants behave more deliberately and perform tasks with greater time and care." And this is especially true in tasks that already require carefulness. Viewing cute photos had a positive effect "not only in the motor domain but also in the perceptual domain."How can we use puppy photos to our advantage?The study's authors suggest that incorporating such cute imagery into our everyday professional routines could make people more careful and deliberate in their work. Bosses, however, may need a little convincing.SEE MORE: 8 ways dogs improve your healthSources: Forbes, International Science Times, Wall Street JournalSEE MORE: The phenomenon of grieving dogs: The ultimate loyalty [Updated]View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	4	3	1	3	2	2	1	3	4
168	does-offering-kids-sips-alcohol-turn-them-boozy-104600662	Most parents are anxious to steer their kids away from drug and alcohol abuse. But what's the best way to do it? A new study by public health analyst Christine Jackson of the research institute RTI International, along with colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, found that an unexpectedly high number of mom and dads think they can avoid raising kids who become irresponsible drinkers by exposing them to small amounts of alcohol — a sip of beer, a little wine — at a young age. Is that really a good idea? Here, a brief guide:How many parents believe in introducing their kids to booze in tiny increments?Jackson and her fellow researchers surveyed 1,000 mothers and their third-grade children in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and found that 40 percent of moms believed that forbidding alcohol would only make their kids more rebellious. One-fifth of the moms believed the occasional sip of wine or beer at dinner would "help inoculate young kids against the lurking dangers of peer pressure," says Doug Barry at Jezebel, making them less drawn to experimenting with risky, heavy drinking in their teen years.SEE MORE: The increasing prevalence of new moms sharing breast milk: A guideAre these parents actually giving their young kids booze?Many are, according to Jackson. One-third of the third graders the study examined had already tried beer, wine, or, in some cases, even hard liquor. The study suggests that their parents — at least, those who know about the drinking — think the kids will take the responsible drinking habits they learn at home, under mom and dad's watchful eyes, out into the world. Not so fast, health experts warn.What does early drinking really do to kids?Numerous studies over the last several years have found that "early-onset" drinking is a "known primary risk factor for problem drinking during adolescence," the researchers write. And remember, teenage brains have underdeveloped "brakes," making teens more likely to mimic their peers' dangerous behavior when partying, rather than the moderate drinking styles of parents at the dinner table.SEE MORE: The professor who breast-fed while teaching: Inappropriate?So what's a mom or dad to do?"Try and delay exposure to alcohol for as long as possible," says Ralph Hingson, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's Division of Epidemiology and Prevention Research. Jackson says even a few sips could be enough to put a kid at risk, although some health experts aren't so sure. The most important factor is "the age at which kids first get drunk," says Tim Stockwell, director of Canada's Center for Addictions Research of British Columbia. "That predicted far more than the age at which they first had a drink and I'm thinking that would apply to a sip. All the worries about alcohol are not about sipping."Sources: CBC, Jezebel, Los Angeles Times, TodaySEE MORE: Are older dads more likely to have autistic kids?View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	4	5	4	5	3	3	4	4	4	2	4	2	2	3	4	
169	dog-quickly-takes-nurses-stray-kitten-minn-022833533	JORDAN, Minn. (AP) — A Minnesota woman says she was shocked when her small dog began caring for an abandoned kitten, then started producing milk and nursing the fuzzy gray stray to health.Pat Weber says the kitten was days old when her grandson found it in the family's barn in early September in Jordan, about 40 miles southwest of Minneapolis.She says the 2-inch-long kitten was "ice cold." But she felt it move, so she wrapped the kitten in a warm towel. Then it began meowing — and her 4-year-old Pekingese perked up.The tawny pooch named Mittens began licking the kitten, who nuzzled in and began suckling. Mittens hadn't had puppies in two years, yet she eventually began producing milk. She's been nursing the kitten ever since.Weber calls it a miracle.	3	3	3	3	2	2	1	2	2	1	2	2	1	1	2

171	dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp founder Charles Dolan testified on Monday that it was "quite a reversal" when Dish Network Corp abruptly ended their contract for high-definition programming, a dispute at the center of a long-running legal feud between the two pay TV providers.Dolan, Cablevision's billionaire chairman, was the first witness in the trial in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Voom HD, a former Cablevision unit, sued Dish in 2008, saying Dish violated a 15-year deal to carry HD programming and should pay $2.4 billion in damages.Dish has countered that Cablevision did not invest the $100 million per year in the service it had promised.Voom HD is now a part of AMC Networks, which Cablevision spun out last year. Dish blocked AMC, the company behind critically acclaimed shows such as "Mad Men" and "Breaking Bad," as well as the IFC, WE and Sundance channels from its 14 million customers in July. Media analysts say the trial's outcome could decide whether Dish ever carries the channels again.Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen is expected to testify later in the trial, which is likely to run about a month. Dolan's son, James, who is Cablevision's chief executive and the owner of the New York Knicks basketball team, had also been expected to testify, but a source close to the case who declined to be identified said on Monday he likely will not take the stand.Dolan, who turns 86 this month and rarely speaks in public, testified that he was not aware of Dish being anything less than satisfied with Cablevision's Voom HD programming package.He said he could recall only one criticism that Ergen had with the programming: he did not like a channel called "Rave" that played rock concerts. Dolan said it was known that Ergen dislikes rock music so this did not surprise anyone at Cablevision.In all of his meetings with Ergen, Dolan said the Dish executive was always upbeat and optimistic the HD channels would be successful and Dish even took a 20 percent stake in the venture."We had repeated meetings ... Definitely, (Ergen) was interested ... He appreciated the programming," Dolan said.Dolan also testified that it had been his idea for Cablevision to invest $100 million per year, or half a billion dollars over five years, in Voom HD.A key question for the jury will be whether Cablevision spent $100 million a year on the service.Dish has said that the $100 million clause in the contract pertained to money spent on TV programming only, and because Dish only spent $60 million in this area, the No. 2 satellite provider was allowed to terminate the agreement.Cablevision said that it spent more than $100 million per year on the service, including marketing and overhead costs, as it promised.When asked what the Voom budget had been earmarked for, Dolan said it was widely known that the money would be used on the entire Voom HD business, which included overhead, marketing and salaries.Dolan said Dish broke its 15-year contract with Voom HD to pay it $3.25 per subscriber for the channels in 2008, around the same time that other popular networks such as ESPN began offering HD feeds for free.This made Cablevision "cynical" about Dish's motives in ending the contract, Dolan said."Charlie was realizing he could sell (HD channels) without paying us," Dolan said, referring to Ergen.(Reporting By Liana B.

175	dredd-3d-movie-remake-thats-actually-better-original-150700467	Film critics have begun to judge Dredd 3D, a new take on the popular comic book character (view trailer below) that hits theaters today — and the verdict is surprisingly positive, given the scathing reviews and relatively meager box office elicited by 1995's Judge Dredd, starring Sylvester Stallone. While Sly's version claims a paltry 15 percent of positive reviews on aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Dredd 3D's approval rating currently sits at a strong 77 percent. With Dredd 3D, starring Karl Urban, has Hollywood actually managed to produce a remake that surpasses the original?Finally, Hollywood has done justice to Judge Dredd: This is the "grim and gritty and violent" take on Judge Dredd that comic-book fans have been waiting for, says Edward Douglas at ComingSoon.net. The difference between Judge Dredd and Dredd 3D? The team behind Dredd 3D "really understood the comics and what works about them, which begins and ends with getting an actor like Karl Urban to deliver just the right amount of scowl" as a character "whose brand of justice bypasses the normal judicial system.""Review: Dredd 3D"Stallone's Judge Dredd was bad — but it's still better than Dredd 3D: "Say what you will about Sylvester Stallone's kitschy" performance in 1995's Judge Dredd, says Roger Moore at the Detroit Free Press, at least Stallone "wore the helmet" — in Dredd 3D, "the helmet wears Karl." It may be more faithful to the comic-book source material to keep Judge Dredd locked into a face-obscuring mask, but authenticity comes at a price: The headgear "closes off his performance and masks his charisma." Stallone's foray into the world of Judge Dredd was flawed, but at least it had personality; this "mega-violent satire" only manages to be "mega-boring.""As Judge Dredd, Karl Urban is all helmet, no charisma"Dredd 3D is fine — but it came far too late: "I myself felt like I'd seen too much of Dredd before," says Glenn Kenny at MSN Movies. Dredd 3D is "a far grittier and more capable rendering" of the character than "the really disastrous Sylvester Stallone-starring mangling of the comic" — but its collection of "post-modern sci-fi cliches" feels dated after the 17 years of science-fiction that has been released in Judge Dredd's wake. It's not "a bad movie version of Judge Dredd," but considering the leaps and bounds by which the genre has grown, it's simply "too little too late.""Dredd 3D: Critic's review"SEE ALSO: Boardwalk Empire's season premiere: 4 talking pointsConsensus: Dredd 3D isn't a perfect film — especially for moviegoers who are attached to seeing facial expressions — but this grim, gritty remake surpasses the original.SEE ALSO: Revolution: Has TV finally found the next Lost?View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	3	3	3	2	3	2	1	3	3	1	2	2	2	2	3	4

178	driveable-15th-could-prove-pivotal-ryder-cup-174155699--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - The sprawling Medinah Country Club course outside Chicago is set up so benignly that it should be a shot-making delight at this week's Ryder Cup, with club members even drooling over the chance to play it."This course, with no rough and lots of trees cut down, it's never played easier," Mike Kabarec, a 19-year member at Medinah, told Reuters on Thursday. "I'm looking forward to playing it."First crack goes to 24 of the world's best players as 12-man teams representing the United States and Europe renew their fierce rivalry in the 39th Ryder Cup starting on Friday.Looming as a possible pivotal hole in the biennial event if the potentially driveable par-four 15th, which can play anywhere from 280 yards to 391 yards, depending on the tee box.The hole has been shortened 100 yards since Medinah hosted the 2006 PGA Championship and a pond was placed along the right side of the fairway and green to offer a risk-reward option."Fifteen has obviously changed quite a lot, which I think will make for a good match‑play hole at that stage in the round," said Briton Lee Westwood.Big-hitting American Dustin Johnson looked forward to the challenge."It kind of just depends on the wind. For me, unless it's into the wind, I'm probably going to hit a three‑wood," he said. "I'm just trying to get it just short of front edge or right on the front edge and it all depends on where the flag is, too."I plan on being pretty aggressive on that one."Matt Kuchar said 15 could produce a swing factor in matches."It's an exciting hole," the American said. "That hole has got potential for a drive to be put on the green and an eagle to be made, or a drive you put in the water. There's a lot that can happen."Some normally daring players are expecting to play the hole conservatively, taking the water and the gaping bunker left of the green out of the equation by laying up and relying on a wedge shot for a birdie chance."I think it's an easy birdie laying up, and as disappointing as the fans are going to be to see that, we have to play what's there in front of us and try to shoot the lowest score," Phil Mickelson said. "The lowest score will be shot by laying up."Long-hitting Masters champion Bubba Watson said he could use a four-wood to reach it, but agreed with U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson, who said going for it, or not going for it would be a "game-time decision.""There's a lot of factors that go on with that - wind condition, pin location, how you're hitting your ball that day," Watson said. "There's a lot of things that are going to determine what goes on at that moment."Players expect easier chips from off the green and with some 400 trees cut down last winter, openings could allow them to recover from wayward tee shots in spectacular fashion."There's going to be a lot of birdies out there," said Briton Paul Lawrie, the 1999 British Open winner. "You'll see a lot of chip‑ins this week. There's no rough around the greens. The greens are rolling pretty pure."Watson, a master at shaping approach shots, applauded the set-up."The way they've set it up is built for great golf," Watson said. "It's built for the fans to enjoy the game of golf."You're talking about no rough. Some of the trees are missing, so you're looking at great golf out of the trees when you hit one wayward. Let's see the big hook, the big cuts, over trees, under trees, around bunkers to make birdies."Germany's Martin Kaymer, the 2010 PGA champion, said: "It's going to be a fun three days of golf."(Editing by Frank Pingue)	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	2	4	2	2	2	1	3

180	earth-sun-distance-measurement-redefined-210736036	One of the stalwart units of astronomy just got a makeover. The International Astronomical Union, the authority on astronomical constants, has voted unanimously to redefine the astronomical unit, the conventional unit of length based on the distance between the Earth and the sun."The new definition is much simpler than the old one," says Sergei Klioner of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, one of a group of scientists who worked decades toward the change, which took effect last month during an IAU meetingUnder the new definition, the astronomical unit (or AU) — the measurement used for the Earth-sun distance — is no longer always in flux, depending on the length of a day and other changing factors. It is now a fixed number: 149,597,870,700 meters, which is the equivalent of almost 92.956 million miles.Klioner explained the simpler definition is helpful, for instance, for scientists who formulate ephemerides — tables that give the precise position of astronomical objects in the sky. They utilize the astronomical unit to calculate the motion of bodies in the solar system. [Solar System Explained From the Inside Out (Infographic)]"The broader community of astronomers are able now to better, with less efforts, understand what their colleagues — astronomers who are experts in planetary ephemerides — do and how they produce the high-accuracy theories of motion in the solar system," he told SPACE.com by email.The revision also makes the unit easier for engineers, software designers and students to understand, Klioner and his colleague Nicole Capitaine, of Paris Observatory, noted.At the same time, the redefinition can serves an epitaph to the bygone era when Earth-bound scientists depended on viewing angles to calculate celestial distances.An established unitLacking precise instrumentation, early astronomers relied heavily on angles to calculate the size of the universe. By studying Mars from two separate points on Earth, 17th-century Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini was able to use trigonometry to calculate the distance from Earth to the sun with only about a 6 percent error."Expressing distances in the astronomical unit allowed astronomers to overcome the difficulty of measuring distances in some physical unit," Capitaine told SPACE.com by email. "Such a practice was useful for many years, because astronomers were not able to make distance measurements in the solar system as precisely as they could measure angles."Modern instruments can come within a few meters of exactly determining distances of over 150 million meters, or some 93,000 miles.The astronomical unit eventually came to be defined by a mathematical expression that involved the mass of the sun, the length of a day, and a fixed number known as the Gaussian gravitational constant. Because the Earth orbits its star in an ellipse rather than a circle, the length of a day shifts over the course of a year. At the same time, the sun is constantly transforming mass into energy.In the 20th century, famed scientist Albert Einstein added general relativity to the mix. According to the famous theory, space-time is relative depending on one's frame of reference.The new fixed number is the best estimate of the original expression, Klioner said."If we would decide to continue with the old definition, we would have to add several additional conventions to make the latter meaningful in the framework of general relativity," he explained. "A better way was to change the definition completely — and this is what we succeeded in doing."Capitaine said, "The change of definition of the astronomical unit mainly concerns those in the field of high-accuracy solar system dynamics."Satellites and other crafts traveling in space are not affected, because they rely on set distances."The distance between the Earth and the sun, as any physical distance, should be measured and cannot be fixed by any sort of resolution," Klioner said.The times, they are a-changingCapitaine and Klioner are among several scientists who worked over the last two decades on a revision of the astronomical unit. Capitaine said she first got involved when she gave a presentation in 1994 with Bernard Guinot, also of Paris Observatory. Over the course of 10 years, several published papers by various scientists discussed the ramifications of changing the stalwart unit. The three scientists presented the issue to the astronomical community on a number of different occasions.Other astronomers helped to demonstrate the feasibility of the change before it landed on the table of one of the working groups for the International Astronomical Union. The resolution was reworked several times before it won unanimous passage."The change as we have it now is really a product of collective work," Klioner said.He went on to add, "I think that the energy, commitment, and the worldwide scientific reputation of Nicole Capitaine were crucial for getting this change through."Shifting from a constantly changing value to a fixed number may seem like an easy choice, but the group faced some resistance. Some believed that the overhaul would be too difficult to implement with crucial software, while others were concerned that discrepancies might be introduced into past work. Still others were uncomfortable changing such a historic definition. Eventually, all concerns were apparently met. "Within the last two years, I have not heard a single objection for the change itself," Klioner said.Follow SPACE.com on Twitter @Spacedotcom.

181	easing-german-inflation-still-above-ecb-target-144140032--business	BERLIN (Reuters) - Inflation in the euro zone's largest economy of Germany slowed in September, but not by enough to support the case for a recession-fighting interest rate cut by the European Central Bank.Preliminary data showed annual inflation slowed to two percent on seasonal factors such as reduced food and travel costs, matching a Reuters consensus forecast. The measure fell from 2.1 percent in August when it jumped on energy prices.The European Central Bank aims to keep inflation close to, but just under, 2 percent in the euro zone as a whole."Over the past two to three months, there has not been a trend of price easing in Germany which would catch anybody's attention and influence the debate at the ECB over rates," said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg Bank."The Bundesbank would still say it is at 2 percent, which is the upper limit of where it is allowed to be, so nobody will use it as an argument for a rate cut."For much of last year Germany's inflation rate remained above 2.0 percent, as its economy outperformed that of its peers, fuelling robust wage rises across many sectors.This posed a dilemma for the ECB, struggling to balance monetary policy for Europe's largest economy and powerhouse with policy for the struggling southern periphery.Germany is now beginning to feel more of the pain from the euro zone crisis as weaker demand in austerity-hit countries weighs on exports. A survey on Monday showed business sentiment dropped for a fifth straight month in September, raising fears of a recession.But economists said inflation, which regained momentum in August after briefly dipping below the 2 percent mark in the summer, looked unlikely to ease sustainably any time soon. Energy and food prices, as well as the ECB's policies and a pickup in the economy, all risked fuelling price pressures."We are sticking to our forecasts for inflation of 2.0 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, but we do also see upward risk at the moment," said Thilo Heidrich at Postbank, mentioning oil and food prices, which "could rise due to many droughts in various parts of the world".INFLATION RISKOil prices have shot up since June with international sanctions hitting Iranian exports and the U.S. central bank launching fresh stimulus measures, which tend to boost commodities.Meanwhile, food prices have risen after the worst drought in half a century in the United States and poor crops from the Black Sea bread basket hit corn, wheat and soybean supplies.Berlin and the Bundesbank have hinted they would tolerate higher prices as long as euro-wide inflation remains under control. That could help ailing euro zone countries boost their competitiveness.But a Reuters poll of 41 economists shows data due to be released on Friday will likely show euro zone prices rose 2.5 percent in September.The ECB kept its main refinancing rate at a record low of 0.75 percent at its September policy meeting, and ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure on Sunday downplayed expectations for a near-term rate cut, saying recent economic and inflation data do not justify it and confidence was returning.On a monthly basis, German consumer prices were unchanged in September, according to the preliminary data from the Federal Statistics Office.Consumer prices harmonized to compare with other European Union countries were unchanged on the month and rose 2.1 percent on the year, down from 2.2 percent in August.The Statistics Office's preliminary inflation calculations are based on data contributed by six German states. Final German price data for September are due to be released on October 11, the office said.Inflation had only accelerated in one of the six states, in Baden-Wuerttemberg, for the most part slowing on lower food and travel costs.(Additional Reporting by Klaus Lauer, Editing by Gareth Jones and Toby Chopra)	4	4	3	4	4	5	4	4	2	4	3	1	1	2	4	3
182	ed-zwick-drops-directing-duties-great-wall-221657695	LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Ed Zwick ("The Last Samurai") has fallen off directing duties for the historic epic "The Great Wall," an individual close to the project told to TheWrap on Monday, adding that there was a difference in visions on how to move forward on the project between Zwick and the producers, Legendary East.Legendary East is pushing ahead with the project, however, and seeking a new director to replace Zwick.A decision was made earlier this summer to push the start date of the project from the fall to the spring to avoid adverse weather conditions, and there was some speculation about the future of the project. But financing remains in place for the film, the individual said, and it is moving forward.Zwick has not yet responded to TheWrap's requests for comment.Earlier this year, casting was announced, with a starring lineup that included Henry Cavill and Benjamin Walker. Chinese stars such as Zhang Ziyi are also reportedly being courted for the film.The original lineup of producers for the film included Legendary's Thomas Tull and Jon Jashni, Charles Roven and Alex Gartner of Atlas Entertainment, as well as Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz. It was unclear at press time if Zwick and Herskovitz would still function as producers.The first film for Legendary East, the film is set in 15th century China and follows a group of British warriors who happen upon the wall as it is under construction. They soon begin to realize that there is more to it than meets the eye."The Great Wall" was announced as the first film for Legendary East, a stand-alone company, which is based in Hong Kong and staffed with Chinese employees.At the end of last year, Legendary East terminated a distribution agreement with the Chinese group, the Huayi Brothers, which was due to distribute "The Great Wall" in China.Earlier this summer, Zwick signed on to direct the chess-master drama "Pawn Sacrifice" with Tobey Maguire.	3	2	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	1	1	1	3	4
183	eddie-haskell-brooks-070000152	New York Times columnist David Brooks is the Eddie Haskell of the Fourth Estate. Like the two-faced sycophant in "Leave It to Beaver," Brooks indulges in excessive politeness while currying favor with political authority. He prides himself on an oily semblance of maturity and rational discourse.But the phony "conservative" back-stabber, who has spent the last four years slavering over Barack Obama like a One Direction groupie and trashing the tea party like an MSNBC junkie, isn't fooling anyone.Lately, Brooks has been given to dispensing passive-aggressive advice to GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. His column this week titled "Thurston Howell Romney" called Romney "a kind, decent man" — and then shredded him to pieces as a "country club" elitist who "doesn't know much about the culture of America," "knows nothing about ambition and motivation," and is "running a depressingly inept presidential campaign."Eddie Haskell Brooks, along with fellow GOP bubble-dwellers Peggy Noonan and Bill Kristol, eagerly piled on Romney over his "secret video" remarks contrasting the nation's makers and takers. Liberal outlets embraced these chin-pulling tools — elevating them as "key" Republican voices who speak for the right.Despite the best efforts of the Democratic-professional media complex to gin up faux-rage over Romney's remarks, however, several polls show that voters agree with Romney's fundamental critique of the indulgent Democratic politics of victimhood, identity and dependency. Yep, Brooks has the pulse of mainstream America — direct from his hallowed bubble at the Fishwrap of Record.Brooks shares all he knows about "ambition," "motivation" and the "culture of America" through regular appearances with the insular clique of conservative-bashing snobs at taxpayer-supported "PBS NewsHour." A cursory glance at Brooks' biography shows that he has spent the majority of his life in New York City and Washington, D.C. He has worked for a raft of employers from The Washington Times to The Wall Street Journal to The Weekly Standard to The New York Times.But unlike Romney, Brooks has never actually run a business of his own, managed a massive private entity, governed a state or overseen a campaign for national office.He does have quite an impressive record, though. If by record you mean sucking up to empty suit Barack Obama, mocking grass-roots conservatives as "teens" and defending his cocktail party mates in establishment journalism.In 2009, the liberal New Republic published the bodice-ripping "story behind the Obama-Brooks bromance." The magazine reported that "two days after Obama's 'The Audacity of Hope' hit bookstores (in 2006), Brooks published a glowing Times column. The headline was 'Run, Barack, Run.'"Brooks also recounted his first encounter with his Democratic crush. "I remember distinctly an image of — we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant," Brooks said, "and I'm thinking, a) he's going to be president and b) he'll be a very good president."The purported conservative columnist's public display of affection for the radical Democratic candidate bordered on obscene. "I think he's more talented than anyone in my lifetime," Brooks gushed. "I mean, he is pretty dazzling when he walks into a room." Brooks revealed that he considered Obama's Chicago campaign mastermind David Axelrod a "hero." Axelrod returned the love, calling Brooks a "serious public thinker" in an era of "insipid, instant commentary and one-hour news cycles."In the fall of 2008, Brooks swooned over Obama's Ivy League "achievatrons" taking over Washington: "Already the culture of the Obama administration is coming into focus. Its members are twice as smart as the poor reporters who have to cover them, three times if you include the columnists. They typically served in the Clinton administration and then, like Cincinnatus, retreated to the comforts of private life — that is, if Cincinnatus had worked at Goldman Sachs, Williams & Connolly or the Brookings Institution."Wait, he wasn't not done:"So many of them send their kids to Georgetown Day School, the posh leftish private school in D.C., that they'll be able to hold White House staff meetings in the carpool line. And yet as much as I want to resent these overeducated Achievatrons (not to mention the incursion of a French-style government dominated by highly trained Enarchs), I find myself tremendously impressed by the Obama transition."Less than three years later, Brooks acknowledged he had been an "Obama sap." He admitted that he fell for the administration's stimulus propaganda:"When administration officials called around saying that the possibility of a double-dip recession was horrifyingly real and that it would be irresponsible not to come up with a package that could pass right away, I believed them. ... But of course I'm a sap. When the president unveiled the second half of his stimulus it became clear that this package has nothing to do with helping people right away or averting a double dip. This is a campaign marker, not a jobs bill."Not just a sap. A willing tool, too. Brooks copped to sitting on Obama's private admission to him that the "shovel-ready" promise was a crock. "The projects just didn't exist. They couldn't do it. They couldn't find them," he said on "PBS NewsHour" — more than a year after Obama told him.Gee, Wally, why isn't Eddie Haskell Brooks giving this corrupt administration and its Titanically inept "achievatrons" the business?Michelle Malkin is the author of "Culture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks & Cronies" (Regnery 2010).

185	egypt-tv-presenter-incitement-trial-arrested-185820644	CAIRO (AP) — The owner of a TV station on trial for incitement after calling for the killing of Egypt's Islamist president Mohammed Morsi was arrested on Sunday in connection with a series of allegations, including theft of electrical power and issuing a bounced check, police said.Tawfiq Okasha was not at his Cairo home when police went to arrest him, but he later surrendered at a police station in the eastern suburb of Nasr City, they added.Also Sunday, Justice Ministry officials said an investigating judge referred the last prime minister of Egypt's deposed authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak to trial on corruption charges arising from the decade he served as civil aviation minister. Besides Ahmed Shafiq, the chairman of national carrier EgyptAir and nine other ministry officials were also referred to trial.Shafiq left Egypt shortly after his narrow defeat by Morsi in a presidential runoff in June. He has already been referred to trial on separate corruption charges dating back to the 1990s when he chaired a housing association for air force officers. Mubarak's two sons, onetime heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa, were charged in the same case together with four retired generals.Shafiq, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, was defiant in a comment he posted on his Twitter account after news of his new trial broke in Cairo."I will continue my political work and I will stand up to persecution and the use of law to commit character assassination against me," he wrote. "I traveled after the election to avoid expected persecution. Time has shown that it did happen," wrote Shafiq, who like Mubarak is a career air force officer. He was named prime minister in Mubarak's final days in office.Authorities last month ordered the closure of Okasha's TV station — Al-Faraeen," or "The Pharoahs" — which he used to launch scathing attacks on Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood, the fundamentalist Islamist group from which the president hails. Okasha has emerged as one of the most popular TV personalities of post-Mubarak Egypt by railing against the uprising that toppled Mubarak's 29-year rule in February 2011.For months, he appeared on Al-Faraeen every night to mock the country's "enemies" — everyone from leftists and Islamists to Freemasons and Zionists — with rants full of abuse and earthy humor. In the weeks before a court ordered his station closed, he presented himself as Egypt's champion against a takeover by the Brotherhood, starting an open clash with the group and the new president.It was not immediately clear why authorities decided to move against Okasha now since most Egyptians, particularly celebrities like him, get away with a fine when faced with similar charges. Okasha, according to the police officials, was also arrested over allegations of forgery and disturbing authorities.No details were immediately available on the particulars of the charges.The police and Justice Ministry officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.Okasha is not the only media personality facing criminal charges related to attacks on Morsi or his Brotherhood.The editor of the el-Dustour newspaper, which vilifies Morsi daily, is on trial for "spreading lies" and fabricating news. A Christian man is also serving a two-year prison sentence for insulting Morsi.There are widespread worries among Egyptians that Morsi and the Brotherhood have amassed too much power, holding executive and legislative authorities as well as dominating the process of writing the next constitution.But Okasha does not get much sympathy because many of the nation's key political players see him as a divisive figure. Many secular politicians and activists who distrust the Brotherhood shun him, seeing him as a remnant of Mubarak's authoritarian regime.Some see the crackdown on Okasha and Shafiq as a move by Morsi to eliminate a powerful potential rival in Shafiq, and a vocal critic in Okasha. Like in the days of Mubarak, Morsi's presidential palace maintains that the president has nothing to do with legal procedures against critics like Okasha or the el-Dustour editor.Veteran politician Ayman Nour was jailed on forgery charges soon after he finished a distant second in a 2005 presidential election, the only vote where Mubarak allowed someone besides himself to appear on the ballot. Shortly afterward, the politician who finished third lost the leadership of his party in a power struggle suspected to have been engineered by Mubarak's security agents.	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	2	3	3	1	3	3	
186	egypts-morsi-assumes-major-role-mideast-224446969	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Egypt's new President Mohammed Morsi assigned himself the heavyweight's role in the Middle East on Wednesday, declaring in his first speech to the United Nations that the civil war raging in Syria is the "tragedy of the age" and must be brought to an end.In a wide-ranging address that touched on all major issues confronting the region, Morsi also decried Israeli settlement-building on territory Palestinians claim for a future state and condemned a film produced in the United States that denigrates Islam's Prophet Muhammad.He urged all U.N. member nations to join in an effort to end what he called "the catastrophe in Syria" that pits the regime of Bashar Assad against opposition forces trying to end 40 years of dictatorship. More than 30,000 people have been killed in the 18-month conflict.Morsi has called for Assad to step down and said Wednesday that "the bloodshed in Syria and the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded must be stopped."Morsi, an Islamist and key member of the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood, opened his remarks to the U.N. General Assembly by celebrating himself as Egypt's first democratically elected leader who was swept into office after what he called a "great, peaceful revolution" that overthrew Hosni Mubarak.He then quickly inserted himself into the thorniest issues in the Middle East, demanding that the United Nations grant membership to the Palestinians, with or without a peace agreement with Israel."The fruits of dignity and freedom must not remain far from the Palestinian people," he said, adding that it was "shameful" that U.N. resolutions are not enforced.The Palestinians are expected to again ask for U.N. recognition and formally make application to the world body in November, after the U.S. presidential election. President Barack Obama said when the Palestinians sought recognition last year that Washington would block the move until there was a peace deal with Israel. The focus of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which have been on hold for four years, is a two-state solution that would formally grant the Palestinians the rights of an independent country.In his bid to end the violence in Syria, Morsi has invited Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia to join a contact group, though the Saudis have not yet participated and the fighting in Syria continues unabated. While Morsi wants Assad to step aside, he said Wednesday that he opposes any foreign military intervention.The U.N. Security Council, which could call for intervention or global sanctions against Syria, is deadlocked because Russia, Assad's main protector, and China have blocked a series of resolutions brought by Western governments.Morsi also denounced as an obscenity the anti-Islam video that portrays the Prophet Muhammad as a womanizer, a child molester and a fraud, insisting that freedom of expression does not allow for attacks on any religion.He also condemned the violence that swept Muslim countries last week in reaction to the video. At least 51 people were killed, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans targeted in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi."Egypt respects freedom of expression. One that is not used to incite hatred against anyone. One that is not directed toward one specific religion or culture. A freedom of expression that tackles extremism and violence. Not the freedom of expression that deepens ignorance and disregards others," Morsi said.He appeared to have been responding to Obama's General Assembly speech Tuesday in which the U.S. leader again condemned the video but sternly defended the U.S. Constitution's free speech guarantees.In Cairo, Egyptians watched Morsi's speech closely for signs of how he would conduct his presidency. Abdel-Mohsen, a 31-year architect, praised Morsi's condemnation of the Assad regime, but questioned his assertions about free speech."How can he talk about freedom of expression when there are many protesters in detention in Egypt, including minors, and when people are locked up for the so-called contempt of religion?" she said.The head of the Arab League, meanwhile, called for the international community to criminalize blasphemy, warning that insults to religion pose a serious threat to global peace and security.Nabil Elaraby's comments to a special session of the U.N. Security Council put him at direct odds with the United States and its Western allies, which are resolutely opposed to restrictions on freedom of expression. However, Elaraby said that if the West has criminalized acts that result in bodily harm, it must also criminalize acts that cause "psychological and spiritual harm."Earlier Wednesday, Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, known for past fiery denunciations of the United States and Israel, spoke at length about his vision for a new world order without the "hegemony of arrogance."Of Israel, he cited what he termed the "continued threat by the uncivilized Zionists to resort to military action against our great nation."The U.S. delegation boycotted Ahmadinejad's speech in response to the "paranoid theories and repulsive slurs against Israel" included in a separate address delivered by the Iranian president on Monday."It's particularly unfortunate that Mr. Ahmadinejad will have the platform of the U.N. General Assembly on Yom Kippur, which is why the United States has decided not to attend," Erin Pelton, spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission to the U.N., said in a statement.Thousands of protesters in yellow vests emblazoned with photos of Iranian dissidents they said were killed by the Iranian regime gathered outside U.N. headquarters during the Iranian leader's speech. Speakers included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-NY, and former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.In his speech on Wednesday, Ahmadinejad did not refer to Iran's nuclear program. Israel and Western nations contend that Tehran is using what it insists is a peaceful nuclear program as a cover for developing the ability to build atomic weapons.Tough sanctions have been imposed on Iran as punishment for its failure to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency to prove the peaceful nature of its drive to enrich uranium to levels that could be used to build a nuclear weapon.Israel has threatened a military strike against Iranian nuclear installations, but Obama insists there is still time to solve the dispute through diplomacy. He has vowed, however, to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear arsenal.Outside the U.N., Alex Mohammed, 40, a restaurant manager from Chicago, stood next to a mock jail cell with a noose next to it, and a cartoon of Ahmadinejad standing under a series of hanged Iranians' legs and the inscription: "We don't have political prisoners in Iran — anymore.""It's getting worse in Iran, because the dictator is taking away more freedoms, including freedom of speech, and jailing journalists," said Mohammed, who has family in Tehran.___Associated Press writers Maggie Fick and Sarah El Deeb in Cairo, Verena Dobnik in New York, and David Stringer and Ron DePasquale at the United Nations contributed to this report.	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	4	3	2	3	4	4
187	egypts-mursi-appoints-intelligence-chief-154646540	CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt President Mohamed Mursi appointed a new national intelligence chief on Wednesday to replace Mourad Mwafi, who was sent into retirement after an attack that left 16 border guards dead in Sinai last month.Mohamed Shehata, already named as Mwafi's temporary replacement following the August 5 attack, was given the post on a permanent basis, the president said in a statement.The decision to retire Mwafi was seen by many as a major step to entrench Mursi's power after he took office on June 30.Mursi's election win ended more than a year of interim army rule that followed the overthrow of president and former air force commander Hosni Mubarak. He later removed the country's top two generals from their positions.A powerful security apparatus suppressed Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood during Mubarak's three-decade rule.(Reporting by Tamim Elyan; editing by Andrew Roche)	2	2	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	1	1	1	2	4
188	egypts-president-morsi-debuts-un-051808524	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Egypt's new President Mohammed Morsi debuts at the United Nations on Wednesday with a speech that will be closely watched by world leaders for clues about his democratic intentions and plans for lifting his country out of crippling poverty.Morsi, an Islamist and key figure in the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood, is the first democratically elected leader of the ancient land at the heart of the Arab world, and was sworn in June 30.He is one of a pair of Arab leaders who will be making their first appearances at the U.N. General Assembly's annual ministerial meeting after being swept into power in the Arab Spring revolutions. Also taking the podium will be Yemen's President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who took office in February after more than a year of political turmoil and is now trying to steer the country's transition to democracy.The Egyptian leader previewed his General Assembly remarks in a speech delivered Tuesday at former President Bill Clinton's Global Initiative. Addressing the violence that raged across the Muslim world in response to a video produced in the U.S. that denigrated Islam's Prophet Muhammad, Morsi said freedom of expression must come with "responsibility."He appeared to have been responding to President Barack Obama's General Assembly speech earlier Tuesday in which the U.S. leader again condemned the video but sternly defended the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of free speech.At least 51 people were killed in violence that erupted last week in Muslim countries, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans targeted in an attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.Morsi did not explain what limitations he felt should be placed on free speech but said the video and the violent reaction to it demanded "reflection." He said freedom of expression must be linked with responsibility, "especially when it comes with serious implications for international peace and stability."Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, known for past fiery denunciations of the United States and Israel, will be making his last speech at the world body as he finishes a second and last term as president.Ahmadinejad took aim at both the United States and Israel while addressing a high-level U.N. meeting promoting the rule of law Monday, accusing Washington of shielding what he called a nuclear-armed "fake regime." His remarks prompted a walkout by Israel's U.N. Ambassador Ron Prosor.And in an Associated Press interview Tuesday, the Iranian leader pressed his argument against the United States."God willing, a new order will come together and we'll do away with everything that distances us," Ahmadinejad said. "Now even elementary school kids throughout the world have understood that the United States government is following an international policy of bullying." He said, "Bullying must come to an end. Occupation must come to an end."Also Wednesday members of the U.N. Security Council will be called to order at an open ministerial meeting by Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, whose country holds the council's rotating presidency, to discuss "change in the Arab world."With no sign of an end to the Security Council's paralysis over intervening to end the raging Syrian civil war, Germany's U.N. Ambassador Peter Wittig said his country chose to focus the council's ministerial session on something new and positive in the Mideast — "the emergence of the Arab League as a regional actor that has proved to be essential for conflict resolution."The 21-member Arab League has shaken off decades of near total submission to the will of the region's leaders and is seeking to transform itself after the seismic changes brought about by the Arab Spring. The league has supported the rebels who ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and suspended Syria in response to President BasharAssad's brutal crackdown against his opponents."This organization is promoting the values that the United Nations is standing for — human rights, rule of law, democracy, pluralism," the fight against corruption and promoting economic opportunity, Wittig said.Also Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the African Union and France have called a ministerial meeting on unrest in Africa's Sahel region. It will spotlight the worsening security and humanitarian situation in northern Mali, which fell to al-Qaeda-linked Islamists after a March coup.Mali and a West African bloc are seeking U.N. support for an intervention force that would consist of aerial support and five battalions, or about 3,000 troops, to help recover the northern territory. But the Security Council wants the Economic Community of West African States, known as ECOWAS, to consult more widely, present more detailed proposals, and exhaust all prospects for negotiations. Wittig has said the Mali request will be discussed at a later date..	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	2	3	3

190	einsteins-brain-now-interactive-ipad-071504000	CHICAGO (AP) -- The brain that revolutionized physics now can be downloaded as an app for $9.99. But it won't help you win at Angry Birds.While Albert Einstein's genius isn't included, an exclusive iPad application launched Tuesday promises to make detailed images of his brain more accessible to scientists than ever before. Teachers, students and anyone who's curious also can get a look.A medical museum under development in Chicago obtained funding to scan and digitize nearly 350 fragile and priceless slides made from slices of Einstein's brain after his death in 1955. The application will allow researchers and novices to peer into the eccentric Nobel winner's brain as if they were looking through a microscope."I can't wait to find out what they'll discover," said Steve Landers, a consultant for the National Museum of Health and Medicine Chicago who designed the app. "I'd like to think Einstein would have been excited."After Einstein died, a pathologist named Thomas Harvey performed an autopsy, removing the great man's brain in hopes that future researchers could discover the secrets behind his genius.Harvey gave samples to researchers and collaborated on a 1999 study published in the Lancet. That study showed a region of Einstein's brain — the parietal lobe — was 15 percent wider than normal. The parietal lobe is important to the understanding of math, language and spatial relationships.The new iPad app may allow researchers to dig even deeper by looking for brain regions where the neurons are more densely connected than normal, said Dr. Phillip Epstein, a Chicago-area neuroscientist and consultant for the museum.But because the tissue was preserved before modern imaging technology, it may be difficult for scientists to figure out exactly where in Einstein's brain each slide originated. Although the new app organizes the slides into general brain regions, it doesn't map them with precision to an anatomical model."They didn't have MRI. We don't have a three-dimensional model of the brain of Einstein, so we don't know where the samples were taken from," said researcher Jacopo Annese of the Brain Observatory at the University of California, San Diego. What's more, the 1-inch-by-3-inch Einstein slides on the app represent only a fraction of the entire brain, Annese said.Annese has preserved and digitized another famous brain, that of Henry Molaison, who died in 2008 after living for decades with profound amnesia. Known as "H.M." in scientific studies, Molaison participated during his life in research that revealed new insights on learning and memory.A searchable website with images of more than 2,400 slides of Molaison's entire brain will be available to the public in December, Annese said."There will be another Einstein and we'll do it like H.M.," Annese predicted. For now, he said, it's exciting that the Einstein brain tissue has been preserved digitally before the slides deteriorate or become damaged. The app will spark interest in the field of brain research, just because it's Einstein, he said."It's a beautiful collection to have opened up to the public," Annese said.Some may question whether Einstein would have wanted images of his remains sold to non-scientists for $9.99."There's been a lot of debate over what Einstein's intentions were," museum board member Jim Paglia said. "We know he didn't want a circus made of his remains. But he understood the value to research and science to study his brain, and we think we've addressed that in a respectful manner."Paglia said the app could "inspire a whole new generation of neuroscientists."Proceeds from sales will go to the U.S. Department of Defense's National Museum of Health and Medicine in Silver Spring, Md., and to the Chicago satellite museum, which is set to open in 2015 with interactive exhibits and the museum's digital collections.___Online:Einstein brain app: http://bit.ly/QeQSnu___AP Medical Writer Carla K.

191	electrons-elusive-hideouts-imaged-first-time-190424749	For the first time, scientists have peered down to the level of a single electron and observed quantum states that had only been theorized before.Researchers imaged the magnetic orbits of electrons called Landau levels, which were predicted in 1930 by Nobel Prize winner Lev Landau. These orbits represent the curved paths electrons travel when exposed to very strong magnetic fields.Previously, scientists had confirmed the levels exist by measuring the changes in electric current that result when electrons switch from one Landau level to another. However, no one has been able to see these levels until now."We are the first to have actually done what's called scanning tunneling microscopy and really look at individual states," said physicist Rudolf Roemer of England's University of Warwick. Roemer was a member of the research team, led by Koichi Hashimoto of Japan's Tohoku University, that reported the achievement in a paper published in the Sept. 14 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters.Tinier circlesWhen charged particles, such as electrons, are put inside a magnetic field, they travel along curved paths, ultimately making a circle. As the magnetic field gets stronger and stronger, these circles get smaller and smaller. The smallest possible circles for the electrons to travel in are the Landau levels. [Tiny Grandeur: Stunning Photos of the Very Small]To image these levels, the physicists looked at electrons on the surface of a semiconductor material. Then they used scanning tunneling spectroscopy to look for the possible locations of electrons.This technique images a sample by allowing electrons to try to pass into it at different locations. If the location contains a feasible state for an electron, the particle will be able to jump into that state through a process called tunneling, confirming that it exists; if the location does not hold a potential electron state, there's nowhere for the electron to tunnel into. In the resulting image, light areas represent the locations of possible states, while black spots show the lack of electron states.The pictures produced byHashimoto and his team look remarkably like theoretical simulations predicted they would."I was very much hoping it would come out like that, and of course we were surprised the agreement was so good," Roemer told LiveScience. "The agreement is even quantitatively so good."Such images were never possible to make before because scanning tunneling spectroscopy has never been so advanced. Each pixel in the team's pictures represents more than a half-hour of data taking, Roemer said."You really have to have a very good experimental setup, and you have to have lots of time," he said.Redefining the kilogramAnd Landau levels aren't just an esoteric curio. They could be put into practical use to help redefine the kilogram, the fundamental unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). While most SI units are defined by relations between fundamental constants that can be reproduced anywhere to derive the correct value, the kilogram is currently defined by a golf ball-size lump of metal kept in a vault in France.Scientists want to change that by defining the kilogram in terms of the weight it would take to counterbalance an electromagnetic force produced by a magnetic coil. The strength of this force is partly dependent on the von Klitzing constant, which is itself linked to Landau levels."Imaging Landau levels doesn't help set up the balance, but it strengthens the understanding of the underlying theory we have, that the von Klitzing constant is a universal constant, and it tells us it's really true," Roemer said. "We can look at these states and really find them there."Follow Clara Moskowitz on Twitter @ClaraMoskowitz or LiveScience @livescience.

192	elitist-touch-media-complain-romney-not-regular-guy-233110359	Only our totally unbiased watchdog media could turn the burning of U.S. embassies in countries where Barack Obama had recently supported mob revolts into Mitt Romney's blunder. Journalists couldn't risk having Obama's campaign slogan "Osama is dead" being amended with "and so is our ambassador."After our ambassador to Libya was murdered in a preplanned, coordinated attack on our embassy last week, preceded by an attack on our embassy in Egypt (and followed by attacks on our embassies in Yemen, Indonesia, Tunisia and Lebanon), Romney criticized the Obama administration for "sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt."He was referring to a statement put out by our Cairo embassy before the ambassador's murder, criticizing an American filmmaker whose YouTube trailer was the alleged provocation for the attacks. Attacks that happened to occur on the anniversary of 9/11.The NFM (Non-Fox Media) uniformly denounced Romney's criticism and pronounced his campaign finished.The Obama administration insisted that Romney had his "facts" wrong: Obama had absolutely nothing to do with the statement -- the embassy staff was freelancing -- and, even if the White House had approved it, it was a good statement because the riots were caused by the movie trailer, and furthermore, the embassy statement was issued before the riots even began.This is known as an argument in the alternative: "I didn't break into that house, and if I did, I didn't steal the silver, and if I did, I only got twenty bucks for it."If the statement were issued before our embassy in Cairo was attacked, then what was the administration responding to? Does the White House make it a practice to put out statements condemning random, barely viewed YouTube videos? The White House officially endorses that cute video of Kooky82's cat attempting to meow the national anthem.The embassy's statement was obviously responding to something, and if anyone in the administration -- even that rogue embassy official! -- knew the Internet video was upsetting our dear Muslim friends, why on earth weren't our embassies protected?Next, the Obama administration detained the American filmmaker and asked Google to block the allegedly offending video. (Take the week off, First Amendment.)This behavior made it difficult for even the most obsequious journalist to keep railing against Romney for suggesting that Obama was acquiescing to angry Muslims. So the NFM's harangue against Romney was deposited in the same filing cabinet where the paperwork to close Gitmo is currently stored.Now, a week later, Romney has said something, again. (Damn him!) This provoked another round of hysterical denunciations from the media.At a private gathering, Romney told donors that Obama had a lock on the 47 percent of voters "who pay no income tax" and "believe the government has a responsibility to care for them." This was deeply offensive to people who pay no income tax and believe the government has a responsibility to care for them.But no matter how much the media belch out the usual cliches -- out of touch, insensitive, racist, not one of us, Thurston Howell, etc. etc. -- all most people heard was: FORTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF AMERICANS PAY NO INCOME TAX?A friend of mine who spent time in Russia during the '70s told me that whenever a Russian would bring up the extensive coverage of Watergate, he'd sigh, thinking he'd have to explain that the American political system was not as corrupt as the commissars would have it. But all they ever wanted to ask him was: "Do all Americans have such nice shoes?"The lesson is: You can't always control what the audience notices.Thanks to the myopia of our one-party media, most journalists are firmly convinced that voters will be appalled by Romney's description of 47 percent of Americans as supporting Obama because they pay no income tax. (Yes, head-up-their-butts journalists in the charming little burg of Manhattan are complaining that Romney isn't connecting with ordinary people.)But the only people shocked by Romney's statement of fact are those who would never vote Republican under any circumstances. Everyone else is saying, "Is it really as high as 47 percent?" -- as the media impotently shouts, "No, you idiot! That's not the point!"There's going to come a time, in the not-distant future, when it's 51 percent paying no income tax. And when that happens, the party of big government will never lose another election. America will become indistinguishable from Western European nanny states -- except there will be no America to protect us.The media happen to love the party of big government with all their heart, so from now until the election, no matter what Romney says, they plan to be scandalized.COPYRIGHT 2012 ANN COULTER	3	3	2	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	3	1	3	3	4

They coordinated song choices by phone and got together to rehearse for a little more than a day before recording the show earlier this month.It was a crash course in catalog consumption and the chance to get to know each other."They're great harmony (singers) and they've got this great driving groove with a minimalist instrumentation," Harris said. "But they just sound good and the songs have beautiful melodies and I love harmonizing on them."She said it proves her theory that music is going to keep reinventing itself in good ways."You don't have to repeat the past. We learn from the past, but we have to come forward with something different and there are just so many different combinations to make good music that touches people," she said.Harris, 65, was among the gateway artists who helped Mumford and bandmates Ben Lovett, Ted Dwane and Winston Marshall discover their love for American roots music. It started with the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack. Harris appeared with Gillian Welch and Alison Krauss on the memorable song "Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby." That eventually led them to the Old Crow Medicine Show and then deep immersion in old-timey sounds from America's long-neglected past.They ran across Harris' imprint many times along the way, and with the help of dobro master Jerry Douglas, they help explore that legacy on the show."Pretty much every song that Emmylou has sung on is my favorite song of whichever artist she sang with," Mumford said. "I'm like an obsessive Emmylou Harris freak and I'm not ashamed."In turn, the quartet has helped shine a light on the influence Harris and the extensive roots underground still exerts. The band, which releases their new album, "Babel," this week, were a growing success story in that community when they appeared on the 2011 Grammy Awards with Bob Dylan and the Avett Brothers, launching Mumford & Sons into the national popular consciousness. Their album "Sigh No More" is now double platinum and "Babel" is one of the year's most anticipated albums."For us, it's kind of a bit of a dream come true," Dwane said. "We'd never thought we'd get to travel so extensively, meet our heroes and collaborate with so many people. ... We're just having a really nice time."Like the band, fans have discovered something new in those old sounds. Mumford & Sons routinely drew 10,000 and more fans on their Gentleman of the Road tour across the U.S. this summer, almost all of them dancing along to Marshall's banjo."Folk music has always been there, but it's wonderful to see the infusion of freshness and energy, but still having that passion," Harris said. "Not just mimicking what went before, but infusing it. I was joking about the banjo, but I'm serious."___Online:http://emmylouharris.comhttp://mumfordandsons.com___For the latest country music news from the Associated Press: http://twitter.com/AP_Country.

199	endeavour-lands-la-airport-aerial-tour-201706171	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Space shuttle Endeavour landed safely at the Los Angeles International Airport Friday after a whirlwind aerial tour around California landmarks.Strapped to the back of a 747 jumbo jet, the pair touched down around 1 p.m. after a nearly five-hour flyover. One of the crew members stuck an American flag out of the hatch of the jet.The flyover took Endeavour over the state Capitol, Golden Gate Bridge, Hollywood Sign and other icons en route to the Los Angeles airport, where the shuttle will be prepped for a slow-speed journey to its museum home next month.At the Santa Monica Pier, spectators pointed their cameras skyward and some chanted, "USA! USA!" as Endeavour swooped along the coast."Even though it was a few seconds, it was a unique experience to witness history," said Andrew Lerner, 23, of Santa Monica.Thousands of spectators jammed rooftop buildings and streets in Sacramento, cheering as Endeavour made two loops around the state Capitol. A crowd of schoolchildren squealed in delight during the second flyover.Matthew Montgomery took a break from his work as a legislative aide and brought his 2-year-old son, Tavion, to see Endeavour airborne."I was going to leave him in daycare but thought this is a once-in-a-lifetime deal," said Montgomery, whose aunt was an engineer on the early Apollo missions.Since Endeavour buzzed by some of the Golden State's most iconic sights, law enforcement and transportation authorities warned motorists not to "gawk and drive.""We want people to take in this majestic show," Los Angeles police Cmdr. Scott Kroeber said earlier this week. "But if you're driving, please drive and don't try to take in the show simultaneously."Traffic came to a near stop along a freeway near the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory east of Los Angeles when motorists pulled off to the shoulder to watch. California Highway Patrol officers came through and blared on loud speakers for people to move on.Extra officers were on duty along the freeways near the airport to make sure traffic flowed smoothly as the shuttle zoomed overhead.Endeavour returned to its birthplace Thursday after an emotional cross-country ferry flight that made a special flyover of Tucson, Ariz., to honor its last commander, Mark Kelly, and his wife, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.NASA's shuttle fleet, which retired last year after three decades of flight, was assembled in Palmdale near Edwards Air Force Base where Endeavour took off Friday morning for the aerial tour. The military outpost 100 miles north of Los Angeles served as the original shuttle landing strip and remained a backup site in case of stormy weather at Cape Canaveral, Fla."We're so excited to be welcoming Endeavour home in grand style with these flyovers," Jeffrey Rudolph, president of the California Science Center, said earlier this week.The youngest shuttle, Endeavour replaced Challenger, which blew up during liftoff in 1986. NASA lost another shuttle, Columbia, in 2003 when it disintegrated during re-entry. Fourteen astronauts were killed.During 25 missions, Endeavour spent 299 days in space and orbited Earth nearly 4,700 times, racking up 123 million miles.On its maiden flight in 1992, a trio of spacewalking astronauts grabbed a stranded communications satellite in for repair. It also flew the first repair mission to the Hubble Space Telescope to fix a faulty mirror. But most of its flights ferried cargo and equipment to the International Space Station, which is near completion.Under White House orders to explore beyond low-Earth orbit, NASA is hitching rides on Russian rockets to the orbiting laboratory until private companies can provide regular service.Endeavour is the second of three remaining shuttles to head to its retirement home. In April, Discovery arrived at the Smithsonian Institution's hangar in Virginia. Atlantis, which closed out the shuttle program, will stay in Florida where it will be towed a short distance to the Kennedy Space Center's visitor center in the fall.Endeavour will remain at an airport hangar for several weeks as crews ready the shuttle for its own road trip. Unlike Atlantis, it will creep through city streets to the California Science Center near downtown.Some 400 trees will be cleared along the 12-mile route to make room, a move that has riled some residents in affected neighborhoods. Museum officials have pledged to replant double the number of chopped trees.___Associated Press writers Tom Verdin and Juliet Williams in Sacramento contributed to this report.

202	eu-moves-step-closer-non-russia-gas-134041279--finance	BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe moved a step closer to loosening Russia's grip on European Union energy supplies after Italy, Albania and Greece signed an agreement supporting the construction of a pipeline to deliver gas from Azerbaijan.At a ceremony in New York on Thursday, the three countries signed a memorandum of understanding bringing the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) closer to reality, although building was not likely to commence until 2014 or 2015.The deal improves TAP's chances against Nabucco West, the other remaining contender in the race to become the first pipeline to deliver Azeri gas to Europe, diversifying the supply. Nabucco West would run from the Turkish border via a northerly gas hub in Austria while TAP would link to Europe via Italy.TAP's managing director Kjetil Tungland called the agreement "a testament to TAP's commercial and technical strengths" and the European commissioner for energy, Guenther Oettinger, said it represented a significant breakthrough."This is another important step towards our aim to get gas directly from the Caspian region," Oettinger said on Friday.Nabucco West spokesman Christian Dolezal said Nabucco still had "the most advanced legal framework" and therefore remained in a strong position to challenge TAP. "We consider this a benchmark in the Southern Corridor," he said.BID TO DIVERSIFY SUPPLIESThe Southern Corridor is the Commission's name for whichever project is selected to help wean the continent off its dependence on Russia, which supplies more than 30 percent of all EU gas imports, including nearly 100 percent in six EU states.Tension between the European Union and Russia over energy has flared repeatedly and worsened since the Commission, the EU's executive, announced this month that it was investigating suspected anti-competitive practices by Gazprom , Russia state-controlled gas monopoly.In its bid for diversification, the Commission says it does not favor any particular project, insisting that its aim is only to make gas supplies more secure and competitive.Whether TAP or Nabucco West wins depends on the consortium of companies that operates the Azeri field that will supply the gas, known as Shah Deniz II.The consortium, led by BP , Statoil , Socar, Total and ENI , is expected to take a decision over the coming months on which of the routes to link up with.TAP's shareholders are EGL AG of Switzerland (42.5 percent), Norway's Statoil (42.5 percent) and E.ON Ruhrgas of Germany (15 percent) .Analysts have said a weakness of the project is its lack of Italian partners. Some argue a pipeline into Italy would never secure political backing without an Italian company as investor.For its part, the Italian government is seeking to turn Italy into a southern European gas hub in an effort to reduce energy prices, which are among the highest in Europe and damaging Italian companies at a time of economic crisis.Nabucco's six shareholders are Austria's OMV AG , Germany's RWE AG , Hungary's MOL through its gas pipeline operator FGSZ, Turkey's Botas, BEH of Bulgaria and Romania's Transgaz .(Additional reporting by Stephen Jewkes in Milan; editing by James Jukwey)	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	3	1	1	1	3	4

This is crucial, not just for European aviation, but for our economies at large," said ACI Europe's Director General Olivier Jankovec.Negotiations could be complicated by a bitter row with the United States, China and India over the European Union's decision to force foreign airlines using its airports to pay for their carbon emissions, the bloc's transport chief said."It is a problem for aviation relations with certain partners, but I hope very much that we can conclude negotiations," Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas told a news briefing.

205	european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance	BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Creation of a banking union to help resolve the euro zone debt crisis could lead to a split within the wider European Union, lawmakers in the European Parliament warned during a debate that laid bare the extent of tensions in the bloc.Brussels proposed earlier this month that the European Central Bank (ECB) take charge of supervising all banks in the euro currency zone, as a first step towards creating a banking union under which euro zone countries would eventually jointly back their lenders.However, the plan has sparked concerns among the 10 EU countries which do not use the euro that they will be indirectly affected by the ECB's new supervisory powers and put at a competitive disadvantage, whether they join the scheme or not.Legally, the European Parliament will have no say in writing much of the legislation for a banking union. But it has powers to amend other important financial regulations and can exert influence to change or even delay the new regime."What's the point of having a single supervisory mechanism (for the euro zone) when you have the UK with its 60 percent of the financial market not involved?" said Werner Langen, a German lawmaker, in the debate on Wednesday."Instead of a single supervisory mechanism, we have a division of Europe, a very explosive division."Langen's views were echoed throughout the debate of the parliament's influential economic and monetary affairs committee, where members from around Europe voiced conflicting views about the shape of a banking union."What we don't want to do here is split the EU down the middle," said Wolf Klinz, a German member of parliament. "What we don't want to see is that the British push themselves into a corner where they have a referendum and they say ... that's enough for us."BETTER CONTROLA banking union, which would aim to restore confidence in an industry that has been battered by crisis for nearly five years, has three major steps: the ECB takes over monitoring euro zone banks and others that sign up; a single fund is created to close down and settle the debts of failed banks; and a comprehensive scheme to protect savers' deposits is established.As well as building the foundation for better control of banks, the union would be important because it should allow the euro zone's rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), to directly inject much-needed capital into banks, such as those in Spain."We are under time pressure," said Sven Giegold, a German member of the parliament, who also flagged concerns about a two-tier scheme damaging those countries on the outside. "The banking union ... is linked to access to the ESM."This pledge, made by euro zone leaders in June, appears to be unraveling, however, after Germany, the Netherlands and Finland drew a distinction between future banking problems and "legacy" difficulties - which could mean that problem banks in Spain and Ireland remain the states' responsibility."This proposal is to allow for the direct recapitalization of Spanish banks because Spain doesn't want to put in a normal application (for aid)," said Langen, who is a member of the CDU, the same political party as German Chancellor Angela Merkel."The whole European system of banking supervision is being turned on its head for the sake of Spain. As this thing has been turned on its head, we need to turn it back again," Langen said.SUPERVISORY REACHThe debate underscored a central problem of the union - that it could drive a wedge between those countries inside the scheme and those outside, whose banks may suffer as a result.Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg has said he would not accept ECB oversight of Nordea , the Nordic region's biggest bank, as long as his country remains outside a banking union. Nordea has its headquarters outside the euro zone in Stockholm, but has major operations in Finland, the sole Nordic country to use the common currency.While Britain will stay outside the scheme, many international banks in London - ranging from HSBC to Citi - have operations in the euro zone that will be affected by the ECB's new supervisory reach.London is worried that the ECB, emboldened by its new powers, will demand regulation that could undermine the city's position as Europe's financial capital.Some believe that the European Banking Authority (EBA), set up to coordinate the supervision of banks in response to the financial crisis and which is run by regulators from across the European Union, could act as a counterbalance.The European Commission has already suggested a special voting mechanism among EU regulators as a counterweight to the power of those in the euro zone."Countries should be lured in, tempted in - it should be made difficult for a country to refuse," said Giegold, who will play a leading role in talks about the plan."The system should be so attractive that everyone will want to join," Giegold said, in an appeal which is likely to be ignored in London.The close ties between some troubled governments and the banks they supervise - and on which they also rely to buy their debt - have dragged both ever-deeper into crisis.A banking union would break this link by making the policing of banks supranational and establishing central schemes paid into collectively to cover the costs of closing failed lenders and protecting savers' deposits.(Editing by David Stamp and David Holmes)	2	2	2	2	3	3	4	3	3	4	2	2	1	4	2	
206	europeans-invoke-spirit-ballesteros-ryder-comeback-031915853--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - They wore the colors loved by the late Seve Ballesteros and a silhouette of him on their sleeves, and then Team Europe rode his spirit on Sunday to the greatest Ryder Cup comeback victory ever."We wanted to do it for Seve," said Englishman Luke Donald, who started Europe on their way to erasing a massive four-point deficit with a 2&1 victory over American Bubba Watson.Spaniard Sergio Garcia turned around his match against Jim Furyk by winning the last two holes for a one-up victory."I have no doubt in my mind that he was with me today all day," Garcia said about compatriot Ballesteros, who breathed fire into the Ryder Cup after the Britain-Ireland team was expanded to include players from all of Europe."Because there's no chance I would have won my match if he wasn't there."Ballesteros died last year at age 54 after a battle with cancer.Europe captain Jose Maria Olazabal had long ago been taken under the wing of Ballesteros, who ignited a proud surge in European golf with his three British Open crowns and two Masters triumphs.Olazabal, who formed the most successful Ryder Cup tandem alongside Ballesteros, told the team in their meeting on Saturday night that he felt Seve in the room and that he could help propel the Europeans to a victory despite trailing 10-6."Seve will always be present with this team. He was a big factor for this event, for the European side and last night when we were having that meeting I think the boys understood that believing was the most important thing," said Olazabal.Wearing blue and white, the favorite colors of the fiery Spanish competitor, Europe took apart the host team to match the biggest final-day points comeback ever in the Ryder Cup.The U.S. team had overcome the same margin to beat Europe in 1999 at Brookline, with Olazabal left gloomy on the 17th green in the clinching match.But that record Ryder comeback took place before a roaring U.S. home crowd and this amazing Europe fight back came on foreign soil.The first five European players won their singles matches and the competition came down to the final two matches when 2010 PGA Championship winner Martin Kaymer sank a five-footer at the 18th to clinch it."We wanted to show our grit. We've been known for not being that great in singles, and we showed that we can win," said Donald."It's going down in history. We talk about Brookline in '99, losing that one. We wanted to come back and show that we could win from behind, too."Englishman Ian Poulter, added to the team as a wild-card pick by Olazabal, beat U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson two up to complete an impeccable Cup with wins in all four of his matches."My captain picked me to come and play, and you know, I owe it to him, and Seve, to be here today," he said.Olazabal, who had tears in his eyes after the victory, said he got emotional thinking about Ballesteros."He's already smiling about it and laughing about it," the captain said. "This has been a very special week. Seve, it's the first time that he's not here with us at the Ryder Cup."He was a very special man, and he's very close to my heart. All these (players) know much this week meant to me. I want to thank them for what they did today. They gave me the best week of my life."(Editing by Julian Linden)	3	3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	3	4	1	4	
207	even-healthy-lungs-hold-bacteria-communities-192528174	Healthy lungs are home to bacterial communities, just as healthy intestines and skin are.That was one finding of new research that also showed that while patients with cystic fibrosis may be hampered by the bacterial communities that live in their lungs, it is the composition of these colonies, rather than their mere presence, that causes problems."For many years, people have considered the lung to be a relatively sterile organ," said study researcher Dr. David Cornfield, a professor of pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine. "This provides some of the first and most definitive data that there is a forest of flora that exist in the lung, that are present even in the healthy lung."The finding also suggests that probiotics could help in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that results from receiving copies of a recessive gene from both parents. The disorder results in thicker, stickier mucus in the lungs and other organs, which allows certain bacteria to overgrow.This can lead to infections and blockages, and eventually breathing difficulties, nutritional deficiencies, endocrine disorders such as diabetes, and infertility in men, among other problems. Patients tend not to live past age 40.In the new study, researchers examined the sputum from 16 cystic fibrosis patients and nine healthy control patients, and surveyed the organisms present using gene sequencing. By examining the genes, rather than growing the bacteria in lab dishes, the researchers were able to get a better handle on the diversity of bacteria present.While each person studied had a unique bacterial community in their lungs, the cystic fibrosis patients had communities that were more similar to each other than to those of the healthy people. The patients' communities were also less diverse."This suggests there's probably some benefit to having bacteria in the lungs, to some balanced degree," Cornfield said."The traditional paradigm, that all bacteria in the lungs are bad, is probably not correct."Instead, he said the findings support the idea of thinking of the bacteria in the lungs as a "rain forest.""We know that in a rain forest, if species are lost, there develops an imbalance, and the ecosystem becomes much more fragile," Cornfield said.While the lungs have been thought of as sterile, this is not the first study to find bacteria in healthy lungs, although the idea of communities is still somewhat controversial."Anything that comes into contact with the world is not going to be sterile," said Katrine Whiteson, a postdoctoral fellow at San Diego State University who studies microbe communities in the human body.Whiteson said one issue not addressed by this study, but that is being tackled elsewhere, is the question of whether bacteria remain in the lungs over the long term, or whether they are "tourists" — with some strains leaving a person's lungs and new ones entering.The new research, Cornfield said, could lead to better treatments for cystic fibrosis patients. He said long-term antibiotics, a treatment given to many patients today, might become more effective if combined with probiotics to enhance bacterial diversity in patients lungs, although much more research is necessary to see if that is the case."That would be a paradigm shift of virtually epic proportions in the cystic fibrosis and even the lung biology community," Cornfield said.The study appears online today (Sept. 26) in the journal Science Translational Medicine.Pass it on: Healthy lungs are home to colonies of bacteria, the discovery of which may lead to better treatments for cystic fibrosis sufferers.Follow MyHealthNewsDaily on Twitter @MyHealth_MHND.

208	everything-know-nfl-referee-lockout-185500763	It’s a professional referee’s job to ensure that games run smoothly, so it's perhaps no surprise that the absence of refs from this season's NFL games — thanks to contract disputes between the league and the referees' union — has led to almost unprecedented chaos. After three weeks of controversial calls, which culminated in a game-changing decision in a matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers on Monday, news outlets have reported that the referees and the NFL are close to signing a deal. As the lockout approaches its end, it's worth looking back at how it began. What is the dispute about? Who should be blamed? And what does it mean for the future of the football season? Here, everything you need to know about the NFL's referee lockout:What are the NFL and the referees fighting about?There are several areas of disagreement, but the biggest sticking point is money. The referees want to stick with a pension plan that was originally negotiated in 2006; the NFL wants to implement a 401(k) plan instead. The NFL's refusal to budge has puzzled many analysts because the cost differential between the pension and the 401(k) is relatively small: Roughly .33 percent of the league's annual $10 billion revenue, or $100,000 per team per season — a figure some commentators have called the equivalent of a "rounding error" for the NFL.Who did the NFL hire to replace the locked-out referees?A group of less-experienced officials culled from smaller markets like the Arena Football League, Divisions II and III of the NCAA, and — in one particularly damning case — the Lingerie Football League (LFL), a far-from-professional league in which women play the game in bras and panties. Fans and commentators have expressed both frustration with this solution and sympathy for the stand-in refs' inexperience.What do the NFL players think?The vast majority have sided with the referees. Many players have spoken of their exasperation in post-game interviews, or taken to Twitter, voicing complaints like "I thought I was watching Punk'd" and calling the use of replacements "a slap in the face."What do sportswriters think?They're furious. "The NFL used to be the Mona Lisa," says Rick Reilly at ESPN.com, rather grandly, and the referee's strike "is painting a mustache on it." "This may not be the worst mistake a commissioner has made in my lifetime, but it is surely the dumbest," adds Michael Rosenberg at Sports Illustrated. The general consensus: The NFL has seriously damaged its integrity, and put its players at risk, to save money that it would barely even notice was gone.Has the lockout hurt the NFL?In reputation, yes; in revenue, no. Despite widespread criticism from fans and players, neither viewership nor attendance has declined. In fact, the debate over the Seahawks-Packers game has drawn much attention to the NFL, leading many analysts to conclude that NFL ratings will be up next weekend — if only due to perverse curiosity — which may be why the league hasn't seemed to be in a hurry to cut a deal.Will the lockout really end soon?Reports are mixed. According to ESPN.com, an "agreement in principle" is ready, and the remaining points of contention are minor enough that locked-out officials may even be on the field again by Sunday. But the Los Angeles Times countered, quoting an inside source that says "a deal is not as close as has been reported."SEE MORE: Peyton Manning's underwhelming Broncos debut: 4 talking pointsView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	4	4	2	3	3	3	2	2	4	3	4	3	1	2	3	3

210	ex-intel-executive-sentenced-nyc-fraud-205237126--finance	NEW YORK (AP) — A former Intel executive was credited for his extensive cooperation as he was sentenced in New York to probation for feeding confidential information about the computer-chip maker to a billionaire hedge fund manager.Rajiv Goel apologized and said he was "deeply ashamed" before he was sentenced Monday in federal court in Manhattan. Judge Barbara Jones also fined the Los Altos, Calif. resident $10,000 and ordered him to forfeit $266,000.Goel was a director of strategic investments at Intel Capital, the investment arm of Intel Corp., until he left the company in 2009.He admitted supplying secret details about Intel's investments to an influential hedge fund founder he met at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business in the early 1980s.	2	3	3	2	3	3	3	2	3	3	3	2	1	3	2	4
211	ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business	LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - As a former wrestler, Mulayam Singh Yadav has got India's government where he likes it - in a vice-like grip.The ructions over fresh economic reforms that reduced the ruling coalition to a parliamentary minority last month left Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dependent on this wheeler-dealer from the country's dusty northern plains.In an interview with Reuters, Yadav insisted there were no strings attached to his support for Singh's Congress party, just a desire to keep the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power."We are supporting them," he said in the Hindi language, looking hearty for his 72 years despite rumors earlier this year that his health was failing. "There are no conditions of any kind, it's only to ensure communal forces do not get strengthened."However, Yadav is at least as well known for his maneuvering as he was in his youth for pinning opponents down in a wrestling bout: Congress party leaders know he cannot be trusted to stick with them through thick and thin - and few are convinced when he denies any ambition to one day become prime minister.For now, the 22 lawmakers of Yadav's Samajwadi (Socialist) Party will side with the government, ensuring it can muster the 272 votes needed in parliament to prevent its collapse. Their support became crucial after another regional party leader left the coalition, angry over hikes in the price of subsidized fuel and a decision to open India's doors to foreign supermarket giants.Yadav's take on the reforms is that he opposes them, but will nevertheless continue to support the government. "We will oppose anything that goes against the interests of the people," he said. "But we will not allow the government to fall."A FAMILY BUSINESSYadav was born to a rural family in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state with 200 million people and - since it sends more lawmakers to Delhi than any other - its politically most important.As a young man, he trained as a wrestler before being attracted to socialism and local politics, eventually becoming chief minister of the state three times and federal defense minister in a coalition government during the 1990s.Six months ago, when his Samajwadi Party returned to power in Uttar Pradesh after a hiatus, Yadav stood aside for his son Akhilesh to head the state government. That, and what was perhaps a bout of ill-health, set off reports he was seriously ill and no longer well enough to hold office."I am fine," Yadav said at his sprawling colonial bungalow in Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh. Impeccably dressed in the starched white dhoti-kurta of the region and his salt-and-pepper hair still damp from a mid-morning bath, he showed few signs of age as he strode out from under the porch of his home, chatting with aides and party colleagues."Those were just rumors. I went on the campaign trail and I am fine now."In India, where caste and family play hugely important roles in politics, the Yadavs have several advantages. They are from a land-owning lower caste whose members were mostly subsistence farmers and cattle herders, but have become wealthier, more politically aware and socially assertive in recent decades.Yadav, his daughter-in-law Dimple, a cousin and a nephew are in the federal parliament. A brother is in the Uttar Pradesh state government headed by Akhilesh.On the negative side, the party is anathema for other lower caste groups. Critics also say it is tarred by association with people who have criminal pasts, and previous Samajwadi Party rule in Uttar Pradesh brought rampant corruption and increased violence.The other family firmly entrenched in Indian politics is the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has ruled the country for a majority of the years since independence in 1947, and also looks on Uttar Pradesh as its base.Akhilesh is often compared to the scion of that dynasty, Rahul Gandhi, whose Congress party was burned by the Samajwadi win in the Uttar Pradesh elections earlier this year. He dismisses talk of rivalry or probable cooperation."He is a new leader, a nice man, a youth leader," Akhilesh said in a separate interview. "We are of the same age. His party should give him an opportunity."INDIA'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER?Although the Congress party-led coalition could coax other parties to keep it alive, for now it is dependent on Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is widely expected to demand a pound of flesh despite his professed unconditional support.News reports have said he will press for an illegal wealth case against him to be dropped, and for impoverished Uttar Pradesh to get more federal aid.Longer term, Yadav could be preparing to form a "Third Front" government, an amalgam of smaller parties that keeps out both Congress and BJP after national elections due by mid-2014.Analysts and voter surveys suggest no clear winner will emerge in those polls, meaning the Third Front may well have the parliamentary numbers to stake a claim to power.Since Yadav's party won Uttar Pradesh with a large majority, odds are he will have enough lawmakers in parliament after the 2014 elections to put him in pole position to form a coalition, and to head it.Asked if Yadav could become prime minister, Sudha Pai, a political scientist who is rector at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said: "He knows how to make a deal, how to get on with other political parties. He is very good at negotiating, he is the traditional Indian politician."Yadav dismisses such ambitions: "I have never been a candidate for prime ministership, and I am not now," he said.But the murmurs in his party, where he is called Netaji, or leader, are growing."No political party has a leader who is from a village or is a farmer," said Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary. "This is a nation of villagers and farmers and Netaji represents 70 percent of the country."THE YOUNGER YADAVThe Samajwadi Party, which is more or less restricted to Uttar Pradesh, cannot expect to get anything near a parliamentary majority on its own, but its workers say it can clinch up to 60 of the state's 80 parliamentary seats.It could be joined by other regional parties and left-wing groups and even a section of the Congress party could be won over to cobble a majority, analysts say.Akhilesh, the son and new chief minister, says governing Uttar Pradesh is as important to him as increasing numbers in parliament."It's not enough to say that because we won the state elections so well, we will get more MPs," he said. "I have to perform, and if people believe that my government has performed well, then the result will be good."My priority is Uttar Pradesh," said the 39-year-old, a contrast, at least on the surface, to his politician father.The younger Yadav speaks fluent English, is tech-savvy, and studied in Australia. He was trained as an environment engineer and was once a keen footballer and Manchester United supporter. Now he says, politics consume him almost completely."If we go to the center, Netaji will go there (and) some of our senior leadership, but I am happy in the state," he said, adding the party was not looking to topple Prime Minister Singh.His father is similarly cautious."In 2014, Samajwadi will fight on its own strength, there will be no understanding with anyone," he said. "After the elections, things (alliances) happen, nothing happens before. Depending on the circumstances, we will take decisions then."(Editing by John Chalmers and Dean Yates)	3	3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	4
212	exclusive-facebook-charge-merchants-run-offers-130631159--sector	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said it will start charging businesses to run Offers on its social network, turning a previously free service into a potential revenue generator at a time when Wall Street is demanding new sources of growth and profit from the company.Facebook launched Facebook Offers earlier this year, letting retailers and other local merchants send deals to their Facebook fans. Users claim the offers from their News Feeds and redeem the vouchers at stores to get discounts.The service has been free, but in coming weeks Facebook will require merchants to pay at least $5 on related ads to promote each Facebook Offer to a targeted audience of fans and friends of fans. The cost will vary based on the size of a company's Facebook pages.Since Facebook went public in May, the company has been under pressure from Wall Street to show how it can turn its giant social network into a money machine. Facebook shares have lost about 40 percent of their value since the IPO.The commerce potential of Facebook, known as f-commerce, has yet to materialize, partly because retailers have been able to feast on a host of free tools on the social network to attract customers.Tying Facebook Offers to a paid ad service suggests the company is working to change this."We think this aligns incentives nicely," said Gokul Rajaram, director of product management for Facebook's advertising and Pages businesses. "The best results on Facebook Offers will come from organic distribution plus paid distribution."In the past, some Facebook Offers have not been relevant to all users, partly because some people saw deals in their News Feeds from merchants located far away from where they live, Rajaram added."The requirement to pay for related ads will focus merchants on who and where they want the offer to reach," he said.Facebook is also expanding Offers to online-only businesses, he added. Before, the service was available only to merchants with physical locations.Facebook is also adding barcodes for offers, so customers can redeem offers more easily. The barcodes work globally, Rajaram noted.The executive declined to disclose how many Facebook Offers have been run so far, how many merchants have taken part, or how many deals have been claimed and redeemed by consumers.However, he said Facebook is "very happy" with the success of its Offers business."That's why we're expanding and investing more in it," Rajaram said.(Reporting by Alistair Barr and Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)	4	4	3	4	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	2	1	1	3	3

214	exclusive-spain-ready-bailout-germany-signals-wait-sources-194756507	Madrid (Reuters) - Spain is ready to request a euro zone bailout for its public finances as early as next weekend but Germany has signaled that it should hold off, European officials said on Monday.The latest twist in the euro zone's three-year-old sovereign debt crisis comes as financial markets and some other European partners are pressuring Madrid to seek a rescue program that would trigger European Central Bank buying of its bonds."The Spanish were a bit hesitant but now they are ready to request aid," a senior European source said. Three other euro zone senior euro zone sources confirmed the shift in the Spanish position, all speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said Spain is taking all the right steps to overcome its fiscal problems and does not need a bailout, arguing that investors will recognize and reward Spanish reforms in due course.Privately, several European diplomats and a senior German source said Chancellor Angela Merkel preferred to avoid putting more individual bailouts for distressed euro zone countries to her increasingly reluctant parliament."It doesn't make sense to send looming decisions on Greece, Cyprus and possibly also Spain to the Bundestag one by one," the senior German source said. "Bundling these together makes sense, due to the substance and also politically."Participants said there were tense exchanges at a euro zone ministerial meeting in Cyprus in mid-September when Schaeuble told his peers Berlin could not take another bailout for Spain to parliament so soon after lawmakers approved up to 100 billion euros ($129 billion) to help Spanish banks in July.Asked about the reports that Germany was urging Spain to wait, a German government spokesman told Reuters: "Every country decides for itself. Germany isn't pushing in one direction or the other."A spokeswoman for Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said she was not aware of any veto from Germany for an aid request."What we are focused on is to get the decisions of the June summit on the banking union implemented. That would send a strong message of confidence to the markets," she said, referring to an EU decision to centralize oversight of the biggest banks to avoid a repeat of a crisis that has some of its roots in the banking system.STALLING?European sources said EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn was to deliver a message to Spanish leaders on Monday that Brussels wants them to apply for assistance soon and will not impose onerous conditions beyond the reforms and savings measures outlined by the Spanish government.Brussels is keen to avoid another paroxysm of the debt crisis by getting support to Spain before it is on the brink of being forced out of the bond market, at the risk of contagion spreading to Italy and other euro zone states.Rehn met Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Economy Minister Luis de Guindos in Madrid and said afterwards the conditions of any aid program were well known to all euro zone governments."Conditions would be based on country-specific recommendations that were decided for all 27 EU member states in July and there would be a clear set of policy priorities and clear timelines on the basis of these country-specific recommendations," he told a news conference.Euro zone officials are considering a so-called Enhanced Conditions Credit Line that would keep Spain in the credit markets with support from the euro zone rescue funds in the primary bond market and from the ECB in the secondary market.Rajoy is eager to avoid the political humiliation of conditions being imposed from outside and enforced by the "troika" of inspectors from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank that has supervised programs for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.There has been widespread speculation that Rajoy was stalling a bailout bid until after October 21 regional elections in his home state of Galicia and the Basque Country.But diplomats said it was German discouragement, not Spanish pride, that was now holding back a request for assistance.One senior European diplomat said the Spanish position was: "We are in favor if everyone else accepts."Madrid did not want to risk submitting an application and having Berlin rebuff it by raising unacceptable conditions such as deep pension cuts or procedural obstacles, he said.The senior euro zone source said Spanish leaders had understood that making a move now was the best way of avoiding losing market access and being forced into a full state bailout."The German U-turns have convinced the Spanish they could end up in the not too distant future in the same position as Greece, Portugal or Ireland - shut out of the markets and with a very harsh adjustment program," the source said.The Spanish government said it would enact 43 structural reforms over the next six months and Brussels said the detailed timetable goes beyond what the Commission has asked of Spain and is an ambitious step forward.Rehn said he was fully confident Spain would take the necessary steps to restore the economy to health and added it must continue reforming its pension system, linking retirement age to life expectancy.Rajoy has said pensions are the last thing he would cut as he introduces sweeping savings through the social security system, though he has said he would introduce a new law on pensions before the end of the year.Spain needs to refinance some 29 billion euros in maturing debt -- including 9 billion in short-term paper -- by the end of this month.The senior euro zone source said that under one scenario under consideration, Spain was ready to submit the request at the weekend, with German agreement, so euro zone finance ministers could discuss it at their next regular meeting in Luxembourg next Monday.Failing that, Madrid could make the application before an EU summit in Brussels on October 18-19, but euro zone partners such as France and Italy, which are pushing for an early decision, would not want it to drag on beyond then, the source said.

That clocks in around 0.15% of its 65.3 million total Likes.Other top offenders included singers Rihanna who lost 28,000 Likes, Shakira who shed 26,000 and Lady Gaga who dropped 34,000.Zynga's Farmville game was another big loser with 45,000 Likes gone.Facebook previously said it had "dedicated protections" against threats that result in fake Likes, but emphasized that these improved systems to safeguard the network's integrity "have been specially configured to identify and take action against suspicious Likes.""Users will continue to connect to the Pages and Profiles they authentically want to subscribe to, and Pages will have a more accurate measurement of fan count and demographics," Facebook wrote in its August post.

The company’s photo sync service will store any picture taken with an Android device in a private “Synced from Phone” folder on Facebook. Once photos have been synced to the Web, users can then pick and choose which images should be shared with friends. The feature is similar to those found on Google+, Dropbox and Apple’s (AAPL) Photostream, all of which offer online photo syncing.

Since the content is no longer visible, it's also not deletable by either party unless the block is removed.That's clearly noted when you start to block a person on the site "Blocking means you won't be able to see on contact each other of Facebook," however, it's a one-sided agreement that doesn't notify the person being blocked, and leaves all of the content you've posted up to that point still in tact, just not visible to either of you.[More from Mashable: What Is ‘Native Advertising’? Depends Who You Ask]To test the theory, I posted a photo of a Spy Cat on Mashable Business Editor Todd Wasserman’s wall. He was able to see the message when I posted it, however, when I blocked him a few minutes later the image was no longer visible to him or I, but was visible to Christina Warren who was his Facebook friend.Since you can’t remove what you can’t see, Todd could have potentially never realized a posted the photo in the first place, although it would still be visible to his entire friend base for eternity. He also won’t be able to delete that post from his wall, nor will I unless I decide to unblock him on the site.While our cat experiment is certainly harmless, the vunerability could certainly be used maliciously, and for posting photo a bit more risqué than a cat looking through some window blinds.We've reached out to Facebook comment.[Thanks @MathiasOlofsson!]This story originally published on Mashable here.	4	3	3	3	4	2	2	2	3	3	2	1	1	2	3	3

224	facebook-youtube-blocked-kashmir-212726149	The government of India-administered Kashmir has blocked Facebook and YouTube, highlighting concerns about a clampdown on freedom of speech in the disputed region.The move follows a gradual increase in online surveillance throughout the past few years in Kashmir, as youths have turned to social media as a form of political expression. After people in the Kashmir Valley protested the recent anti-Islam video that unleashed similar protests across the Muslim world, observers say it gave the government the excuse it was looking for and YouTube and Facebook went dead.“This is one more step in pursuit of depriving the people of avenues of expression. The telecast of blasphemous film on YouTube simply served as a pretext to execute a predetermined policy by the government,” says Sheikh Showkat Hussain, a political analyst and academic who teaches human rights at Kashmir University.RELATED: Think you know Asia? Take this quiz.For six decades, a piece of land about the size of Britain situated between Pakistan and India has been the source of major tension and fighting between the two countries. Many within the mostly-Muslim Kashmir Valley want to be free of India. Nearly 70,000 people died following the outbreak of an armed Kashmiri insurgency in 1989, now quelled.Kashmir’s state government has clamped down on freedom of speech in the past. During mass street protests in 2008, the government banned SMS text messaging. And since another protest wave in 2010, a number of college students have been arrested and taken to Cyber Cell Police Station, located in the summer capital of Srinagar, for posting or uploading anti-India text or pictures on Facebook or YouTube.“Such a move by the government is a serious infringement on the freedom of speech,” says Sameer Yasir, assistant professor at the Centre for International Relations at the Islamic University of Science and Technology. The state has long wanted to block these specific sites, he says, but worried about popular outcry. This unprecedented step, he says, ultimately causes free speech to suffer. “This is unethical because social networking sites provide information to people. [A] gag on these sites is a suffering,” he says.Dr. Hussain agrees: “Avenues of communication remain strangulated in Kashmir,” he says. “Internet was allowed after a lot of persuasion and resentment,” he adds. “However, with the passage of time other avenues of expression and communication were choked. The local news channels [have been] unable to telecast news and commentary since 2010 mass protests. SMS is banned on prepaid mobile networks.”The Internet has been widely used by people in Kashmir, especially as a tool during times of military clampdown. Groups resisting Indian rule use Facebook to disseminate their message through Facebook pages such as "Freedom of Dawn," "Hoshar Jamaat" (Awakened Group), and "Kale Kharaab" (Hot Headed).The popular separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani has been using YouTube as a way to get around the fact that the state government doesn’t allow him to address any public rally or go to Friday prayers.One popular Facebook group, Aalaw (A call), found a way to still post a protest. The group recently posted on its feed: “Facebook partially banned in valley, sms banned, people caged this is what you called indian demon-crazy. Down with indian state and its policies. Aalaw will continue to reach you no matter facebook gets blocked in valley. Aalaw Radio Is on Cards.(sic)”The private Internet service providers said their customer care executives reported that Facebook and YouTube would be restored after the ban is lifted by the government, but they are not sure when that will happen.Related storiesRead this story at csmonitor.comBecome a part of the Monitor community	3	4	3	3	3	2	3	4	3	2	3	3	1	2	3	4
225	factbox-key-facts-colombian-president-santos-004416726	(Reuters) - Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos is to be operated on Wednesday for a small cancerous tumor in the prostate.Here are some facts about Santos:* Born into one of Colombia's most powerful families, Santos is the consummate political insider. His great uncle, Eduardo Santos, served as president. A cousin was a vice president. Before moving into politics, Santos was an editor at the country's leading newspaper, El Tiempo, once owned by his family.* Trained as an economist in the United States and Britain, Santos has published several books including: "The Third Way," with assistance from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair; and a book about the military operations against leftist rebels he helped orchestrate as defense minister.* Santos, 61, held several ministerial positions before taking office in 2010. As defense minister under former President Alvaro Uribe, Santos oversaw the military campaign that largely drove the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, into remote regions. Major victories included the 2008 rescue of French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt and three U.S. defense contractors held hostage by the rebels.* As president, Santos has steered key initiatives through Congress, among of them the fiscal rule that aims at balancing the budget by 2014. He also changed the way royalties from natural resources such oil and mining are distributed and made it possible for land seized by paramilitaries and rebels to be returned to the rightful owners.* Santos was in charge of overseeing a bombing raid in Ecuadorean territory in 2008 that killed the FARC's No. 2 commander in a huge blow to the rebels. The attack also damaged Colombia's relations with Ecuador and Venezuela.* He also oversaw the killing of the FARC's top leader, Alfonso Cano last year, and its military commander, Mono Jojoy, in 2010.* He was finance minister in the 1990s when the Andean nation faced one of its worst fiscal crises. He was also a representative to the London-based International Coffee Organization.(Reporting by Helen Murphy; editing by Mohammad Zargham)	2	3	2	3	2	1	3	2	2	2	2	4	2	2	2	4

227	falcons-4-0-30-28-win-over-panthers-102848973--spt	ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Falcons never trailed in their first three games.Now they know they can play from behind, too.Rallying in the final minute from their 1-yard line, the unbeaten Falcons scrambled into position for Matt Bryant's 40-yard field goal with 5 seconds remaining and pulled out a 30-28 victory over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.Atlanta (4-0) is off to its best start since 2004, when the Falcons reached the NFC championship game.This team has even higher goals."We're not good enough to play every game from ahead," coach Mike Smith said. "This showed the mettle of the guys in that locker room. They showed a lot of resiliency."No one was more resilient than Matt Ryan. Shaking off a career-high seven sacks, the Falcons' quarterback dropped back into his own end zone and threw up a pass that Roddy White snatched away between two defenders for a 59-yard gain. After a pass interference and a couple of short completions, Bryant won it with a kick right down the middle."We're right where we need to be in terms of our record," said Ryan, who threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns despite taking an awful beating. "In terms of our play, we've got a lot of improving to do."After squandering a 24-14 lead in the second half, the Falcons needed a crucial fumble by Cam Newton to even have a chance — and they still faced long odds when the Panthers downed a punt at the Atlanta 1 with 1:09 remaining.Ryan had no timeouts and surely some doubt about how much time his beleaguered offensive line would give him. But he dropped back about as far as he could, threw it about as far as he could, and relied on White to go up and make the catch.He did, the biggest catch of all on a day when he had eight for 169 yards."Matt told me he was going to throw it up there. Just make a play," said White, who also had a pair of touchdowns. "Not for one second did we think we were going to lose the game."Newton threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score. But he let the ball slip away when it looked as though he had clinched the victory for the Panthers (1-3)."You have to protect the football," Newton said. "That was a key focus going into this game, and I fumbled. There's a lot of guys that are trusting the ballcarrier, and I was the ballcarrier that particular play to get the job done. And I dropped the ball."On third-and-2 at the Atlanta 46, Newton took the snap and bulled his way over the left side, his body surging across the spot needed for the first down. On the sideline, several of the Panthers broke into a celebration.But John Abraham knocked it loose, the ball squirting backward. Fullback Mike Tolbert covered it for Carolina at the 45 — 1 yard shy of a first down. After attempting unsuccessfully to draw the Falcons offside, the Panthers punted it away.The Falcons took advantage.Once they got Bryant in position, it was over.The 37-year-old kicker made all three of his attempts against the Panthers, improving to 9 for 9 on the season. Since joining the Falcons during the 2009 season, he has missed only eight of 79 tries."Clutch," is how Ryan described him.Charles Johnson spent so much time in the Atlanta backfield, he should've worn a Falcons jersey. He was credited with 3½ sacks and hit Ryan five other times after he got the ball away.If only Johnson could've gotten to him one more time — on that long pass to White."I just heard the crowd, and when I got up I was kind of in disbelief," Johnson said. "I couldn't believe what had happened. You know they were going to go deep, but that's one of the plays that we're going to have to learn from. I think it's either going to make us or it's going to break us. We'll see down the road."Newton's fumble ruined what had been a stellar performance. He threw for 215 yards, including a 17-yard touchdown to Greg Olsen early in the game, then a 36-yard scoring play to Kealoha Pilares that put the Panthers ahead 28-24 with 7:55 remaining.Newton also ran for 86 yards on nine carries, bulling his way into the end zone from 4 yards out late in the third quarter.The Panthers played much better than they did in their last outing, a 36-7 home loss to the New York Giants, but it wasn't enough to prevent them from sliding a daunting three games behind Atlanta in the NFC South."I want to apologize to my teammates and the fans that were watching out there," Newton said. "Everybody was doing their job. I clearly had the first down, but I've just got to hold onto the football."NOTES: Michael Turner scored on a 60-yard screen pass, the first touchdown reception of his nine-year career. ... Carolina S Haruki Nakamura had an early interception, but it was largely a day to forget. He was beaten on both of White's touchdown receptions, missed a tackle on Turner's scoring play and had the ball snatched away by White on the long pass that set up the winning field goal. ... The Falcons travel to Washington next Sunday, while Carolina hosts Seattle.___Online: http://pro32.ap.org/poll and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL	2	2	4	3	3	3	3	2	2	5	3	3	2	2	2	3
228	families-libyas-missing-lead-backlash-against-militias-122742959	BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - The face of a young man looks out from billboards across Benghazi. "A mother's cry. If my son is guilty, bring him to justice. If he is innocent, let him go," says the caption, which ends with a phone number.Speaking at the family home, the mother, Ansaf Ibrahim, recounts how dozens of militia fighters from the February 17 Brigade stormed in on August 30 and seized her husband Ali Muftag al-Warfalli and their son Firas, 21, a dentistry student.The brigade, named for the start date of the revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, is one of the largest and most heavily armed militias prowling Libya a year after the civil war ended. Most operate with the permission of the weak central government. They answer to their own leaders and maintain their own jails.Such arrests, described by many Libyans as kidnappings, are fuelling a backlash, which has intensified in the days since the killing of U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in an attack on the U.S. consulate.Ansaf Ibrahim says a few people have called in response to the billboards but so far they have not been able to help, offering only sympathy. "One person called to say his own mother fell sick with grief when she saw the billboards."The militia say their powers to arrest and detain people are vital to protect a country where the police and security forces are too weak to maintain order.February 17 says it has turned the two al-Warfalli prisoners over to the military police. A member of the brigade's High Security Committee said Ali Muftag, the father, was held on suspicion of having ties to Gaddafi loyalists in Egypt and Firas on suspicion of links to militants who set off bombs in Tripoli.Ansaf Ibrahim says both men are innocent.She believes her son was taken in just because he was at home when the militia arrived to arrest her husband, who was a student in Britain in the 1980s when pro-Gaddafi students inside the Libyan embassy were blamed for shooting a policewoman."Whatever they think the father has done, that doesn't mean my son has done something too. If you want the father, you do not have to take the son in this horrible, frightening and savage way," she said.PULLED OFF STREET AFTER SPEAKING OUTActivists who speak out against the detentions say they frequently become targets too.Journalist Sherifa al-Senoussi al-Fsay, who has criticized militia abductions in television broadcasts, was pulled off the street in May after leaving the home of a detainee's family. A car pulled up and armed men jumped out."They took my bag and searched it. They saw my journalist ID. I was yelling, saying I was a journalist," she recalled."I was trying to make them stop. One of them grabbed my veil. They tried to haul me away. I wriggled free and ran to a building. I tried to ask for help but one of the men grabbed me and dragged me across the ground. They took me to the car, threw me inside and beat me."She says she was driven to a deserted spot and bundled into another car with another group of armed men, who also hit her.Finally, she was delivered to a police station in central Benghazi. Activists demonstrated outside to demand her release and, after two days, a sympathetic militia leader sent armed men into the police station to free her.Four months later, al-Fsay still does not dare say which of the hundreds of armed groups she blames for having captured her, fearful they will retaliate.The government says it is taking steps to rein in the militia. Those that operate without government permission are being dissolved, while those that have government permission are being incorporated into the regular army's chain of command.The government said on Monday it was replacing the civilian leaders of February 17 and another powerful Benghazi militia that also operates its own jail, Rafalla al-Sahati. The leaders of the two militias, among the most powerful men in the country, are to be replaced with uniformed army colonels, putting their forces fully under the army chain of command.The billboard pictures of Firas al-Warfalli stared down as thousands of Libyans demonstrated over the weekend against militias on a march known as "Rescue Benghazi Day".The protesters seized bases of the Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia, which did not have government permission and which Washington suspects of having had some kind of connection to the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens.The demonstrators then marched on the heavily fortified compound of Rafallah al-Sahati, one of the biggest militias that operate with government approval. The protesters looted the compound and freed prisoners. The authorities backed the militia the following morning and its base is again occupied.At the al-Warfalli house, Firas's 10-year-old brother comes into the room where his mother is meeting journalists, poses for a snapshot and scampers out. "My little son has a new game he plays," his mother says, imitating a small boy pretending to fire a machine gun. "He says: ‘I'm going to kill February 17 and get my father back for us.'"(editing by Janet McBride)	4	4	5	4	5	3	3	3	4	2	4	3	2	4	4	
229	farm-state-lawmakers-returning-home-empty-handed-071111240--election	WASHINGTON (AP) — Farm-state members of Congress have campaigned for decades on the back of farm bills delivering election-season subsidies and other goodies to rural voters.Not this year. The bill is stalled, primarily because House GOP leaders don't want a noisy fight over food stamps this close to the election. That poses a particular problem for some Republicans in tight races for the Senate or the House who will go home empty-handed when Congress adjourns this week.Democrats are gloating."It's something that should have been easy," says Heidi Heitkamp, the Democrat running against Republican Rep. Rick Berg in a neck-and-neck, open Senate race in North Dakota. "Something that should have been done did not get done."Heitkamp and other Democratic challengers are using the farm bill as an example of how they say the Republican-run House is ineffective. Current farm law, which extends subsidy payments to farmers and pays for food stamps, is scheduled to expire Sept. 30, with no new law in place for the first time in recent memory.In addition to the effect on the North Dakota race, the failure to get a farm bill is affecting the Senate race in Montana and House races in Iowa, South Dakota, Colorado and Illinois.Farm policy has traditionally been one of the more bipartisan issues on Capitol Hill. It still is, to an extent — the Senate in June passed the five-year farm bill with almost two-thirds of the chamber supporting it. A separate version passed the House Agriculture Committee in July with Republican and Democratic support.Calling it a farm bill is something of a misnomer. Food stamps make up roughly 80 percent of the costs in both versions. The House would cut them 2 percent, angering many Democrats who don't want them cut at all and Republicans who say they should be cut more. The Senate version would cut them by one-half of 1 percent.Since 2008, the food stamp program has more than doubled in cost, to $80 billion a year, driven by high, sustained unemployment, rising food prices and expanded eligibility under President Barack Obama's 2009 economic stimulus law. Food stamps now help feed roughly 46 million Americans, or 1 in 7.It is unclear how angry rural voters will be about the lack of a farm bill. The farm economy has been strong in recent years, and expiration won't mean an immediate loss of benefits for most farmers. But farm-state members argue that the certainty of federal policy is necessary for farmers making their annual business plans this fall and approaching bankers for loans.Punting the bill may also mean less money overall. While both chambers' versions of the bill would save tens of billions of dollars from current spending, the agriculture committees may be asked to save even more as budgets tighten further next year."They are concerned there will be fewer resources if we do it next year, so they worry it will hurt their crop insurance," Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said of farmers in his state, where he and Rep. Tom Latham both face serious challenges from Democrats.King and Berg — along with Republican House colleagues Denny Rehberg of Montana, Kristi Noem of South Dakota and others — have made repeated appeals to Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and other GOP leaders to bring the Agriculture Committee's bill to the floor before Congress adjourns this week."The farm bill is far too important for too many Montanans to let election-year politics get in the way of doing the right thing," said Rehberg, who is in a competitive Senate race.Noem, who is defending her House seat against Democrat Matt Varilek, said party leaders are hesitant to bring up a vote on a bill that they think might fail."I am sure they are getting tired of seeing me come down the hallway to talk to them about that," she said. "It's been a disappointment to me that they've made the decisions that they have made."Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., said the legislation has turned into "a food stamp bill" that has bogged down because of both the presidential and congressional campaigns."There's not 218 votes to pass it," Huelskamp told reporters. "It's going to be very tough to do that, even in a lame-duck session."Some House Democrats also are scrambling for cover. Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, who faces a challenge from 2010 opponent Ben Lange, last week introduced a discharge petition to place the bill on the floor calendar over House leaders' objections.Though Berg, Noem, Rehberg and a handful of other Republicans signed it, a majority of the House is needed — unlikely when Republicans hold 240 seats to Democrats' 190 and after conservative groups came out against the bill as too expensive."I am frustrated that it's not progressing," Berg said of the bill. "The unfortunate thing is that I am seeing it become political, which it really hasn't been for the last year and a half."Heitkamp is up with radio ads in North Dakota criticizing Berg for "toeing the party line" on farm programs and endorsing some agriculture cuts. In the ad, targeted at farmers who listen to the radio while out in the fields, she reminds voters that agriculture is a $6 billion industry in the state.Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who is facing the challenge from Rehberg and is himself a farmer, calls the House's failure to take up the farm bill "total craziness.""It's going to have some pretty negative effects on agriculture if these people don't get off their butts and get it passed," he said in an interview. "I am going to continue to try and talk some common sense into the House of Representatives."Also getting criticism on the campaign trail for the farm bill's collapse are Republican Reps. Scott Tipton in Colorado and Rep. Bobby Schilling in Illinois.The House in July passed a bill that would help livestock producers who are losing money because of a widespread drought, but the Senate has declined to take that up, with Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow saying that similar benefits are included in the larger bill. Republicans Rehberg and Berg have countered Democratic attacks by saying the Senate should consider that legislation.	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	2	3	3	2	1	2	4	4
230	farthest-galaxy-yet-revealed-cosmic-lens-182209356	The earliest known confirmed galaxy has been discovered with the help of cosmic lenses formed out of the warped fabric of space and time, researchers say.This distant, ancient galaxy may have once helped clear out the murky fog that once filled the early universe, scientists added.Astronomers estimate that the universe began about 13.7 billion years ago during the Big Bang. Recent findings suggest the first galaxies formed less than 500 million years after the universe's birth.Little is known about the earliest galaxies since their light is very faint, given how far away they are. One tool researchers can use to peer at these galaxies are so-called gravitational lenses, magnifying glasses resulting from the warped fabric of reality.Gravity curves space-time; the greater the mass of an object in space, the stronger its gravitational pull. This, in turn, bends light around it, affecting how telescopes on Earth view it. [Big Bang to Now in 10 Easy Steps]Astronomers can gauge the age of an object by estimating its distance. Since the speed of light appears the same throughout the universe, knowing how far away an object is reveals how long it took for its light to get here. Scientists can work out the distance of an object by looking at how much the light from it is distorted.Using gravitational lensing caused by one of the most massive known galaxy clusters, scientists glimpsed a galaxy that existed when the universe was about 500 million years old using two NASA space observatories: the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope.Based on its level of development, the researchers estimate this galaxy is about 150 million times the mass of the sun and formed less than 200 million years after the Big Bang. This is currently the earliest known and most distant galaxy that scientists have confidently identified."We feel like archaeologists with a pre-Neanderthal fossil in hand," lead study author Wei Zheng, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University, told SPACE.com.Astronomers have detected potentially older galaxies, but their faintness makes it difficult to make out key details regarding their age."Such a discovery would not have been possible if the object was un-lensed," Zheng said.The age of this galaxy reveals it formed during the so-called "epoch of reionization" that occurred about 150 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang. This critical but still largely mysterious event occurred when intense ultraviolet radiation cleared the fog of atomic hydrogen that once pervaded the cosmos by ionizing it into its constituent protons and electrons."This provides us with a unique glimpse of star formation and galaxy growth in the period spanning 300 [million] to 500 million years after the Big Bang," astronomer Daniel Stark at the University of Arizona at Tucson, who did not take part in this study, told SPACE.com. "While caution should be exercised in the interpretation of a single object, the results presented in the Zheng paper point to significant star formation activity throughout this period."Much remains uncertain as to what sources of radiation caused the epoch of reionization. Since the researchers found this ancient galaxy after only monitoring a small patch of sky, Zheng said the early universe may have overall been rich with galaxies that drove reionization.The scientists detailed their findings in the Sept. 20 issue of the journal Nature.Follow SPACE.com on Twitter @Spacedotcom.

231	feds-40-billion-monthly-mbs-buys-delivers-maximum-203407748--business	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve figures that $40 billion in monthly purchases of mortgage-backed securities is the most it can buy without disrupting the market, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said on Monday.Any more, he said, and market functioning could be disrupted because the Fed would dominate the purchases of new securities; any less, he said, would have less than maximum impact.The U.S. central bank this month said it would keep up its purchases of housing-backed assets until the labor market improves substantially, and would do even more if that standard is not met.The Fed is also buying Treasuries in its Operation Twist program, in which the Fed buys long-term Treasuries and sells a like amount of short-term Treasuries. "Twist" will expire at the end of the year.Saying he doubts there will be "ongoing sustained and measurable improvement in a broad set of labor market conditions" by the end of the year, Williams said the Fed will revisit its decision on the level of its monthly asset purchases at that time.Judging improvement in the job market will require a look at the unemployment rate as well as jobs gains and overall GDP growth, he said.

232	feds-evans-essential-much-now-economy-171548159--business	HAMMOND, Indiana (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Tuesday reiterated his support for the U.S. central bank's bold new push to lower borrowing costs and boost the so far "disappointing" recovery, and said the Fed should do even more."This was the time to act," Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce Business Expo in the industrial Chicago suburb of Hammond, Ind. "With the problems we face and the potential dangers lying ahead, it is essential to do as much as we can now to bolster the resiliency and vibrancy of the economy."Evans' prepared remarks were the same he gave on Sept 18, less than a week after the Fed decided to embark on a third round of asset buying and said it would not let up until the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially.The central bank also said it would keep short-term interest rates near zero until at least mid-2015, even after policymakers expect it to show signs of strength.To boost the impact of its actions, the Fed should explicitly say that it will be just as tolerant of inflation running slightly above its 2-percent goal as it is about inflation running slightly below, Evans said.U.S. core inflation has run below 2 percent since 2008. Unemployment, at 8.1 percent, is well above the 5.5 percent to 6 percent that many economists believe is normal for the economy in the long run."We should not be resistant to policies that could move the unemployment rate closer its longer-run level, but run the risk of inflation running only a few tenths above our 2 percent goal," he said. "Such accommodative polices could further improve the employment picture, even beyond our recent highly beneficial actions."(Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)	3	3	2	3	2	4	2	3	3	1	3	2	2	2	3	4
233	femininity-factor-070000657	Are Republican women politicians more "feminine" than Democratic women politicians?That's the conclusion of a new study by UCLA researchers, who found that Republican women are so much more "feminine" that college students were able to accurately predict party affiliation just by looking at the woman.The "Michele Bachmann" effect, they call it.Of course, Bachmann did not fare very well in her presidential campaign, although I think that was for reasons having nothing to do with her facial features. Neither did Sarah Palin, whom most men I know (but fewer women) consider to be very attractive.The authors also point out that being feminine isn't necessarily a positive for women, since studies have found that people tend to think of women as either feminine or competent, but not both.My own review of the studies, over the past 20 years, suggests that the issue is far more nuanced.Some years ago, a woman who was passed over for a promotion at a Big Eight accounting firm brought suit for gender discrimination after she was told that changing her hairstyle and dressing in a more feminine style might improve her chances the following year. Her claim that this amounted to sex discrimination was upheld by the Supreme Court, which means that no one says things like that anymore, much less writes them down.But do they think it? Absolutely.I remember an article from a few years ago in which women CEOs were interviewed, and every one of them, literally, was pictured in pastel colors. Yellow was the hands-down favorite. So cheerful and non-threatening. For women seeking top positions, the challenge is to appear feminine, but not too feminine; assertive, but not too aggressive; attractive, but not too sexy. My women students openly admit that they dress for interviews like dates, hoping to look their best: makeup, high heels, a well-fitting suit that shows off their figure. And I always tell them to make sure to wear a shirt under the suit jacket. Form fitting, yes. Cleavage, no.One year, a group of my students went to a local mall, showed pictures of women they had clipped from a magazine to shoppers and asked them which one they thought was a CEO and which a sales clerk. The one who looked like a model was thought to be neither; the gal with the pleasing features and short blond bob was the CEO; the overweight woman was the store clerk. Big surprise.I also remember a piece done by a conservative activist comparing the women Democrats who appear on television with their Republican counterparts. The writer's point (helped along by his rather skewed choice of pictures) was how much better looking the Republicans were.I don't claim to be a beauty, but I've never seen a worse shot of myself. And the fact that many of these women were chosen precisely because of how they look, rather than because of what they know, was entirely ignored. (After all, does anyone really listen to TV? No, they watch.)I don't know whether the UCLA students would consider Nancy Pelosi to be feminine. I do. Geraldine Ferraro? Absolutely. Hillary Clinton? Who would even ask that question about a woman who has been a role model for young women of all political persuasions, a woman who is admired around the world?The fact that serious academics would conduct such a study, and that it would be published in a peer-reviewed journal, gives me pause — and not so much about them (such studies are apparently part of a burgeoning field of research called "social vision," which is not limited to women's facial features), but about the fact that we continue to look at leadership this way. The researchers note that it may be that Republican women's faces are more traditionally pretty because conservatives are more bound by gender stereotyping. Interestingly, they found Democratic men to be more masculine than Republican men, but considered this finding to be "less revealing" for reasons that the press release, at least, did not explain.The fact that looks play a role in politics is nothing new. John Kennedy won the first televised presidential debate among those watching it, while Richard Nixon won among those listening on the radio. In most presidential elections, the taller candidate wins.

"I was freaking out, I was so excited."Bradley, who has been encouraging the Medinah crowds to roar after every U.S. success, said high decibels from the spectators helped Watson perform, but was probably not best for him."Certain players love that type of stuff, and Bubba Watson is one of those type of players," said Bradley."For me personally, I'd probably miss the ball.

239	fish-oil-supplement-research-remains-murky-110000038	If you've been following the media trail on fish oil lately, you've probably been tempted to forgo the smelly capsules. A systematic review of 20 studies published last week in JAMA The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that neither eating extra helpings of fish nor taking fish oil supplements reduces the risk of stroke, heart attack or death. In June a review of studies published on behalf of the Cochrane Collaboration, an independent, not-for-profit organization that promotes evidence-based decision-making, concluded that fish oil pills fail to prevent or treat cognitive decline. And a 2011 meta-analysis by Yale University researchers debunked the idea that omega-3s alleviate depression. These proclamations run counter to what we have been told about fish and fish oil for decades. So why is the consensus changing? Is it time for us to toss out our pills for good?Not necessarily. Although it's true that early research on fish oil seemed far more promising—one 1999 trial, for instance, reported that people who took omega-3 pills were 10 percent less likely to have a heart attack, stroke or die from cardiac disease than people who did not—some researchers think that recent negative findings reveal more about us than they do about fish oil. Omega-3 pills may be beneficial for certain people but not for others, they say, and existing studies may not account for individual differences.There's no question that polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids—the technical name for the good fats found in fish and fish oil—are important parts of a healthy diet. Our bodies can't make them, yet we need them to survive, as they form part of our cell membranes. Although the mechanism by which they might prevent heart disease, cognitive decline and depression isn't well understood, research suggests that they reduce blood pressure and inflammation and that they increase brain blood flow and give neurons structural strength.And no one questions the World Health Organization's recommendation (pdf) that pregnant and nursing women should consume at least 300 milligrams of omega-3s daily to boost fetal brain development. "That [benefit] has been clearly demonstrated in trials," says Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at Harvard University, who studies fish oil.But for other adults, the health benefits of supplementing have become much harder to gauge. That's in part because many of us get lots of these good fats from our diet anyway: According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, per capita fish consumption has doubled (pdf) since 1961, and "more consumption doesn't really add much bang for your buck," Mozaffarian says. In other words, adding more omega-3s to an already omega-3–rich diet does not do much good, a fact that could help explain why recent studies have been more equivocal than studies from several decades ago, when fish was less popular. "We have no evidence from populations whose dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids may be low and who may therefore benefit from supplementation," says Alan Dangour, head of the nutrition group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and co-author of the recent Cochrane review. In addition, preliminary research suggests that certain ethnic groups—such as Japanese and Italians—may benefit more from omega-3 supplements than others, perhaps in part because of how well their bodies absorb the fats.Another potential problem is that most of the research on fish oil and heart health—including all of the trials included in the recent JAMA analysis—have involved subjects who already have heart disease or established risk factors. Whereas this isn't necessarily a problem in itself, it means that very little research has addressed whether fish oil supplements benefit healthy people. "The jury is still out on whether omega-3 supplements can prevent a first cardiovascular event in people at usual risk," says JoAnn Manson, an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who is conducting a trial to answer this question, which she estimates will be finished in 2016.Moreover, because so many trials have involved subjects with heart problems, subjects in recent years have been "taking multiple medications, such as aspirin and statins, which can obscure the effects of supplements," Manson says. (Half of the studies included in the JAMA analysis were conducted after statins became commonplace.) This fact could also help explain the outcome discrepancies between recent trials and older ones carried out during the pre-statin era. Indeed, a February 2012 analysis of a large European clinical trial reported that fish oil supplements do not prevent second heart attacks among people taking statins, but that it cuts risk by half among people who don't take the medications. (Because there were so few non-statin users enrolled in the trial, this finding did not quite reach statistical significance.)People who enroll in and complete omega-3 trials may differ from typical Americans in important ways, too. "Members of the public who volunteer to join randomized controlled studies are frequently healthier and more active than the average for the population," Dangour says, which could affect outcomes in unknown ways. In addition, he adds, people who drop out of trials are often the sickest, and they might be the ones who would most benefit from supplementation.There's also more than one type of fish oil. Typically, in omega-3 intervention studies, subjects take pills containing a near-equal mixture of two fats, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)—but some research suggests that in certain situations and for certain outcomes, one may be better than the other. For instance, a 2011 meta-analysis concluded that fish oil capsules don't help treat depression, but a group of British and Norwegian researchers challenged these findings, citing evidence that pills containing at least 60 percent EPA do seem to provide mood benefits. Another controversial question is whether the omega-3 dose is important in and of itself or whether the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fats one consumes is more important. (Although omega-6 fats are important for survival, Americans tend to consume far more of these fats than they need.)Finally, whereas the recent JAMA analysis concluded that fish oil has no effect on cardiovascular outcomes, the researchers did find that omega-3s reduced the risk of cardiac death by 10 percent, an effect that was statistically significant (having a "p value" of 0.01). The researchers did not report the finding in their conclusions because they subsequently modified their statistical calculations to account for the fact that they had used the same data set to ask a number of different "exploratory" questions: In this case, does fish oil prevent heart attacks? Strokes? What about sudden cardiac death? The team wanted to tighten their definition of statistical significance to account for the fact that the more questions one asks, the more likely one is to get a positive result by chance. Still, Mozaffarian says, "if you combine all the data and look only at cardiac death, there is a statistically significant benefit. A 10 percent reduction in the number-one cause of death in both men and women in the U.S. is a big deal."So, should you take fish oil pills or not? Most researchers agree that oily fish such as salmon and mackerel are far better way to get your fill of good fats. Many of the early, promising studies on omega-3s involved fish rather than fish oil pills (in one, men who were advised to eat fish were 29 percent less likely to die in the two years following a heart attack than men who were not), and a 2010 study by Columbia University scientists reported that following a Mediterranean diet—which, among other things, is rich in fatty fish—reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease by 34 percent. "Not only may people be benefiting from the omega-3 fatty acids in fish, but the fish may be displacing such foods as hamburgers and quiche from the diet, both high in saturated fat," explains Alice Lichtenstein, director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at Tufts University.If you don't eat fish, then the question of what to do becomes more difficult. Researchers argue that, ultimately, we need more randomized, controlled clinical trials on omega-3 supplements—particularly in healthy people who don't take medications—but these are becoming rare, in part because the supplements will never be big moneymakers. "Generic fish oil is available, so drug companies don't have any strong motivation to fund trials," Mozaffarian says.But despite the murky science, if you don't get omega-3s from other sources—or if you have heart disease risk factors but aren't taking medications—omega-3 pills may still be a good idea. "There's no harm in taking a fish oil supplement, and there could be benefits," Mozaffarian says. "The bottom line is that getting some [omega-3] is better than getting none."Follow Scientific American on Twitter @SciAm and @SciamBlogs.

240	five-ways-romney-still-win-111400350	I first began to write this post on September 12, the day when Mitt Romney was supposed to don the fall collection of campaign clothing and start new and fresh. And then Libya happened, and then the leaked videotape happened, and then came a crunch of state polls showing that almost all routes to electoral victory were blocked by a President with leads outside the margin of error. Gallup's tracking has provided the only comfort data for Boston, so perhaps that's a place to start. But when your pollster has to tell the press not to believe the polls, you know you're looking at an uphill climb to the presidency. Romney has high hurdles ahead of him. But his cause is not lost. Here are five ways he can still win. Some combination of the following events and contingencies will have to intrude upon the race for him to do so, but a Romney/Ryan administration remains within the realm of possibility. Keep in mind: there WILL be natural tightening (as opposed to the political Botox kind) between now and election day.1. Romney has a stellar first debate, which galvanizes his campaign and allows late-breaking independents to finally see the man that Ann Romney so loves dearly. Likelihood: 60 percent. Every Romney route to victory has to include a great first debate, because the first debates tend to matter the most, and because Romney will have a relatively unfiltered opportunity to try to make his case, probably his last. Debate 1 is about domestic policy, and the economy is lackluster. If ever there was a time to step up and force Barack Obama to explain to the American people just what he would do to create jobs -- if ever there was an opportunity to refocus the campaign back onto the jobs issue -- it's on October 3 at the University of Denver. No doubt Romney will be prepared. Jim Lehrer, the moderator, is not going to throw anything Romney's way that he hasn't already anticipated.2. Romney has a human moment. Likelihood: 40%. Yes, I know he is a human being, and I'm one of those reporters who has seen him when the camera is off and I can vouch for the fact that he isn't weird and stilted. But he is so cautious on the campaign trail, so full of anxious energy, that even his scripted soft moments come off as somewhat silly. So he needs someone to give him a bear-hug, or to shed a genuine tear, or to tell a dirty joke -- something entirely spontaneous that expands the comfort zone. From the start, the Obama campaign has tried to portray Romney as too darn unusual to be the president, and that strategy has worked. Clint Eastwood's talking chair routine is not going to cut it. You can hear my eyes roll in their sockets as I type words like "humanizing moment," but the incumbent here is much more of a fully formed character than the challenger, and for people who haven't made up their mind, that matters.3. Convince Democrats that they're going to lose. Likelihood: 30%. The more Democrats think they're going to win, the more enthusiasm their base will have, and the easier it will be for Obama to get to 270 electoral votes on the strength of only marginal independent turn-out. Romney needs to someone juice the game to scare Democrats into thinking that they're going to lose, which will set the ball rolling in the opposite direction. Campaign cues, even what ridiculous anonymous strategists whisper to reporters, matter a lot. Voters pick up on them. At the very least, Romney's campaign needs to enforce messaging standards that DON'T acknowledge the reality that Obama has an edge, and he needs to (somehow) get party strategists who dislike him and are signed on with potential 2016 candidates to shut their traps.4. Iran does something stupid and dangerous; Israel attacks Iran unilaterally. Likelihood: 40%. This is a huge unknown, and it's unseemly to speculate about anything that would involve death and destruction. But the moment Americans become uncomfortable with the way their commander-in-chief handles foreign policy crisis is the moment the challenger can step in with a better solution. Unfortunately, Romney has been fairly vacuous when it comes to foreign policy in general.5. The Medicare argument works. Likelihood: 10%. President Obama's $716b Medicare ... call it an adjustment ... remains a viable political opportunity for Romney, albeit a very risky one. Though the Affordable Care Act cuts payments to hospitals and to private insurers that subsidize special add-on plans to Medicare (Medicare Advantage), it could well persuade a number of doctors to stop accepting Medicare in the first place. Eventually, the market will even out access, but in the short term, there is a grain (but just a grain) of truth in what the Republican ticket likes to say about Medicare. Ignoring the larger truth that Romney-Ryan's plan does a lot more damage to the product, enough scared seniors could swing states like Florida, Iowa, Nevada and Wisconsin.There is no linear path to victory right now for Romney. That has reality-based Republicans scared out of their wits. It has others, like Tim Pawlenty, scrambling for the exits (gracefully). For now, the rest can only grin and bear it.View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	4	4	4	3	4	1	2	4	4	1	3	3	1	1	4	
241	ford-execs-tout-fusion-mulally-stays-mum-succession-003301821--finance	NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co dispatched its top brass, including Chief Executive Alan Mulally, to major U.S. cities on Tuesday to promote the 2013 Fusion, its redesigned family sedan that takes aim at Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> Camry.The second-largest U.S. automaker began shipping the Fusion, which boasts a more athletic design and more fuel economy options, to dealers last week. Ford hopes the third-generation Fusion, coupled with the new Escape crossover launched this spring, will boost its U.S. market share.The media blitz comes as Ford's board of directors develops a succession plan for Mulally, 67. Ford is also cutting costs in Europe, where it expects to lose more than $1 billion this year. Ford's sales in Europe fell 29 percent in August, while overall industry sales dropped 8.5 percent."There is a tremendous decrease in demand, but we're absolutely committed to Europe," Mulally said at a Fusion event in New York. "That will involve some restructuring."The board is looking to name Mark Fields, Ford's head of North and South America, chief operating officer, a sign that he could be the heir apparent to Mulally, a source told Reuters last week.But on Tuesday, Mulally kept a lid on the finer details of Ford's plans for Europe and his own plans for retirement. He said Ford has a strong internal bench of potential leaders and he was "pleased to continue to serve as CEO of Ford.""Please don't vote me off," he joked to reporters.Under Mulally's "One Ford" plan, Ford is moving toward building more cars using fewer platforms, a move that cuts costs but allows Ford to offer more features at a lower price.The Fusion is the latest Ford car to receive a global overhaul, after the Fiesta subcompact and Focus compact car. The Fusion will be sold as the Mondeo in Europe and China. These models share about 75 percent of the same parts.The Fusion competes in the midsize sedan segment of the U.S. auto market, dominated by the Toyota Camry and Honda Motor Co's <7267.T> Accord. Through August, sales in this bread-and-butter segment have risen 26 percent, while overall auto sales are up 15 percent, Ford said."This is a transformational vehicle for our company," J Mays, Ford's chief creative officer, said Monday night at an event in Miami Beach. He compared its impact to the 1955 Thunderbird, the 1962 Lincoln Continental or the 1964 Mustang.The base model of the revamped Fusion will cost $21,000, the same as the base price of the outgoing Fusion, Mays said.TOUTING '47' MPGFord is offering three gasoline-powered versions of the Fusion as well as a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid. In a press release, Ford said the Fusion hybrid gets 47 miles per gallon on the highway and in the city, beating out the Camry hybrid.At the New York event with American Idol host Ryan Seacrest, Mulally held a sign touting the "47" figure. Ford also passed out T-shirts with the Fusion hybrid's fuel economy figures.Boosting fuel efficiency has been a pillar of Ford's vehicle strategy for the past six years. Ford is vying beat Toyota's record on fuel economy with new electrified models this year.Ford must also meet federal government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) target of 54.5 mpg by 2025. This translates to 36 mpg or higher in real world driving, analysts say.The average fuel economy of Ford's cars and trucks for model year 2011 was 21.3 mpg, up from 18 mpg in 2006, U.S. government data shows. The industry average for 2011 was 22.8 mpg.To meet these ambitious standards, Ford is counting on turbocharged engines, start-stop systems, hybrid technology "and something we haven't invented yet," said Raj Nair, Ford's head of product development, at an event near Detroit.Ford plans to cut weight from future models by using lightweight materials. Ford is also designing and making key electric-drive components in-house to cut costs and accelerate development of these technologies.Buyers of the 1.6-liter Fusion with a turbocharged engine can purchase the $295 auto start-stop system, which shuts the engine off when the car is stopped at a light. Ford is looking to provide this option in a larger number of its vehicles.The Fusion also offers a lane-keeping system that alerts a driver if the car drifts into another lane. The Fusion can also parallel park itself, with the active park assist feature."That's been a key point in our turnaround and our success, we've really pushed on being a technology leader and making sure we bring those technologies to the mainstream," Nair said.(This version of the story corrects quotes in the tenth paragraph, changes "transitional" to "transformational.")(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder in New York and Deepa Seetharaman in Detroit; Additional reporting by David Adams in Miami Beach; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Tim Dobbyn)	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	4	3	2	3	2	2	2	3	4
242	former-employee-explains-why-fired-facebook-192903368	Getting fired sucks. Now imagine how it would feel to get canned from Facebook, only to watch it become a social phenomenon and the world's largest social network.[More from Mashable: ‘People Style Watch’ Sells Ads on Its Twitter Page]Noah Kagan has lived through that experience. On Saturday, the AppSumo founder decided to write about his "$100 million dollar lesson" learned, detailing why he was terminated six years ago.Kagan joined Facebook as a product manager in November 2005, and was fired eight months later in June 2006. When he left, the social network was still limited to high school and university students. Facebook started accepting anyone with a valid email address in September 2006.[More from Mashable: Zooka Speaker Bar Makes Any Bluetooth Device Sound Better [REVIEW]]He described the reasons for his dismissal like this: He was selfish, accidentally leaked company secrets to TechCrunch and didn't address his weaknesses as a product manager. "I wasn’t great at planning or product management at this time. Fix them or move to another position," Kagan wrote.The serial entrepreneur worked exceptionally well as an employee in a 30-person company, but had a hard time adjusting as Facebook grew to 150 employees. He described himself as a "show-er" at Facebook or "someone who can be good for the company where they are now, but NOT where they are going." "Growers," or employees who can grow with the company and adjust to changes, are the ones who are successful, he said.While at Facebook, Kagan admits he used the company's name too much for his own personal gain. Employees should not rely on the brand, but rather just make "amazing stuff," he added. Kagan suggests the key to success is being a humble employee, listening during group collaboration meetings and being mindful of how you can improve as a part of a team."Constantly ask yourself how can I make the company more valuable," he wrote. "You do that and you will never get fired, unless you do something really stupid or the company goes out of business."Read the rest of Kagan's brutally honest blog post here.Here's a picture of a "note from Zuck" to Kagan, written on the title page of The Elements of Style, the quintessential writing guide by William Strunk Jr. and E.B.

244	four-arrested-over-wave-kidnappings-mozambique-152752022--sector	MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique police have arrested four men accused of running a kidnapping ring behind more than 20 abductions in the capital Maputo in the past year.The alleged ring-leader, Bakhir Ayoob, is the son-in-law of Mohamed Bachir Suleman, a wealthy businessman in the city. Washington has branded Suleman a drug kingpin and in 2010 banned U.S. companies from having any financial dealings with him.Wealthy Muslims have been the main targets of the kidnappings, which began in November. All those abducted were released after ransoms were paid.When a 17 year-old girl was kidnapped last month, Muslims in the city threatened to strike in protest at what they said was a lack of government action.Police detained Ayoob, 30, at his home early on Friday. He is the highest-profile suspect of 20 men arrested in connection with the kidnappings.The abductions are part of a wider crime wave targeting wealthy foreigners who have moved into Maputo on the back of a flood investment into the southern African nation's vast coal and natural gas reserves.	2	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	1	2	1	1	2	2	4
245	four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health	A new study on the genomics of breast cancer confirms that there are four distinct genetic types of the disease, suggesting that some drugs already used to treat cancer in other parts of the body could possibly be used to treat certain forms of breast cancer that share the same genetic abnormalities.The researchers, whose findings were published Sunday in the journal Nature, studied the DNA of breast cancer tumors of 825 patients at various stages of the disease, and found that the disease could be stratified into four major genetic categories.The study, a collaborative effort between 348 researchers, is part of a larger project known as the Cancer Genome Atlas, which is mapping the genetic changes in 20 cancers, including breast cancer. The new study, part of the largest breast cancer genomic project, offers the largest pool of data for researchers who have known for decades that there were genetic subtypes of breast cancer."This again reconfirms on a larger scale the heterogeneity that exists between each patient's breast cancer," said Dr. Ben Park, associate professor of oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. Park was not involved in the study.The genetic analysis not only included a comprehensive look at the inherited basis for the cancers but also examined how proteins expressed within the genes affected the type of cancers that were classified."We now understand the recoding of the genome that is behind [these cancers]," said Dr. Matthew Ellis, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, and a researcher on the study. The Cancer Genome Atlas work "lays the foundation for a new and much more informed approach to developing cures for all our patients," he said.In particular, researchers found that one type of the disease, more commonly known as triple negative breast cancer, genetically resembles a form of ovarian cancer that is currently treatable. Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive and deadly form of the disease that responds to chemotherapy but has high rates of relapse.But clinicians caution that it will take years for these initial genetic findings to change the course of treatment for breast cancer, which is expected to kill nearly 40,000 women in 2012, according to the American Cancer Society."You would need to treat a large number of patients with this profile to see whether the hypothesis works," said Dr. Jay Brooks, chairman of the department of hematology and oncology at Ochsner Clinic Foundation and Hospital in Baton Rouge, La. Brooks was not affiliated with the study.According to many breast cancer experts, the findings confirm that cancers should be defined and treated according to their genetic components rather than their location in the body."For a lot of physicians, breast cancer is breast cancer is breast cancer. And the problem is, it isn't," said Brooks. "This is the future of the way we will identify malignancies and the best sort of therapy."These classifications may eventually guide clinicians to prescribe more personalized treatments for breast cancer patients according to the type of the disease they have."Certainly breast cancer patients will want to know whether this study leads to a different clinical approach to the management of their disease, and for now, this is not the case," said Brooks.For now, the genomic information offers researchers a more definitive understanding of breast cancer, and hope that once the specific type is identified in a patient, a clinician can, eventually, offer an arsenal of personalized treatments."Without the ability to understand the various types, we are not able to develop personalized medicine to treat them or develop ways to effectively prevent them," said Lillian Shockney, administrative director of the Breast Center at Johns Hopkins.	4	3	3	3	4	4	3	3	3	2	3	2	1	1	3	4

"The fight goes on."Strauss-Kahn was about to announce he would run for the French presidency when police arrested him in May 2011 in New York after a hotel maid alleged he had tried to rape her.New York prosecutors dropped those charges, citing concerns about the credibility of the accuser, but hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo is now pursuing him in a civil case and his legal battles have piled up since his return to France.In the so-called Carlton Affair, named after a luxury hotel in the northern French city of Lille, investigators are trying to establish whether Strauss-Kahn participated in sex parties to a degree that amounted to actively encouraging prostitution.Having sex with prostitutes in France is not illegal but pimping is.(Reporting by Pierre Savary in Lille and Brian Love in Paris; Editing by Andrew Osborn)	3	3	4	3	4	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	2	3	3	4
248	france-germany-seek-common-position-eads-bae-125648476--finance	BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The leaders of France and Germany will seek a common position at a series of meetings this week on a $45 billion defense merger that could involve them having to giving up strategic influence in aerospace group EADS .After talks on a tie-up between EADS and Britain's BAE Systems were leaked last week, government officials from across Europe have this week been setting out their views on the deal.While no government has spoken out directly against the merger, and officials seem to see benefits in creating a company that would have far more weight on the world stage, there are concerns that too many demands from politicians could result in the deal being scrapped.Angela Merkel said on Wednesday she planned to discuss the matter with French President Francois Hollande at a meeting on Saturday.Sources had said there would already be preparatory high-level talks on Thursday and Friday. A "pre-decision" for a common position with France could be taken at these preparatory talks, one source said.A combination of BAE and Airbus owner EADS would overtake U.S. rival Boeing as the world's biggest aerospace and defense company in terms of sales.GERMAN JOBSChancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government has not yet come up with a unified position on the talks, though some German politicians want guarantees for German jobs and to see some activities being headquartered in Germany."It cannot be that a Franco-British company is created out of a Franco-German company," Joachim Pfeiffer, a spokesman for Merkel's CDU party told Reuters on Wednesday, saying that he would not accept it if the merged company based its commercial activities in Toulouse and its defense operations in London.EADS employs almost 50,000 people in Germany at 29 different sites. German media reports this week that EADS boss Tom Enders offered job guarantees to the group's 20,000 defense workers have been dismissed as "nonsense" by officials and by EADS.In the state of Bavaria, where EADS employs 15,000 people, the regional economy minister said a merger might improve the firms' competitive position but his focus was on securing jobs.Keeping jobs and technology expertise within Europe's largest economy should be a key factor for the government in deciding whether to approve the deal, a politician from the German opposition Social Democrats said on Wednesday."There seems to be some advantages," Hubertus Heil told a German radio station, adding that the government should make an unbiased review of the economic benefits.NEW PROSPECTSOne of the benefits for EADS in joining with BAE is that it would dissolve a cumbersome shareholder pact dictating that the percentage of shares held by German and French investors must be equal.For France though, a combination of EADS with Britain's BAE could result in it having to give up influence in a company it has controlled since it was set up, as it would see its stake in the combined group shrink to 9 percent from 15 percent currently.For Britain, the key is to ensure that the creation of a European group would not affect BAE's strong sales in the United States, which have benefited from the "special relationship" between the two countries."If the deal goes ahead it would open up new prospects for Europe in the defense market," Elisabeth Guigou, head of the French parliament's foreign affairs committee, told Reuters. She added though that completing such huge merger deals was "not easy" and that negotiations would likely take a long time.EADS and BAE have said they will offer the governments of France, Germany and Britain a "golden share" in the new company, which sources say is aimed at preventing a hostile takeover.Currently, Berlin does not hold a direct stake in EADS, but is in talks to acquire a 7.5 percent holding from carmaker Daimler through state development bank KfW.These talks have now stalled, a German government source told Reuters. However, if France holds on to its stake in a merged group, then Germany would likely strive for the same.(Reporting by Gernot Heller; additional reporting by Emmanuelle Jarry and Julien Ponthus; Writing by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Mike Nesbit)	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	1	1	3	4
249	frances-muhammad-cartoons-divert-anger-away-u-175400907	A French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, has published several offensive caricatures of Islam's Prophet Muhammad, threatening to fuel outrage in the Muslim world first sparked by an obscure anti-Islam film made in the U.S. The Parisian weekly had intended to mock the violent response to the video, with a cover featuring "an Orthodox Jew pushing a turbaned Muhammad in a wheelchair and the headline: 'You must not laugh.'" Now, the French government fears the cartoons will only give rioters an excuse to turn their rage on French embassies after a week of attacking American diplomatic posts, including the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. France has ordered its embassies and schools closed in 20 countries on Friday, the Muslim prayer day, which often serves as an occasion for large protests. Will the French cartoons, seen as blasphemous by many Muslims, shift the focus of the riots onto France, or merely provoke renewed attacks on the U.S.?Now it's France's turn: It looks like the U.S. will no longer "command the full attention of angry Muslims marching in the streets," says Ed Morrissey at Hot Air. So thanks for that, Charlie Hebdo. The magazine should have known what was coming — its offices were firebombed last year after publishing cartoons ridiculing Islam. The French government is trying to prevent the worst by "clamping down on protest," but, if recent history is any guide, that won't stop extremists from taking a swipe at their new target."France's turn?"SEE MORE: Why some U.S. conservatives are siding with an anti-Islam filmmaker: 5 theoriesThere's still plenty of heat on the U.S.: Judging by the first demonstrations after the cartoons came out, says Agence France Presse, the U.S. is not off the hook. Protesters in Lebanon, for instance, are certainly angry over the French cartoons, but, if anything, the rage they're focusing on the U.S. has only intensified. Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Islamist group Hezbollah, even went so far as to call the film blamed for triggering the riots, Innocence of Muslims, "the worst attack ever on Islam." "Hezbollah supporters demonstrate in Tyre, warn U.S. and France"The entire West is the target, and always was: Closing embassies won't spare France, says David Frum at The Daily Beast. "The people who instigate these protests seek a very particular goal: an extension of Egyptian and Pakistani style blasphemy laws into the West." France can't budge on this, nor can the U.S. "The right to ridicule religion" is one of things that defines a free society.

"I know that all over the world, in China, in the United States, in Russia, they're already looking for someone to beat my record."Marchand lives alone, drives a car, makes his own meals and cleans his apartment with no help. The wiry centenarian says he never smoked, but otherwise indulged a healthy appetite for wine and women throughout his life.His uncommon vitality has piqued the interest of scientists at the Inserm public research institute, who examine Marchand every three months to try to understand the secret to his longevity and well-being."They told me I had the constitution of a 55-year-old man, they think it's genetic," he said, laughing. "I have never deprived myself of anything: not wine, not food, not women, but always with moderation."Asked if he planned to get any performance-enhancing help for his race, Marchand said: "The only doping for me is water with a spoonful of honey that I put in my canteen - and that's it.""If I was doping, though, maybe I could hit 35 km/h."(Reporting By Catherine Lagrange; Writing by Nick Vinocur, editing by Paul Casciato)	5	5	5	5	4	2	2	3	4	2	4	2	3	1	5	
251	french-muslim-leader-urges-calm-mohammad-cartoons-republished-080329135	PARIS (Reuters) - The main agency representing Muslims in France appealed for calm on Friday as a new print run of cartoons featuring a naked Prophet Mohammad hit newsstands, raising fears of protests on prayers day around the Islamic world.The drawings in satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo risk stoking a furor over a film mocking the Prophet, which provoked the storming of U.S. and other Western embassies, the killing of the U.S. envoy to Libya and a suicide bombing in Afghanistan.French embassies, schools and cultural centers were shut in some 20 Muslim countries, on orders issued from Paris after the cartoons were first published.In the French capital, police were on alert after protests planned by some Muslim groups were banned.Mohammed Moussaoui, leader of the French Muslim Council (CFCM), described both the film and the cartoons as "acts of aggression" but appealed to French Muslims not to take to the streets for wildcat protests."I repeat the CFCM's call not to protest - any protest could be hijacked and counterproductive," Moussaoui told French radio station RFI.Charlie Hebdo, an anti-establishment weekly whose Paris offices are under police protection, defied critics to rush out another run of the publication that caused outrage and sold out in minutes last Wednesday. It says the cartoons are designed simply to poke fun at the uproar over the film.The cartoons have sparked little street anger in France so far, but French authorities are concerned they could compound the worldwide fury over the privately funded, California-made video depicting Prophet Mohammad as a lecher.French media showed TV footage of an embassy protected by soldiers and masses of barbed wire in North African former colony Tunisia, where the Islamist-led government has also decreed a ban on protests over the cartoons.About 100 Iranians protested outside the French embassy in Tehran on Thursday.(Reporting By Brian Love; editing by Mark John, John Stonestreet)	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	4	3	2	3	3	3

253	gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954	A new crowdfunding platform that focuses solely on video games launched Tuesday morning, and offers gamers a chance to invest in titles vetted by a team of industry experts.[More from Mashable: Why Tech and New Media Can Help End Modern Slavery]Gambitious functions like a donation-based platform, such as Kickstarter. It allows people living in the European Union and eventually the U.S. to invest equity into games, and receive returns on their investment.Unlike Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, however, Gambitious doesn't let just anyone submit a project for funding. The company's staff must first meet with the game's creators to make sure they have a working business plan and solid roadmap for their project before going forward. Gambitious founders Mike Wilson and Harry Miller say they are worried about the future of crowdfunding for games, and want to make sure potential backers don't get burned out.[More from Mashable: There’s No ‘White Space’ in This Entrepreneur’s Calendar]"We're starting to see press about the backlash about people getting sick of being hit up for donations. A lot of these games are never going to come out. A lot of these guys have never done it before, and they have no publishing or platform connections. They have no publishers backing them, and they have no idea what it actually means to finish and ship a game," says Wilson, who has spent almost two decades in the industry. He previously worked at companies such as id Software, Gathering of Developers and Gamecock Media Group.Much of this Kickstarter gold rush has to do with developer Double Fine's uber-successful campaign to make a point-and-click adventure game. The company raised $3.3 million back in February, and Kickstarter has said seven of the first 10 projects to reach the $1 million funding goal were game-related.Miller says quick success has given independent developers big dreams, but adds that they may not have the ability or money to fulfill them all. Many costs that crop up later surprise the developers, he says, such as marketing, or even creating special rewards for Kickstarter backers."Every little thing costs money. It hurts them terribly in the end, when they didn't plan for it."Cosmic DJ is one of the titles looking for funding at Gambitious' launch. It's a unique music-tablet game that challenges players to try and create better music than their friends. Matt Piersall, who is working on the game, says that when the developers realized they needed funding, Kickstarter didn't seem like a great option."It's really hard to get noticed on Kickstarter, and it's a full-time job of the developer to make sure the campaign runs smoothly," he says.With Gambitious, Wilson and Miller say their goal is to make sure smaller developers, especially first-timers, understand what they are getting into, while also making sure the game's consumers can donate or invest in a basic business plan, at minimum."It's not to say that a team of inexperienced people can't do this, but we want to make sure they have a plan," Wilson says, adding that Gambitious already has contracts with marketing, public relations, voice acting and music services.The duo will soon have another group to educate: potential investors. Wilson says the passage of the JOBS Act means that it will only be a few months before U.S. residents can invest in private companies. Investors on Gambitious can only invest in the game the company is making -- not the developers themselves -- but they can still get returns if a game sells well."The average age for a gamer each year goes up; now it's near 40. People near 40 invest while having more money in their pockets. Why not invest in something that you're passionate in?" Wilson says.Gambitious launched seven projects from around Europe and the United States, with plans to add more. Wilson says he expects to see a big push when investment opportunities open to the U.S. For now, anyone outside the EU can use the site in the same way they would any other crowdfunding platform.While developers may find the application more stringent than other crowdfunding sites, Wilson says he hopes they will see the reasoning behind it."We ask them to create a business plan to go with their project. It'd be same if they were pitching an investor for any idea. Anyone can fill out the application and submit a business plan. It's not for us to know if things would sell, but we make them think it through."Do you think crowdfunding is sustainable for video games?

The video has been viewed more than 267 million times on Youtube since it was released in mid-July."The positive sentiment from 'Gangnam Style' has attracted investors just because of the fact that the company is owned by Psy's father and uncle," said Lee Sun-tae, a researcher at NH Investment and Securities, who added Psy is not a shareholder in the company."The popularity will slowly dissolve in time, naturally."South Korea's legion of retail investors, mainly middle-aged people, tend to jump on speculative stocks.Software millionaire Ahn Cheol-soo, who this month announced he would run for the country's presidency, saw the value of his company Ahnlab Inc.'s shares slide after his bid.Ahnlab stock was down 30 percent on Tuesday compared with its closing level a week ago, just a day before he made his announcement.(Reporting by Christine Kim; Editing by David Chance and Daniel Magnowski)	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	3	2	2	3	1	1	1	3	4

256	georgian-president-concedes-democracy-rules-173637806	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Defying expectations, President Mikhail Saakashvili conceded Tuesday that his party had lost Georgia's parliamentary election and his opponent had the right to become prime minister, setting the stage for political turmoil in the final year of his presidency.The new Georgian government will be led by billionaire businessman and philanthropist Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia and until recently was little known to the 4.5 million people in his homeland on the Black Sea.In one notable accomplishment, it was the first time in Georgia's post-Soviet history that the government changed by the ballot box rather than through revolution. Saakashvili came to power through the peaceful Rose Revolution after a rigged parliamentary vote in 2003.By conceding defeat even before the results of Monday's election were released, the 44-year-old Saakashvili defied the opposition's expectations that he would cling to power at all costs and preserved his legacy as a pro-Western leader who brought democracy to the former Soviet republic.He also prevented potential violence on the emotionally charged streets of the capital, Tbilisi, where support for the opposition Georgian Dream coalition is strongest. Opposition supporters began celebrating as soon as the polls closed, and the mood could have turned ugly very quickly if they thought they were being deprived of a victory.The 56-year-old Ivanishvili, meanwhile, went immediately on the attack. Speaking at a televised news conference, he declared that most of the president's widely praised reforms were a joke and said Saakashvili had deceived the Americans into believing he was a democrat. He then called on Saakashvili to resign."I don't think our political battle was caused by any personal antagonism on my part toward Saakashvili," he said. "But I have always blamed Saakashvili for what has gone wrong in Georgia, and I can repeat that today: This man's ideology has established a climate of lies, violence and torture."During his nearly nine years in power, Saakashvili has pushed through economic and political reforms and attracted international investment that has led to dramatic economic growth. Poverty and unemployment, however, remain painfully high.Still, many Georgians have turned against Saakashvili in recent years. Many accuse his United National Movement party — which has controlled not only the government and Parliament but also the courts and prosecutor's office — of exercising authoritarian powers.Saakashvili's campaign was also hit hard by the release two weeks ago of shocking videos showing prisoners in a Tbilisi jail being beaten and sodomized. The government moved quickly to stem the anger, replacing Cabinet ministers blamed for the abuse and arresting prison staff, but many saw the videos as illustrating the excesses of his government.In his televised concession speech, the president said there were deep differences between his party and the diverse opposition coalition."We think their views are completely wrong," he said. "But democracy works through the majority of the Georgian people making a decision, and we respect this very much."Saakashvili will remain as the leader of Georgia until his second and last term ends in October 2013. Under a constitutional reform that goes into effect after he leaves office, many of the president's powers will be transferred to the prime minister, who is chosen by Parliament.Alexander Rondeli, a Georgian political analyst, said the antagonism between Saakashvili and his future prime minister threatened to create a political storm."Both the president and Ivanishvili have stated, not very willingly, but they have stated their readiness to work together," Rondeli said. "But on Ivanishvili's team are people who, metaphorically speaking, want Saakashvili's head. Whether he will be able to resist their influence only time will tell."Saakashvili was under pressure to hold a democratic election and prevent the kinds of violations believed to have boosted his results in the past. This message was reinforced by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during a visit in June, when she told him that the "the single best thing Georgia can do to advance your security, your prosperity, your democracy, your international reputation, is to hold free and fair elections that result in a fully democratic transition."More than 400 international observers monitored the election. They expressed concern over the harsh rhetoric during the campaign and isolated cases of violence, but said Tuesday the election process had showed "a healthy respect for fundamental freedoms at the heart of democratic elections."Ivanishvili has confirmed his commitment to pursue Saakashvili's goals of making Georgia an integral part of Europe and member of NATO, while adding he will seek to restore the trade and diplomatic ties with Russia that were severed when the two countries fought a brief war in 2008.Georgian producers of wine, mineral water, vegetables and fruits had depended on exports to Russia, and the closing of those markets hurt them deeply.The businessman has denied Saakashvili's accusations that he intends to put Georgia back under Russian domination.Before Saakashvili conceded, Ivanishvili met with two U.S. senators to assure them of his desire to maintain the close relationship with Washington that Saakashvili forged."We talked about the future, how to develop our relationship with our big friend (the United States), and how to develop democracy in Georgia," he said after meeting with Republican Sen. James Risch of Idaho and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, both members of the Foreign Relations Committee.In Russia, where the election was being watched closely, the government welcomed Saakashvili's defeat. He and Russian President Vladimir Putin have had a deep enmity since the 2008 war that left Georgia battered.Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the opposition victory would bring "more constructive and responsible" people to parliament. He said the Kremlin political party was "ready for dialogue about the future of Russian-Georgian relations."Alexei Malashenko, a scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center, was more cautious."For a while, ties will soften, there will be a prospect of improvement, but an exchange of embassies is not possible yet," he said.One of the main obstacles is the status of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which Russia has recognized as independent. Georgia lost its last remaining territory in both provinces as a result of the 2008 war and bristles at the Russian troops stationed there.___Misha Dzhinzhikhashvili in Tbilisi and Mansur Mirovalev in Moscow contributed reporting.	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4	3	2	3	3	3	4	4	
257	german-french-leaders-discuss-eads-banking-union-153300338--finance	BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande will scrutinize plans by EADS and BAE Systems to form an aerospace and defense giant on Saturday but are unlikely to give final go-ahead to a merger fraught with economic and security concerns.Airbus-maker EADS is anxious for stakeholders France and Germany to set out their position on the merger, and has warned that if Berlin and Paris's approval is tied to too many conditions it could abandon the proposed $45 billion union.Under British stock market rules, EADS and BAE have until October 10 to announce whether they will go ahead. A German government spokesman said on Friday no decisions were expected during the leaders' working lunch in Ludwigsburg.Sources familiar with discussions say that without a clear political direction it is unlikely the companies will be ready to present a detailed plan in time for that deadline and it is increasingly likely they will seek an extension.Executives of both firms are engaged in a hectic charm offensive directed at political leaders, but investors fear a lack of synergies and that heavy state interference could hamstring the future company.The political message coming out of the Franco-German meeting will be closely watched in Britain, where sources close to BAE have signaled it will not go ahead with the deal if governments are able to interfere in the day-to-day management of the enlarged company.The chancellor, who this week described her relationship with France's new Socialist leader as a "trusting" one, will also discuss proposals - opposed by Berlin but largely backed by France - for the European Central Bank to oversee all euro zone banks.The summit marks a speech in Ludwigsburg by French leader General Charles de Gaulle 50 years ago when, in fluent German learned as a prisoner of war during World War I, he pledged reconciliation and respect.The alliance has been strained since conservative Nicolas Sarkozy's replacement by Hollande, whose calls for more growth measures are seen as a rebuff to Merkel's austerity agenda."Each time there has been a change in the Franco-German leadership couple there have been teething problems, but each time the different personalities have found a way to work together," said a senior French diplomat. "This time the crisis has added a sense of urgency."The pair has managed to show unity, such as in their joint message for Greece last month saying there can be no leeway on its bailout terms unless Athens sticks to tough reform targets."I think their relationship has developed well, they've made an effort to get on after so many warned of trouble ahead," said Ulrike Guerot at the European Council on Foreign Relations.MERGER HEADACHEDe Gaulle, who in the 1960s withdrew France from NATO's military command, symbolized French efforts to have its own defense capability with an industry to match. But soaring development costs and measly national budgets compared to the United States have forced European defense planners and firms to cooperate.France has kept a foot in both camps, working with Germany to set up EADS but maintaining its own defense supply base to support Dassault Aviation , whose Rafale combat jet competes with the Eurofighter led by EADS and BAE.Safeguarding jobs, a source of past Franco-German conflict in EADS, will feature highly at Ludwigsburg which is just a few hours' drive from a dozen EADS sites ranging from a helicopter maintenance firm in Baden Baden to a radar developer in Ulm.France's European Affairs Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has said there are "a huge number of obstacles to clear" before a merger could be achieved, but he has also noted the strategic logic of creating a European defense champion."Bringing together our defense industries so as to have an industrial base for defense which, in Europe, would allow us to take on the international competition is a necessity if we want to have a meaningful European security and defense policy."Commenting on EADS on Thursday, French sources said: "It's obvious we will be looking at this project from the point of view of its ability to create employment, notably in France."SUPERVISION ROWOn the ECB's new bank oversight remit, Germany's view that this should be limited to systemically-relevant and cross-border institutions falls far short of the European Commission's more extensive proposal, which is backed by Paris.Giving the ECB a bigger role is part of the euro zone's efforts to provide a long-term fix for its sovereign debt crisis, providing better supervision and safeguarding bank stability in sovereign states that get into difficulties.French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said on Wednesday he saw room to bridge differences on the timing and the scale of the reforms, calling it "simplistic to characterize this as some kind of clash".

We don't have a choice, but to march toward the destiny that is ours, march toward a unified Europe," he added.Europe's 17-nation currency zone is experiencing a deep crisis, Hollande said, therefore urging Germany and other nations to help "create instruments that make us stronger: the budgetary union, the banking union, the social union, a political union."Merkel said both countries will and must work together closely to strengthen Europe to weather those new challenges."However great the economic challenges may be. It remains and will remain valid: We Europeans are united in the pursuit of our happiness," she said.France's then-leader Charles de Gaulle in 1962 addressed German youth in Ludwigsburg — speaking in German — in a speech that was hailed as a major step toward building German-French ties, after the nations had fought each other in both world wars, and were often referred to as arch-enemies.De Gaulle and his German counterpart Konrad Adenauer started the reconciliation efforts in the aftermath of World War II.Merkel said the two leaders, who had witnessed themselves the horrors of war, laid the foundation of Europe's unification in bringing together their nations "who were long said to be arch-enemies — what a terrible word." They were convinced that "natural enmity between people could not exist," she added.The two countries' rapprochement evolved to become a motor of Europe's integration less than two decades after World War II. France and Germany, representing almost half of the eurozone's economic output, are still seen as key players in forging European policies.Addressing the youth of both nations, Hollande concluded his speech in German, saying "it is now your role to make the European dream a reality and give it a future."___Juergen Baetz can be reached on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jbaetz	4	4	4	3	4	3	2	3	3	1	2	2	2	2	4	
259	germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430	BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany launched a national register of neo-Nazis on Wednesday as it takes steps to tackle failings that allowed known extremists to wage a seven-year racist killing spree.The discovery of a small neo-Nazi cell in the former East German town of Zwickau last year and evidence linking it to the killings caused profound shame in Germany and highlighted its shortcomings in fighting right-wing extremism.The existence of the cell, calling itself the Nationalist Socialist Underground (NSU), only came to light by chance after two members committed suicide following a botched bank robbery, and a female accomplice torched an apartment used by the gang.Germany plans an overhaul its intelligence services in the wake of the NSU murders, but some experts say what is needed most is a fundamental change in approach in a country whose Nazi past makes right-wing militancy a sensitive subject."The new database will be of use, but it doesn't help with the fundamental problem which is that this data must be properly scrutinized, and immediately investigated. The fact this didn't happen is what led to the catastrophic failures," said Hajo Funke, an expert on Germany's far-right.Underestimating the far-right threat is a long running trend, he said."For too long intelligence agencies saw the enemy elsewhere. During Cold War times they monitored the leftists, anarchists and punks. The far right simply wasn't on their radar. In some quarters there may have also been some sympathy for the far-right within their ranks."Since late last year a depressing picture has emerged of missed chances and missed leads as the group engaged in a killing spree from 2000-2007, murdering eight Turks, a Greek and a German policewoman.Authorities hope the new register will ensure intelligence on far-right extremists is properly shared between the police forces and domestic intelligence services across German states.The register is modeled on a database of radical Islamists that has been in operation for several years."The aim of this is to develop an effective fight against far-right extremism in this country ... and in this way to ensure that what has happened can never happen again," Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said at the launch of the register in eastern Berlin.However obstacles faced by an inquiry into the killings show that progress may be difficult. The probe has been undermined by agencies withholding or even destroying information.In July the head of Germany's domestic intelligence service resigned after admitting that an official within his agency had shredded files on the NSU. This week Berlin's Interior Senator expressed regret for not sharing with the inquiry that an informant of the Berlin Office of Criminal Investigation had warned years earlier that he had information about the NSU.Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has apologized to the families of the murder victims for the catalogue of neglect and errors, said on Monday the inquiry was not proceeding as it should.Experts say far-right extremism is a particular threat among disenchanted young people in Germany's eastern regions where unemployment is high.Police have reopened all unsolved cases with a possible racist motive since 1998 amid fears that security services underplayed the far-right threat, or used unreliable informants.(Reporting by Alexandra Hudson; Editing by Rosalind Russell)	4	4	3	3	4	2	2	4	3	2	3	2	1	3	3	4
260	germanys-top-mail-order-pharmacy-files-insolvency-180612183	FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Sanicare, Germany's largest mail-order pharmacy, has filed for insolvency due to problems that have arisen following the recent death of its founder and head, the company said on Wednesday.A statement said the insolvency was for the mail-order pharmacy activities of the company and would not affect the rest of Sanicare's businesses, which include the online unit.The mail-order business would be run by court-appointed administrator Ralph Buenning after the family of founder and former head Johannes Moenter filed for insolvency on September 25 with the court in Osnabrueck city.The statement quoted Buenning as saying he was looking for an investor for the mail-order unit, which employs 342 staff.Buenning said the insolvency has arisen due to complexities of the company's organizational structure as well as uncertainties surrounding the will of Moenter, who died on September 4.According to the website of the European Association of Mail Service Pharmacies, its member Sanicare holds the market leader position in Germany, with nearly 1.2 million customers in the country.It said in 2009 the Sanicare Group had sales of 427 million euros ($548.27 million), with the mail-order business alone generating 197 million euros.(Reporting By Marilyn Gerlach; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)	4	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	2	3	2	1	1	2	3	3
261	golf-rose-blossoms-east-lake-fast-finish-204236890--golf	ATLANTA, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Britain's Justin Rose sank a curling birdie putt from 52 feet at the par-three last to grab an early one-shot lead in Thursday's opening round of the elite Tour Championship.The Englishman watched in amazement as his ball dropped into the cup after breaking sharply from left to right downhill to cap a four-under-par 66 at East Lake Golf Club.While world number one Rory McIlroy and 14-times major winner Tiger Woods attracted the biggest galleries of the day in the final pairing, Rose covered the back nine in three under to take control of the PGA Tour's fourth and final playoff event.Long-hitting Scott Piercy, who briefly led the elite 30-man field by two strokes before double-bogeying the 18th, carded a 67 to finish level with fellow American Bo Van Pelt.Australian Adam Scott and Americans Hunter Mahan and Robert Garrigus opened with 68s while Ryan Moore and tour veteran Jim Furyk, also of the United States, returned 69s.FedExCup points leader McIlroy, bidding for a fifth PGA Tour victory this year, and his fourth in just five starts, was at one under after 12 holes. Woods was at three under.Rose, who clinched his fourth PGA Tour victory at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in March, was delighted to limit potential damage arising from erratic form off the tee with a sizzling putting display.'BIGGER PREMIUM'"You've got to keep a much bigger premium of hitting it on the fairway here, and I didn't do a great job of that today," Rose told reporters after missing seven of 14 fairways while totalling only 26 putts."That's something I can improve on in the next few rounds. If I keep it on the fairway, I feel my iron game and short game is coming around."I'm beginning to get some confidence with the putter, so it was nice to get out of today with a hot start, considering that."For Rose to land the season-long FedExCup and its $10 million bonus, he knows he is a long shot who has to win the Tour Championship and hope that players ranked higher in the points standings finish poorly.Rose was 24th at the start of the week while any of the top five - McIlroy, Woods, Nick Watney, Phil Mickelson and Brandt Snedeker - would automatically secure the trophy with victory on Sunday."Just being here at this tournament is a good feeling," said Rose. "Obviously, I'd like to be much higher up the rankings."Last year I didn't factor in the tournament and this year maybe being a little bit looser out there is going to help me."I've only got this tournament on my mind. A lot of the other guys have two trophies on their minds. I think I'll steal it if I end up winning both of them."

262	golf-ryder-cup-playing-format-182109524--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois, Sept 24 (Reuters) - This week's Ryder Cup between hosts the United States and holders Europe will be played on the par-72 Course No. 3 at Medinah Country Club from Friday to Sunday.Each team has 12 players and a total of 28 matches will take place, culminating with 12 singles on the final day.The first two days will feature a mix of foursomes and fourball matches, with the order of play determined through agreement by United States captain Davis Love III and his European counterpart Jose Maria Olazabal.Foursomes matches involve two-man teams, with each team playing one ball. The players take alternate shots until the hole is completed. The lower of the two scores wins the hole.If the same number of shots on both sides is recorded, the hole is halved.One player will hit the tee shot on odd-numbered holes with his team mate teeing off first on the even-numbered holes.Fourball matches involve two-man teams with each player playing his own ball and completing the hole. The best score of the four wins the hole.In singles matches, the result is decided when one player leads by more holes than there are holes left to play.Team captains submit their order of play before each round to a tournament official. The lists from each captain are then matched, resulting in the pairings. (Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes; Editing by Frank Pingue)	3	3	4	1	3	1	2	2	2	3	2	1	1	1	2	4
263	golf-south-africa-secures-rights-big-money-event-142241747--golf	JOHANNESBURG, Oct 2 (Reuters) - South Africa has secured the hosting rights to golf's new, $8.5-million Tournament of Hope for 10 years, organisers said on Tuesday.The event, announced in February and sanctioned by the world's leading tours, will have a prize fund second only to the Players Championship, which offers $9.5 million.The tournament had been moved forward a week from the date originally planned and would be held from Nov. 21-24 next year on a course yet to be determined, the International Federation of PGA Tours and South Africa's Sunshine Tour said.In February, the federation said the tournament was designed to help raise awareness of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment."Our vision is to ensure that this tournament becomes globally recognised as one of the top tournaments in the world and successfully positions South Africa to an international audience," Brand de Villiers, chairman of tournament promoters SAIL, said in a statement on Tuesday.

264	golf-u-rookies-slip-ryder-cup-shadow-last-024818846--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Three of the four American rookies who seized the Ryder Cup spotlight with their fearless play slipped into the shadows during the decisive singles on Sunday, as Europe claimed a shock victory.Webb Simpson, Brandt Snedeker and Keegan Bradley became instant Ryder Cup darlings with their dazzling debut in the opening foursomes and fourballs on Friday but were mostly invisible on Sunday as Europe stormed back from a 10-6 deficit to take the trophy.The first-timers, who had formed the backbone of the American's 5-3 first day lead and made significant contributions on day two, failed to deliver in the last day pressure cooker with Jason Dufner the only rookie to record a win beating Sweden's Peter Hanson two up."It's hard not to get up in front of these fans with so much at stake in the singles," Dufner told reporters. "I made a couple of nice putts there that kind of got me fired up a little bit."Excited to get that point for the team."Bradley had led the American Ryder Cup team, forming an electrifying partnership with Phil Mickelson that generated three points from three matches but on their own both came up short on Sunday.Bradley absorbed his first Ryder Cup loss falling 2&1 to world number one Rory McIlroy while Mickelson lost one down to Justin Rose in his 38th Ryder Cup match, the most by an American in the biennial competition.Before the Europeans had popped the corks on their champagne, the post-mortem on the 14-1/2 to 13-1/2 loss had begun with Love being quizzed about his move to sit down the red-hot Bradley and Mickelson from Saturday's fourball that may have cost his team a valuable point."In hindsight, we would have done a lot of things differently, I guess," said Love. "These guys asked to do certain things during the week and there are some guys that didn't want to sit out; but guys that felt like they needed to rest, we let them rest."I'm going to second guess myself for a long time. Could have done a lot of things differently."One thing Love will not regret is having four rookies on his squad, Bradley (3-1-0), Dufner (3-1-0), Simpson (2-2-0) and Snedeker (1-2-0) combining to contribute nine points to the U.S. cause.In fact it was the senior members of the team who failed to hold up their end, Jim Furyk (1-2-0), Steve Stricker (0-4-0) and Tiger Woods (0-3-1) managing just one-and-a-half points between them."I tried to remind the guys a little bit yesterday, even after the third session, that the tournament was not even halfway over yet point wise," said Love. "We had a long way to go."We tried to not focus on results but we talked about it a little bit last night; that all we could do was just go out, play one match at a time, everybody go out and have fun, try to win their point."I'm sure there's a lot of great plans in a lot of sporting events that sound really good the night before, before the game starts, and then there's a fumble or a turnover or something happens and it doesn't work."What didn't work today is they played a little bit better than us and got some momentum and made it tough."

266	google-became-worlds-second-most-valuable-tech-company-104000152	Until Apple took the crown in 2010, Microsoft spent many, many years as the world's most valuable technology company. And now, for the first time ever, Google has leapfrogged its Redmond-based rival, too, taking the second place slot behind Tim Cook and Co.'s best-selling iProducts, and relegating Microsoft to the bronze medal podium. The search giant has enjoyed a strong run in recent months — share prices are up 30 percent for the quarter — and has now overtaken Microsoft's $247.27 billion market capitalization, clocking in at one point with a $248.89 billion market cap of its own. (Apple is still way out in front, with a market cap well north of $600 billion.) What accounts for Wall Street's renewed confidence in Google, which as recently as 2007 was seen as a risky investment? Here, four theories:1. Google has a vice-like grip on searchGoogle controls 66 percent of the U.S. search market, says Brian Womack at Bloomberg. Microsoft, which entered the search market in 2009 with Bing, comes in at a "distant second" with 16 percent. And Google's stranglehold on search positions the company to become the biggest online display advertising company in the world. Google's global revenue from online ads is likely to hit $6 billion this year, displacing even first-place Facebook, Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney tells Britain's Financial Times.2. Microsoft's software business has been battered"The PC hardware business is obviously struggling," Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Wedge Partners Corp., tells Bloomberg. That's bad news for Microsoft, which has long made a ton of money with its PC operating system. Although the company still gets most of its revenue from Windows and Office software, sales have slumped as more consumers turn to Android tablets or iPads to handle their home computing needs. Simply put: Customers are looking to the Cloud, not the disk drive.3. Microsoft has yet to prove it can go mobileWindows 8 is set to debut later this month, and while the new operating system "is designed to be Microsoft's first to translate tidily from PCs to smartphones and tablets, Microsoft has spent years failing to prove it gets mobile," says Marcus Wohlsen at Wired. Yes, "Windows 8 looks promising, but it's hard not to picture Microsoft as an old silverback with its arms wrapped around an old Dell desktop." As for Google...4. Android is already everywhereThe search giant is "beating its chest with the success of Android," says Wired's Wohlsen. The mobile operating system runs on more than two-thirds of the world's smartphones shipped during the second quarter. Windows Phone, on the other hand, ran on fewer than 4 percent of the devices shipped during the same period. Today, Google is more than the king of search, says Nick Wingfield at The New York Times. It took some time, but it's clearly that "Google is beginning to convince investors that it is more than a one-trick pony."SEE MORE: Can supermodels make Google glasses cool?View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	4	3	3	2	3	2	2	4	3	2	3	3	1	1	3	
267	google-seen-taking-facebooks-crown-u-display-ads-014344483--sector	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc is set to become the biggest earner in U.S. display ads this year, taking the No. 1 rank away from Facebook Inc and cementing its dominant presence in online advertising.Google's rising clout in display ads - the boxes with images and video found on websites -- has come on the back of growth in video advertising on its YouTube subsidiary, as well as mobile advertising through Admob, a company acquired by Google in 2009.This year, Google will claim 15.4 percent of display ad dollars, or $2.31 billion, compared to Facebook's 14.4 percent, or $2.16 billion, according to projections by eMarketer, a digital advertising research firm.But it added that publishers across the board have been bruised by weaker-than-expected display advertising demand this year as large brands withheld splurging on costly digital campaigns.Top display ad earners Google and Facebook were followed by Yahoo Inc, Microsoft Corp and AOL Inc, which all have advertising networks across their digital content properties.Facebook said this week that it would begin developing a mobile ad network that would allow advertisers to target ads using Facebook data across the web and not just Facebook's website.(Reporting by Gerry Shih; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)	2	2	3	3	2	3	3	2	2	2	2	1	1	1	2	4

270	gout-attacks-pits-eating-cherries-may-help-135654094--abc-news-wellness	If a doctor diagnoses that crushing pain in your big toe as gout, relief just might be a bowl of cherries.A new Boston University study has found that eating about 30 pieces of the sweet fruit within 48 hours of a gout attack may cut the risk of recurrence of the painful arthritic condition by 35 percent.Though anecdotal evidence of gout-healing powers of cherries has been circulating since the 1950s, lead author Yuqing Zhang, professor of medicine and public health at Boston University, said he believed this was the first study to indicate that cherry consumption does indeed reduce gout flare ups.In the study, 633 gout patients were followed online for one year and monitored for their gout symptoms, medications and risk factors as well as their intake of cherries and cherry extracts up to two days before a gout flare up. Eating up to three servings of cherries – about one and a half cups – appeared to be the magic number for preventing a gout attack."However, further cherry intake did not provide any additional beneficial effect," Zhang said.Uric acid is a waste byproduct of metabolism which is normally excreted through the kidneys in urine. When the process is impaired, uric acid accumulates in the blood stream until crystals are deposited in the joints causing the pain, swelling and inflammation associated with gout. It usually attacks the big toes but can sometimes affect the rest of the foot, knees or ankles and less commonly, the elbows and shoulders.More than 8.3 million Americans suffer from the disease. Men, especially older obese men, are the most susceptible though a woman's risk increases after menopause. In earlier studies, Zhang and his team showed that alcohol consumption, a high protein diet and foods such as shellfish which are rich in the chemical purine can also up gout frequency.The secret behind cherries' gout-fighting powers isn't entirely understood. Dr. Allan Gelbar who co-wrote the commentary to the study in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism with Dr. Daniel Solomon, said it could be the vitamin C content of the fruit or perhaps the anti-inflammatory effect of their high antioxidant content."Anthocyanins are an antioxidant pigment found in cherries and other red and purple fruits and vegetables. They seem to stabilize the free radical molecules responsible for causing inflammation and cell and tissue damage."Zhang said one limitation of the study is that it relied on the accuracy of each participant's recall of what they did and ate in the 48 hours before a gout attack. The next step would be to do a trial where some gout sufferers ate cherries while others did not.Gelbar said that anyone who suffers from gout should consider adding cherries to their diet as a preventative measure but shouldn't stop taking their medication. Patients in the study who ate cherries and also took the uric-acid reducing drug, allopurinol, lowered their risk of gout recurrence by up to 75 percent.And, although the study also found cherry extract was useful for lowering the number of gout attacks, the researchers stressed that the sample size – only 15 people – was too small to draw definite conclusions. The FDA has sent a letter to various cherry-based product manufacturers warning them not to use the study results to make claims about the benefits of their products.	5	5	4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	2	2	5	
271	grand-jury-indicts-colorado-man-vacation-investment-scheme-214700372--finance	According to Denver District Attorney Mitchell R. Morrissey, a grand jury has indicted a man today of using more than $8 million of investor money for his personal use. Here are the details.* A Denver Grand Jury returned a 20-count indictment against Brian Wellens, 42, the district attorney stated. Wellens was charged with violating the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act, two counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and 17 counts of securities fraud.* An arrest warrant has been issued for Wellens.* Morrissey stated that the indictment was the result of a joint investigation with the Colorado Division of Securities.* According to the charges, Wellens allegedly took approximately $8.5 million from 19 different investors between 2006 and 2011, promoting vacation investment through his company, Continental Resort Homes.* Instead of using the investment money to purchase vacation properties, the district attorney reported, Wellens allegedly used the money for his personal expenses and other businesses.* According to a November, 2011, report in the Colorado Springs Gazette , the Colorado Division of Securities began investigating Wellens after he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy listing $36.4 million in liabilities owed to 76 creditors and $2.08 million in assets.* Wellens stated during a creditors' meeting that he took more than $2 million from an individual in order to build a vacation home in Mexico, the Gazette reported. However, he never acquired the site or started construction on that home.* According to the Gazette, some of the creditors in his bankruptcy included state House Majority Leader Amy Stephens (R-Monument); state Rep. Bob Gardner (R-Colorado Springs); Colorado Lottery Director Abel Tapia; Vladamir Jones Chairman Nechie Hall and former Colorado Springs entrepreneur Ron Muns.* The violation to the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act is a class 2 felony which carries a penalty for up to 48 years in prison and up to $1 million in fines, according to the Felony Guide for Colorado. The conspiracy charges are class 4 felonies, calling for two to 12 years in prison and up to $500,000 in fines. The securities fraud charges are class 3 felonies, punishable by up to 24 years in prison and up to $750,000 dollars in fines.	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	2	3	1	1	1	3	4
272	group-claims-da-vinci-painted-early-mona-lisa-204936543	GENEVA (AP) — A Zurich-based foundation says it will prove to the world Thursday that Leonardo Da Vinci painted an earlier version of the Mona Lisa.The Mona Lisa Foundation, which owns the "Isleworth Mona Lisa," says that after 35 years of research, experts believe it predates the famed 16th-century masterpiece by about a decade.The Isleworth painting — likewise a portrait of a young woman with an enigmatic smile — is slightly larger, was painted on canvas and has brighter colors than the famed Louvre Museum masterpiece painted on wood.The group is presenting its findings to reporters Thursday in Geneva.An accompanying book to be released by the foundation says the Isleworth Mona Lisa — which was in storage for decades — drew news headlines in the early 20th century.	2	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	1	1	1	2	4

274	guatemalan-massacre-suspect-extradited-us-025901850	LOS ANGELES (AP) — A former Guatemalan soldier accused of being involved in a brutal 1982 massacre during that country's civil war has been extradited to California where he faces immigration fraud charges.Federal authorities say Jose Sosa Orantes was brought to the U.S. Friday from Canada, where he had been in custody on U.S. charges of lying about his role in Guatemala's war when he applied for American citizenship in 2008.Authorities allege Sosa was a member of a Guatemalan military unit known as the "kaibiles" and helped command a unit assigned to track down suspected guerrillas who had stolen military weapons.Sosa and other soldiers stormed a village in Guatemala in 1982 and allegedly killed men, women and children during the search.Guatemala's civil war claimed at least 200,000 lives before it ended in 1996.	2	2	3	3	2	2	1	2	2	1	2	1	1	3	2	4

Residents of Garissa said an explosion, followed by gunshots, were heard on the street where the small police post is located.Kenya has been hit by a series of grenade and gun attacks since it sent troops into Somalia last October in pursuit of Islamist al Shabaab militants whom it blamed for kidnapping its security personnel and Western tourists.(Reporting by Noor Ali-Isiolo; Writing By Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Michael Roddy)	2	2	3	2	2	3	3	2	3	2	2	2	1	3	2	
276	habcam-opens-unique-window-seafloor-life-142613587	The oceans are getting the red-carpet treatment with a new project from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution: HabCam, an optical imaging endeavor that provides researchers with a one-of-a-kind glimpse of the seafloor.The "Cam" part of HabCam is a camera system that is towed over the ocean bottom along the continental shelf (where a continent drops off under the ocean) off the East Coast of the United States. The system snaps six images per second — that's a half-million images per day; then, a process corrects the color and an algorithm stitches the pictures together to create a giant panorama of the seafloor. Each day, HabCam can capture 100 nautical miles (185 kilometers) of ocean floor.Amber York, a biology research associate at Woods Hole who works on HabCam, told OurAmazingPlanet that pictures have already sparked her interest: She has spotted an anemone and a worm that could be new species."As a biologist, I think what excites me more than anything about this project is the ability to see these organisms in a large scale in their natural habitat," York said. "A lot of these off-shore species are not as well-documented as the coastal ones on the beach. It's intense detective work trying to identify them." [HabCam Images: Peek Beneath the Waves]Zigzagging over the seafloorHabCam's 2-megapixel camera is towed on a large metal skeleton by a 103-foot (31 meters) sea scallop trawler, above coastal regions of the Northeast, including Georges Bank, the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. To collect the photos, HabCam is towed from a ship and travels in patterns from zigzags to spirals through the ocean about 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) above the seafloor, collecting more than 40 million images in total. The newest version of the system also includes a side scan acoustics system that gathers information on seafloor roughness — something that is difficult to see with the photos alone.The pictures also give scientists a window into how marine life on the seafloor acts. In the past, biologists have used giant trawlers to scoop up critters and dump them on the deck of ships for analysis. The problem, York said, is that the creatures look different when they come up than they do in their natural habitat."They may change their color as they come up, or they get broken up too much in the process," she said.HabCam also gives a peek into the way the creatures live on the floor. For example, sea stars were thought to be relatively spread out, but York has noticed that they tend to gather in armies — she calls them hordes — and eat everything in their path as they move across a scallop field.Counting scallops and sea starsThe camera is helping scientists count scallops on the seafloor, and helping them understand the health of the ecosystem. Right now, it's being used to count scallops in a way that is much more rigorous than previous methods. They want to create a quantifiable marker for the habitat, including factors such as species richness, diversity, the composition of the material the creatures live on, and ecosystem change through time and over different areas. HabCam will help create an historical baseline for the seafloor health to be evaluated in the future.Of course, it's a lot of work sifting through all those images. To help, those running HabCam have reached out to the Citizen Science Alliance and launched an interactive website called "Seafloor Explorer," where people can help identify scallops, sea stars and other creatures in the pictures. The project is starting with 100,000 images to annotate."We are interested in finding out what is happening to the seafloor over time, but we also need help in identifying individuals in all the photos," York said. The research group is working on a system to train computers to classify the images, but first they need people power to interpret what they're seeing.York is positively pumped over the future of the field."I think this is just the start of a whole field of research — imaging of marine life on the seafloor," she said.	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	1	2	1	4	4

281	history-religious-hoaxes-132526660	The trailer for the film "Innocence of Muslims" recently led to riots over its depiction of the prophet Muhammad as a womanizer, child molester and criminal. Several Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, were killed in protests that have been linked to the film.Despite the outrage it's not clear that the film actually exists; certainly a trailer for it does, but a trailer isn't a film. Investigation into the anti-Muslim "film" is ongoing, but as yet there seems to be no evidence that the film exists other than as a deadly hoax. People create hoaxes for many reasons, but when fraud mixes with religious fervor the results can range from the comical to the deadly.Here's a look at seven religious hoaxes throughout history.1. The Protocols of the Elders of ZionPerhaps the most infamous and malicious religious hoax in history, "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion" is a book supposedly revealing a secret Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. It first appeared in Russia in 1905, and though the book has been completely discredited as a forgery, it is still in print and remains widely circulated.Many people have endorsed this religious hoax, including actor Mel Gibson, Adolf Hitler, and automaker Henry Ford, who in 1920 paid to have a half-million copies of the book published. [Top 10 Conspiracy Theories]2. The Shroud of Turin and Other Holy RelicsThough many believe that Italy's Shroud of Turin is the burial shroud of Jesus, there's compelling evidence the shroud is in fact a hoax, including a 1389 letter from French Bishop Pierre d'Arcisto Pope Clement stating that a painter confessed to creating it. Indeed, the Bishop's evidence was so convincing that even Pope Clement acknowledged it as a forgery — one of countless faked religious relics circulating at the time. Carbon dating of the Shroud of Turin revealed it does not date back to the time of Christ but instead 14 centuries later — exactly when the forger confessed to making it. Even more damning for its authenticity, there is no record of its existence before then; if it really is the burial shroud of Jesus Christ, it seems suspicious that no one knew anything about it for 1,300 years. Though many remain convinced of its authenticity, the historical and scientific evidence suggest the Shroud of Turin is probably a religious hoax. As researcher Joe Nickell noted in his book "Relics of the Christ" (The University Press of Kentucky, 2007),the shroud on display in Turin is only one of over 40 such Jesus shrouds — all claimed to be the real one. [Who Was Jesus, the Man?]3. The Cardiff GiantWhen farm workers digging a well in Cardiff, N.Y., uncovered a fossilized man in 1869 they found something remarkable. The Cardiff Giant, as the figure became known, was a somewhat realistic figure with roughly human dimensions — except that it was nearly 10 feet tall. It was clearly something unique — but what exactly it was divided the public. Some believed it was a stone carving, but who would have made it so long ago that it was buried so deep in the ground? Others, including a local reverend, were convinced it was proof of the literal truth of Biblical scripture, specifically Genesis 6:4 ("There were giants in the earth in those days" KJV). Here, finally, was one of those Biblical giants, discovered on a rural New York farm! It was in fact a clever hoax by a man named George Hull who had planted the carved stone where it would later be found by the farm hands, partly to prove the Bible literalists wrong.4. Indian Guru Sai Baba's LegerdemainOne of the most influential spiritual leaders in India, Satya Sai Baba died last year at the age of 84. For over five decades the charismatic guru enthralled and mystified followers by performing minor miracles, including producing holy ash, watches, statues, necklaces and rings seemingly out of thin air. However, skeptical investigators including Basava Premanand of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations accused Sai Baba of simple magicians' tricks, and pointed out that all the objects were small and easily concealed in his hands and long-sleeved robes. In at least one case Sai Baba was caught on film by British investigator Professor Richard Wiseman secretly pulling small objects from his person while pretending they appeared out of nowhere.5. The Discovery of Noah's ArkThose seeking to find archaeological and historical proof of events in the Bible have often looked for — and, some claim, even found — Noah's Ark. Though many claims of finding the ark are honest mistakes, in 1993 a man hoaxed CBS television into running atwo-hour primetime special titled "The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark." It featured a man named George Jammal, who claimed to have found the ark on a mountain in Turkey. As proof of his incredible claim, he proudly displayed a piece of wood from the ark; it was in fact scrap pine marinated in soy sauce, and Jammal was an actor who had never even been to Turkey.6. The Ossuary of James, Brother of JesusIn 2002 an antiquities dealer in Israel claimed to have discovered a limestone ossuary (used to hold bones of the dead) with an inscription in Aramaic on one side of the box identifying its (missing) contents as those of "James, Son of Joseph, Brother of Jesus." The find made international news because if genuine, it might provide archaeological evidence for Jesus Christ. However many archaeologists were skeptical for several reasons, including that there was no clear provenance (history) for the item and because carved rosette patterns on the other side of the box were rounded from age and decay, while the script on the disputed inscription had sharp edges suggesting it was recently added. A chalk wash also appeared to have been added to the lettering to make it appear older than it actually was. In 2003 the Israeli Antiquities Authority published a report concluding that the inscription was a modern forgery carved on a genuinely old ossuary box. [Faux Real: A Gallery of Forgeries]7. God Speaks to Peter Popoff Via Short-Wave RadioOne of the most prominent televangelists in the 1980s was Peter Popoff, who, during his services and revivals, would call out names and home addresses of audience members he'd never met. He even knew personal details such as family members' illnesses or their deceased loved ones' names. It seemed that Popoff got his messages from God or angels, and it greatly impressed his audiences and followers.In 1986, magician James "The Amazing" Randi heard about Popoff's amazing abilities and decided to investigate. Randi noticed an apparently minor detail that most people missed: Popoff was wearing a hearing aid or earpiece. Using a radio scanner, Randi discovered that Popoff was actually getting biographical information about audience members from his wife (who had earlier spoken to the audience) using a short-wave radio. The scandal tarnished Popoff's ministry, but he eventually recovered and remains active today.Benjamin Radford is deputy editor of Skeptical Inquirer science magazine and author of Scientific Paranormal Investigation: How to Solve Unexplained Mysteries.

282	homeland-modern-family-win-big-emmys-031313968	LOS ANGELES (AP) — "Homeland," which puts the battle against terrorism on American soil, was honored as best drama series at Sunday's Emmys and earned trophies for stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis. "Modern Family" was named best comedy."We feel so lucky, lucky not only to have jobs in these challenging times, but to have jobs that we love with people we love," said Steven Levitan, co-creator of "Modern Family."The drama "Homeland" stopped "Mad Men" in its tracks, denying the show a record-setting fifth trophy and kept Bryan Cranston from his fourth consecutive best drama award for "Breaking Bad" and "Mad Men" star Jon Hamm an also-ran once more.The Emmys refused to play it predictably Sunday, with Jon Cryer of "Two and a Half Men" earning a best actor award and Jimmy Kimmel proving a game but uneven host."I'm one of those pesky Brits, I apologize," said Lewis, who plays an American in the espionage thriller. "I don't really believe in judging art, but I thought I'd show up just in case."Danes, eye-catching in a bright yellow dress that gracefully draped the pregnant actress, was effusive."My husband, my love, my life, my baby daddy, this doesn't mean anything without you," she said to her spouse, actor Hugh Dancy.Backstage, Danes said she particularly appreciated one fan: President Barack Obama has said he's a fan of "Homeland," about a Marine and former POW who's suspected of working for al Qaeda."No pressure," the actress said. "It's way cool that he is a fan. It speaks to the relevancy of the show and it's hugely validating."The acting trophies, along with a best writing award for the show, gave "Homeland" momentum as it headed toward the best drama award.Aaron Paul won best supporting drama actor for "Breaking Bad" and "Homeland" won the best writing award."Thank you so much for not killing me off," Paul said of his drug-dealing character's lucky survival. "Thank you Hollywood for allowing me to be part of your group," he added, noting he'd moved from Idaho to pursue his dreams.On the comedy side, Emmy voters decided that "Two and a Half Men" with Jon Cryer and without Charlie Sheen is really good, as Cryer claimed the best comedy actor trophy."Don't panic, people. Something has clearly gone terribly wrong. I'm stunned," said Cryer, who on the red carpet before the show has expressed confidence he wouldn't win. Among others, he beat out two-time winner Jim Parsons of "The Big Bang Theory."Ashton Kutcher, who joined the show after Sheen was fired, wasn't nominated.Julia Louis-Dreyfus was honored as best actress in comedy for "Veep."Andy Griffith topped a segment honoring industry members who died during the previous year. Ron Howard, who played Griffith's son Opie in "The Andy Griffith Show," said he belonged "in the pantheon.""Dang if he didn't make it look powerful easy while he was going about it," Howard said.Phyllis Diller, Davy Jones of "The Monkees," Sheman Hemsley and Richard Dawson were among the others honored in a montage.Earlier in the show, Kimmel dared to mock the in memorian package that typically airs at awards shows with one showing him in various guises. Josh Groban sang a mournful "You're Beautiful" in background."I will be missed," Kimmel said.Maggie Smith was honored as best supporting drama actress for her tart-tongued dowager in "Downton Abbey," unhurt by the program's move from the miniseries category."Homeland," the domestic espionage thriller, won the best drama writing award."Modern Family" made it look easy as the comedy won the best directing trophy and Eric Stonestreet and Julie Bowen claimed supporting actor awards. There was at least a minor backlash online as some questioned whether the show had a deserving season.Stonestreet was funny and touching as he accepted for his role as half of a devoted gay couple."I wouldn't be standing here without Jesse Tyler Ferguson, there is no Cam without Mitch," he said, saluting his co-star. "We get the awesome opportunity to play these two characters on TV and show America and the world what a loving couple we can be just like everybody else."Then he turned saucy: "I never knew I'd be on TV as a gay man, but I love the pictures of hairy chests you guys are sending me, it's really amazing. Thank you for those."Among reality competitors, "The Amazing Race" was honored as best reality series, ninth time in 10 nominations for the award. Tom Bergeron of "Dancing With the Stars" won as best host of a reality series.Julianne Moore's uncanny take on Gov. Sarah Palin in the TV movie "Game Change," about the 2008 presidential campaign, earned her best actress honors."I feel so validated because Sarah Palin gave me a big thumbs down," Palin said, beaming.Kevin Costner was named best actor for the history-based miniseries "Hatfields & McCoys," while Tom Berenger was named best supporting actor for the project and Jessica Lange won supporting actress honors for "American Horror Story." ''Game Change" was crownd best series."The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" proved unstoppable, winning its 10th consecutive best variety show trophy. Stewart, discussing the lasting value of his show, apparently forgot that what flies on free-wheeling cable gets censored on network television."Years from now when the Earth is just a burning husk and aliens visit, they will find a box of these, and they will know, just how predictable these (several bleeps) can be," he said.Standup comic Louis C.K. won the Emmy for best comedy writing for "Louie" and for the special "Louis C.K. Live at the Beacon Theatre." Said the comedian after his second win: "Thank you to audiences around the country who still go to see live comedy."Kimmel, who played it clean, set up one of the night's best filmed comedy bits by musing on what "Breaking Bad" would have been like had it aired in a G-rated, pre-cable era.The answer: a spoof of the opening to "The Andy Griffith Show," with "Breaking Bad" stars Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, fully suited up to cook crystal meth, out at the lake with their fishing poles as the "Andy Griffith" whistling theme song was heard.As a pungent punchline, they shot dead an unexpected witness: a friendly deputy billed as co-star Don Knotts.The show started with bathroom humor: A filmed bit with Kathy Bates, Zooey Deschanel and other nominated actresses prepping in the restroom, then discovering a weeping Jimmy Kimmel lamenting a Botox reaction he said would keep him off stage as host."You look beautiful," he was reassured. "You look like a 'Real Housewife.'"Viewers of the skit may have been puzzled by a nude Lena Dunham, the creator-star of "Girls," who's routinely brave about showing skin on the HBO comedy.Not all his material worked. One bit that fell flat had Kimmel's parents, or so the host said, escorted out of the theater because they promised he would win an Emmy and he didn't."Family Guy" creator Seth MacFarlane found presenting can be tricky."Oh, the mic's over there," he said, after discovering he was on the wrong side of the stage. "This is what happens when you don't come to rehearsal," MacFarlane said.Fashionistas noticed yellow was hot, the color of choice for Julianne Moore, a pregnant Danes, Julie Bowen and Hannah Simone from "New Girl.""Best hair and makeup goes to Danes. Perfect!" tweeted Emma Roberts.HBO came into the night with a leading 17 creative arts Emmys from a Sept. 15 ceremony honoring technical and other achievements. CBS was second with 13, followed by PBS with 11. Discovery received six awards, NBC got five and ABC and the Cartoon Network won four each. Fox received two trophies.Emmy has to prove herself a winner with the audience. After rebounding somewhat to 13.5 million viewers in 2010 after an all-time low in 2008 of 12.3 million, last year's show drew 12.4 million viewers airing on Fox. The ceremony rotates annually among the four major networks.___Television Writer Frazier Moore in New York and AP Writer Beth Harris in Los Angeles contributed to this report.	4	3	3	4	4	4	2	3	2	2	4	2	2	1	3	4

285	hpv-vaccine-found-safe-large-study-202655315	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A study of nearly 190,000 young women injected with Merck & Co's human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil found no new safety concerns.Researchers said the only side effects they observed - rare cases of skin infections and fainting - were benign and expected."This analysis was very reassuring," said lead researcher Dr. Nicola Klein of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland, California, whose work was funded by Merck.HPV vaccination is recommended for both boys and girls to shield them from the sexually transmitted infection, which may cause various types of cancer.While Gardasil has already been deemed safe and effective by health regulators across the globe, large follow-up studies are typically required after vaccines hit the market to make sure less-common side effects haven't been missed.Klein's team studied girls and women ages 9 to 26 who had had at least one Gardasil shot between 2006 and 2008. Based on electronic records, they compared ER visits and hospitalizations soon after vaccination and several months later, when short-term side effects would no longer be expected to show up.Three doses of Gardasil, the recommended amount, cost about $360. U.S. health regulators have found no serious side effects apart from soreness at the injection site.At first glance, several health conditions appeared to be linked to the vaccination, including seizures, allergic reactions and birth defects in vaccine recipients.A special safety committee without ties to Merck concluded that most of these conditions were not truly caused by the vaccine, however, but rather unrelated or preexisting conditions detected when the shot was given."All of a sudden these things get brought up again," said Klein, "but it has absolutely nothing to do with the vaccination."After reviewing medical records for a number of different conditions that might be linked to the vaccine, the researchers determined that only two of them were legitimate findings.In the two weeks after getting the vaccine, there were 1.8 cases of skin infections per 10,000 women, compared to just one case per two weeks per 10,000 women months away from the vaccination.And some of those "infections" might simply have been red swellings at the injection site, said Klein, whose findings are published in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine.A STRESS REACTION?On the day of the vaccination, the rate of fainting was six times higher than usual. But again, the risk was very low and has been seen before in other vaccine studies, Klein said.It's possible that fainting may be a stress reaction to the injection itself, according to Dr. Michael Brady, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.He said adolescents should sit down for 15 minutes after getting a shot, as also advised by health officials."If they do fall and hit their head it can have consequences, so it's not something to be ignored," added Brady, who was not involved in the new work and has no ties to HPV vaccine makers.Overall, he said the study didn't bring up any unexpected concerns."The combination of a vaccine that is working and is safe should make people feel comfortable," Brady added.Gardasil is expected to prevent more than 90 percent of genital warts and between 60 and 70 percent of cervical cancers, according to Dr. Christopher Harrison of Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City, Missouri."The risk benefit here is clearly and resoundingly in favor of the vaccine being much more beneficial than risky," said Harrison, who was not linked to the new study and has not had any relationship to Merck for the past three years.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/SYxece Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, online October 1, 2012.	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	1	1	3	4

The cargo ship's undocking occurred at 5:44 p.m. EDT (2144 GMT).The space departure occurred three days later than planned due to delays, first by a computer glitch and later by space junk near the space station.But Friday, the ATV-3 spacecraft, which is named the Edoardo Almadi after the famed late Italian physicist of the same name, made a flawless departure from the station. It will spend the next few days orbiting Earth before being intentionally destroyed on Tuesday (Oct. 3) by burning up in Earth's atmosphereover the Pacific Ocean. [Photos: Europe's Robotic ATV Spaceships]"Today, everything has worked to perfection," NASA spokesman Rob Navias said during the agency's live broadcast of the undocking.The ATV-3 spacecraft was built by the European Space Agency and delivered 7.2 tons of food, water and other vital supplies to astronauts aboard the International Space Station when it launched in March from a South American spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. The ATV-3 spent 184 linked to the space station before being packed with trash and other unneeded items for its eventual fiery demise in Earth's atmosphere.The ATV-3 is ESA's third unmanned cargo ship mission to visit the space station, which is also supplied by robotic cargo ships from Japan and Russia. In the United States, NASA has contracted two companies — SpaceX of Hawthorne, Calif., and Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp. — to provide unmanned cargo delivery flights to the station. The first official flight by SpaceX is scheduled to launch on Oct. 7, when the companyThe ATV craft are huge cylinders 32 feet long (10 meters) and nearly 15 feet wide (4.5 m) and may be visible by observers on Earth as a bright moving light in the night sky, weather permitting.

288	human-finger-idaho-trout-belongs-wakeboarder-213629550	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — A human finger found inside a fish at Idaho's Priest Lake has been traced to a wakeboarder who lost four fingers in an accident more than two months earlier.Fisherman Nolan Calvin found the finger while he was cleaning the trout in early September. He put it on ice and called the Bonner County, Idaho, sheriff's office.The Spokesman-Review newspaper reports that detectives were able to get a fingerprint off the severed digit. They matched it to a fingerprint card for a 31-year-old man.Investigators learned that the man, Hans A. Galassi, lost four fingers from his left hand in a July 4 accident on the same lake where the fish was caught.The three other fingers have not been recovered.	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	1	2	3	4
289	human-rights-activist-arrested-algerian-police-214741851	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — A member of a leading human rights organization has been beaten and arrested in a southern Algerian city.The lawyer for Yacine Zaid said Tuesday that his client had been punched and beaten by police when they arrested him at a road block in Ouargla , 700 kilometers (435 miles) south of the capital. The lawyer, Sidhoum Mohamed Amine, said Zaid was arrested Monday on the ground that he had shown a lack of respect for police.The daily El Watan reported that Zaid would go on trial Monday for "humiliating" and "striking a police officer." The paper quoted an eyewitness, Abdelmalek Aibek Eg Sahli, a representative of a hotel union, as saying that Zaid "wasn't aggressive and I don't see why he is accused of that."Amine said in an interview with The Associated Press that police often use "verbal aggression" to justify an arrest.Zaid, a well-known blogger, is a member of the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights. He was detained in Algiers on Sept. 25 after a support rally for another human rights militant on a hunger strike, but later released.	3	2	3	2	2	4	3	2	3	2	2	2	1	4	2	4
290	human-rights-court-rejects-extradition-appeal-uk-islamist-185154021	PARIS (Reuters) - The European Court of Human Rights on Monday gave final approval for one of Britain's most radical Islamist clerics, Abu Hamza al-Masri, to be extradited to the United States with four others to be tried for terrorism.The Egyptian-born cleric filed an appeal, along with the four other suspects, after the court in Strasbourg authorized Britain to transfer him to the United States on charges that he supported al Qaeda and aided a fatal kidnapping in Yemen.Al-Masri, 54, could face a sentence of over 100 years in an ultra-secure "Supermax" prison, and had argued that such treatment would contravene Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhumane and degrading treatment."Today the Grand Chamber decided to reject the request. This means that the Chamber judgment of April 10, 2012, is now final," the ECHR said in a statement.The decision also concerned appeals lodged by four other defendants, Babar Ahmad, Syed Tahla Ahsan, Adel Abdul Bary and Khaled Al-Fawwaz, all of whom have been detained in Britain pending extradition to the United States.A spokesperson for Britain's Home Office welcomed the outcome, adding that Britain would work to ensure that all five individuals were handed over to U.S. authorities as quickly as possible.Al-Masri is one of the most radical Islamists in Britain, where he was once a preacher at a North London mosque but was later convicted of inciting murder and racial hatred. He is being held in a British jail.He was indicted in 2004 by a federal grand jury in New York, accused of providing material support to al Qaeda and of involvement in a hostage taking in Yemen in 1998 in which four hostages were killed.

291	humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518	It really happened: Six generations of inbreeding spanning the years 1800 to 1960 caused an isolated population of humans living in the hills of Kentucky to become blue-skinned.The startlingly blue people, all descendants of a French immigrant named Martin Fugate and still living near his original settlement on the banks of Troublesome Creek when hematologists studied them in the 1960s, turned out to have a rare blood condition called methemoglobinemia. A recessive gene was pairing with itself to change the molecular composition of their blood, making it brown as opposed to red, which tinted their skin blue.The hematologists' attempt to trace the history of the mutant gene revealed a gnarly Fugate family tree, contorted by many an intermarriage between first cousins, aunts and nephews, and the like over the generations. Dennis Stacy, whose great-great-grandfather on both his mother's and father's sides was the same person — Henley Fugate — offered a simple explanation for the rampant interbreeding: In the old days in eastern Kentucky, Stacy said, "There was no roads."It sounds sordid at worst and lazy at best, but in fact, the Fugates' tale is a miniature version of the story of human coupling since time immemorial. Local populations interbreed, causing a sharing of genes, a resulting in-group physical resemblance and, eventually, identification as a distinct race or ethnic group.According to Stephen Stearns, a Yale professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, before the invention of the bicycle, the average distance between the birthplaces of spouses in England was 1 mile (1.6 kilometers). During the latter half of the 19th century, bikes upped the distance men went courting to 30 miles (48 km), on average. Scholars have identified similar patterns in other European countries. Widespread use of bicycles stimulated the grading and paving of roads, lending credence to the Fugate clan's excuse and making way for the introduction of automobiles. Love's horizons have kept expanding ever since."The distance between the birthplaces of parents has continued to increase since the invention of the bicycle, making it now easy, if not standard, for parents to have been born on different continents," Stearns told Life's Little Mysteries.Stearns says globalization, immigration, cultural diffusion and the ease of modern travel will gradually homogenize the human population, averaging out more and more people's traits. Because recessive traits depend on two copies of the same gene pairing up in order to get expressed, these traits will express themselves more rarely, and dominant traits will become the norm. In short, blue skin is out. Brown skin is in.Already in the United States, another recessive trait, blue eyes, has grown far less common. A 2002 study by the epidemiologists Mark Grant and Diane Lauderdale found that only 1 in 6 non-Hispanic white Americans has blue eyes, down from more than half of the U.S. white population being blue-eyed just 100 years ago. [One Common Ancestor Behind Blue Eyes]"The only explanation for the observed pattern that was consistent with the data (that we could think of) was that assortative mating had changed," Lauderdale told Life's Little Mysteries. Assortative mating is the tendency of people to mate with members of their same ancestral group — a tendency that has seemingly lessened over time. "This was consistent with a birth year-related increase in the proportions of individuals who listed more than one ancestry in the 1980 census."Lauderdale says blue eyes won't die out completely; they'll simply stabilize at a low level that reflects the chance of mating between two individuals possessing recessive blue-eye genes.Other recessive traits will drop to low levels too, according to University of Delaware evolutionary biologist John McDonald. "Because most immigrants to the U.S. are from Asia, Africa or Latin America, any trait that is more common in northern Europeans than in the rest of the world will get less common over the near future in the U.S. due to immigration," McDonald wrote in an email. "Examples would include red and blond hair, blue eyes, and freckles. Traits that are recessive and are more common in some groups than others will decrease due to blending; blue eyes, sickle cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis are examples of this."Meanwhile, many other physical traits will simply blend together. "Most of the traits that we think of as distinguishing different groups (hair color, skin color, hair curliness, facial features, eye shape) are controlled by multiple genes, so they don't follow a simple dominant/recessive pattern," McDonald explained. "In those cases, blending will make people look more similar over time."It's not straightforward to predict how blending of genes affects physical appearances, but McDonald said the tendency is for such traits to average out. The average American skin and hair color will probably darken slightly, and there will be fewer people with very dark or very pale skin and hair.The genetic mixing under way in the United States is also happening to a greater or lesser degree in other parts of the world, the researchers said. In some places, unique physical traits tailored to the habitat still confer an evolutionary advantage and thus might not bow out so easily; in other places, immigration happens much more slowly than it does elsewhere. According to Stearns, perfect homogenization of the human race will probably never occur, but in general, Earth is becoming more and more of a melting pot.A population forged from the long-term mixing of Africans, Native Americans and Europeans serves as an archetype for the future of humanity, Stearns said: A few centuries from now, we're all going to look like Brazilians.Follow Natalie Wolchover on Twitter @nattyover or Life's Little Mysteries @llmysteries.

292	humble-business-card-gets-superpowers-nfc-exclusive-083146024	Apple may have skipped near-field communication in the iPhone 5, but that hasn't stopped everyone else from getting on board the NFC train. The latest passenger: Moo.com, which just started experimenting with NFC business cards, with a planned rollout in 2013.[More from Mashable: Should You Wait for the iPhone 5?]You may remember Moo as the folks who brought us Facebook business cards earlier this year. Now they're giving the whole experience of exchanging contact information a needed upgrade with short-range NFC tech.It works like this: You order NFC cards from Moo, specifying what you want the NFC tag to do. It could just contain contact information, but it can also include actions like presenting a video, or an app download, or your latest tweets. When you hand someone your card, and they tap it with an NFC-enabled smartphone, the preprogrammed magic happens. (Check out an explainer video below.)[More from Mashable: Apple May Not Include NFC in the iPhone 5 [VIDEO]]The process isn't without its limitations. First, obviously the person will need an NFC phone. While many popular Android phones have it (and so do the coming crop of Windows Phones, if anyone cares), Apple is out.Second, the cards will likely be a lot more expensive than conventional cards. Moo hasn't revealed pricing, but it's telling that they're only giving current customers who place a business card order a single NFC card. Moo calls it an "open beta test," and the NFC chip will include an electronic version of the card's contact info.However, the cards come with a big bonus, too: Customers will be able to reprogram the NFC chip within to customize cards for various customers. A global manager might want to change the material presented depending on what part of the world he's in, or, if you have the cards for a while, you'll probably want to change the projects you present to new clients. Or you could just have fun with it and show a different random YouTube video on each card.While the cost is still a question mark -- a big one -- we like the idea of flashing custom content to people with our cards. Of course, we stopped the silly practice of writing down phone numbers and emails years ago with the dawn of apps like CardMunch. NFC is progress, as long as the price stays under control.What do you think? Is NFC a welcome upgrade to business cards?

293	hundreds-protest-anti-islam-film-nigeria-121502291	KADUNA, Nigeria (AP) — Hundreds of Muslims march peacefully through the streets of a northern Nigerian city to protest an anti-Islam film that denigrates the Prophet Muhammad.The march took place Monday in the city of Kaduna, where hundreds were killed in religious violence following Nigeria's 2011 presidential election. Those protesting left behind graffiti on walls reading: "Death to the Americans, Death to the Israelites."The protest comes after a series of protests have taken place in Nigeria, a nation largely split between a Christian south and a Muslim north. All the demonstrations have been peaceful, though one protest was broken up by soldiers firing into the air.The film, "Innocence of Muslims," has sparked protests around the world. American leaders have denounced the film, which is protected under U.S. free speech laws.	2	2	3	3	3	1	1	2	2	1	2	1	1	2	2	4
294	idaho-woman-charged-stick-figure-threat-215449146	BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A woman who was about to be released from an Idaho prison will stay behind bars a while longer because federal prosecutors say she mailed a threatening stick figure drawing to a relative.Linda Joyce Lakes was serving time at the Pocatello Women's Correctional Center on probation violations stemming from a 2007 grand theft sentence, and she was scheduled to be released last Friday. But earlier this month, the U.S. attorney's office charged her with mailing threatening communications, a felony.Prosecutors say that in 2010, Lakes mailed a drawing that apparently depicted a battered stick figure alongside threatening phrases such as "No tears," ''No hiding," and "No more you."Kyle Wright, an FBI agent in Pocatello who investigated the case, described the drawing in a court document."One stick figure appeared to be lying down with his face smashed. The baseball bat was lying nearby with damage that appeared to be consistent with its use on the first stick figure. The second stick figure appeared to be walking away with a smile," Wright wrote.Wright also said in his affidavit that Lakes sent a letter with the drawing that indicated her prison sentence was coming to an end and that the recipient should be prepared for his final moments.The FBI agent also said that Lakes told the FBI her drawing symbolized her hate for a man who had abused her in the past, and that one day she wanted to beat and possibly kill him.Lakes was released from the state prison and taken into federal custody. She waived her preliminary hearing on the charge and has not yet entered a plea.Lisa Tolle, a paralegal with Federal Defender Services of Idaho in Pocatello, said her office had just been assigned the case and attorneys had not yet fully reviewed it.	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	1	1	1	2	4
295	implant-scandal-sparks-revamp-eu-medical-device-rules-112216920	BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has proposed tougher rules on assessing the safety and monitoring the use of medical devices and implants, after weak EU regulations were partly blamed for a global scandal over French-made breast implants.Investigations last year showed that hundreds of thousands of women around the world had been implanted with substandard silicone implants made by defunct French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP), which safety regulators had failed to stop for more than a decade.The scandal prompted calls for Europe to toughen its controls on medical devices, which are currently overseen by an ad hoc network of up to 80 national assessment agencies, most of which are private companies."Just a few months ago, everybody was shocked by the scandal involving fraudulent breast implants which affected tens of thousands of women in Europe and around the world," EU health commissioner John Dalli said in a statement on Wednesday to outline the draft rules.The proposals take into account lessons from the PIP implant scandal, and will significantly tighten the authorization process for medical devices before they are put on the market, the European Commission said.Among the main changes will be an extension of the current legal definition of medical devices to include breast and other aesthetic implants.Independent assessment agencies will be given greater powers to monitor device manufacturers, including unannounced factory inspections and regular product testing, while EU governments will be obliged to improve their supervision of the agencies."If this was happening in the market, the PIP scandal would have been detected many years before and eliminated," Dalli told a news conference.Better product traceability systems will also be introduced so that people can be alerted more rapidly to safety concerns surrounding a particular device.The European market for medical devices was estimated at 95 billion euros ($123 billion) in 2009, with products ranging from sticking plasters to high-tech miniature diagnostic implants and life support machines.Major manufacturers of medical devices include Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Abbott Laboratories, Allergan and Smith & Nephew.The legislation must be jointly approved by EU governments and lawmakers, which could take up to two years.

297	individual-shows-boldly-stamp-paris-fashion-week-194057909	PARIS (AP) — Coco Chanel once said: "The most courageous act is still to think for yourself."Day five of Paris Fashion Week did not lose sight of the legendary fashion designer's words.Saturday presented a gold mine of eclectic and individual shows, each with a unique stamp of their designer.London-based Vivienne Westwood led the crowd, celebrating Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee, but travelling — as she did — via Japan, Russia, Spain and Africa.Westwood is the only designer on the Paris fashion calendar — or perhaps anywhere — who can cross the globe and several centuries, mixing up Bangkok-style catwomen, Chinese tea prints, tropical cowboys, Velasquez peasants, the Ballets Russes, and still produce a coherent and unified show.Viktor & Rolf, meanwhile, went back to their signature plays on oversized proportion to produce a glitzy show — as they prepare to celebrate 20 years since they founded the label.The epitome of femininity, Cacharel, explored spring through the natural colors of mother nature, in a trademark delicate display.Sunday's shows include Kenzo, Celine and Hermes.___VIVIENNE WESTWOOD"Global exotic," is how English designer Vivienne Westwood described her brilliant and wacky spring-summer 2013 show, hosted on terra mater in Paris' British Embassy.Disparate encyclopedia fashion references amazingly gelled together, owing to her unique eccentricity.Westwood cited Sergei Diaghilev's "Ballets Russes" — the early 20th century's most famous ballet company — as a key inspiration.The influential troupe used exotic styles with billowing trousers and turbans — which was evoked in many of the baggy globe-trotting looks.One of the nicest looks came in a series of modified Japanese kimonos.One in light gray silk, with wide bateau collar, had fluttering hoop panels that fluttered by.Above all else, Westwood — who's 71 — has lost none of her humor.There was a special guest star — a model portraying Queen Elizabeth II. She clutched a handbag in a crown and demure gray silk dress. In this cameo, unlike in the Olympic Games opening ceremony in which a queen look-a-like parachuted into the main stadium, the model just walked in through the embassy door.___VIKTOR & ROLFViktor & Rolf were feeling reflective, looking back on almost two decades since founding their fashion house, and that was evident Saturday in their oversized spring-summer ode to 70s pleated glamor."We were in a reflective mood..." said Viktor Horsting, one half of the famed Dutch design duo which is approaching its 20th anniversary.Not ones to normally take things quite so literally, the inseparable Viktor and Rolf channeled mirrors in their oversized spring-summer ode to 70's pleated glamor.The designers, who founded their Amsterdam-based fashion house in 1993, sent models through a reflective tunnel onto a catwalk wearing mainly black, white and silver ensembles that featured blinding mirror appliques on sumptuous silks.Oversized proportion — a signature mark — produced some hits.Giant bows in soft pink and purple were used high or low on the waist to sumptuous effect.But there were some small misses in proportion, too: One tubular floor-length skirt had rose-shaped mirror appliques whose size competed with the model's head.___CACHARELCacharel perfectly captured the fresh mood of spring, in a feminine collection — typical of the popular French house — that brought aquatic life to the catwalk.Free hanging A-line slip dress and gently flaring peplums and skirts Saturday, floated alongside prints of goldfish skin, anemones and underwater tea flower bloom.This spring-summer 2013 collection was also a celebration of the natural world in its careful palette the Cerulean blue of sky, orange of sea coral and tea green.But perhaps nature is in the house DNA: After all, designer Jean Bousquet who founded the house in 1962, named it after a small, beautifully striped dabbling duck with the same name.Today's designers Ling Liu and Dawei Sun keep these codes, therefore, adding this season a touch of contemporary graphic prints.The gentle blurring made this collection a visual treat.___MARTIN GRANTAustralian Martin Grant is not a household name, but he has a solid reputation in the fashion world and a string of celebrity followers like Juliette Binoche, Kate Hudson and Cate Blanchett.Saturday's clean and on-trend collection proves it's little wonder."I wanted to play with volumes," Grant said backstage, referring to the many looks which had elongated peplums and jacket-skirts, twinned with black shorts — seen in Raf Simons' show for Dior.Black and navy was used well in A-line with trapeze silhouettes, and accentuated midriff — one of the big parts of this season's fashion conversation — nicely nipped the silhouettes.One of the colors of the season, vermilion, was used perfectly as shards of color, or completely covering dresses.___Thomas Adamson can be followed at http:/ /Twitter.com/ThomasAdamsonAP	3	3	3	3	4	3	1	4	3	3	3	4	4	1	3	3
298	indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance	JAKARTA (Reuters) - One evening in late September, Peter Wesser and his club of veteran minerals explorers met at Jakarta's Hotel Kristal to swap stories and exchange news. Beer and roast beef were on the menu - on the agenda was trying to figure out how to stay in business.For decades explorers have enjoyed a place on the cutting edge of the country's mining boom as they scoured the earth for fresh mineral deposits, a process that can take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars before payback.But now they complain that new rules aimed at boosting state revenue from natural resources have slashed investment in mineral prospecting and could threaten the entire $93 billion sector."Exploration is by nature optimistic," said Wesser, 73, an Indonesian, born to Dutch parents, with decades of mining experience. "The government doesn't understand the importance of exploration ... Mining without exploration is an industry that goes downhill."The explorers are not the only ones struggling with the impact of the regulations that have caused industry-wide uncertainty in Indonesia, compounding the effects of a global commodities downturn.Small miners in particular have been hit, leading to mine closures and lay-offs in regions such as Sulawesi island, with some resorting to bribing central government officials to continue to export, according to interviews with four mining executives.An analysis of official data shows the rules have also caused a slump in exports of ore, leading key buyer China to seek supplies from elsewhere.The government of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is reforming the minerals sector in a plan to propel the G20 country into a global top-10 economy by 2025.Mining already contributes 12 percent to GDP, and Indonesia is a world leader in nickel ore, thermal coal and refined tin exports, while bauxite exports have spiked in recent years."If we do not begin the efforts to increase mining added value, we will be economically colonized forever," said Deputy Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Rudi Rubiandini.The regulations restrict the export of raw ores, force foreign miners to divest over half their assets after 10 years of production and require domestic processing of ore by 2014.SURGE THEN PLUNGEThe most dramatic effect of the new rules has been on mineral exports, which surged as companies fought to beat a May 6 export tax deadline and plunged thereafter.In August Chinese imports of nickel ore from Indonesia dropped 39 percent to 1.48 million tonnes, following steep falls in July and June, Chinese data shows. China's imports from the Philippines nearly doubled over the same period.Nowhere is the human impact of the slide more visible than in the remote mining communities of Sulawesi, an island east of Borneo and the country's main source of nickel.Prior to the regulations coming into force in May up to a dozen ships could be seen standing off the port of Kolaka, waiting to collect nickel ore as fleets of trucks scooped mud from nearby hills and transported it down to the docks.Now the rudimentary ports stand idle and only security guards patrol the abandoned piles of mud. Workers in Sulawesi said the situation for miners was worse now than in 2009 when the global financial crisis hit commodity exports worldwide.The plight of Rasiun, a father-of-three, illustrates the impact on miners. The former fisherman and farmer sold his land to miner Prima Nusa Sentosa, who offered him $5 a day to pull tarpaulins over ore to protect it from rain.When the mine closed because of the new regulations he lost his job, but mining pollution has stained the sea red and made it impossible to go back to fishing."We thought we could change our fate with the company. Our land is now owned by the company and run-off from the company has flowed into the sea, so now we are unemployed," he said, adding he was "half-dead" with worry over how he would feed his family.WORLD-CLASS DISCOVERIESThousands of firms are affected by the laws and there is a backlog at the mining ministry in Jakarta as many seek the license, quota and recommendations needed to resume exports.To cut red tape it helps to pay the ministry between $500,000 and $1.5 million, said a senior mining executive, who declined to be identified. Three other executives at different mining firms also said bribes were required."Miners have to get a recommendation from the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry. What does the word 'recommendation' mean here? You can work that out by yourself," said Juanforti Silalahi, a spokesman for miners' union Spartan.The mining ministry denies there is corruption in the permit process.The new regulations do not apply to miners who hold older Contracts of Work (CoW), including some of the most prominent industry names such as the Indonesian units of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc , Newmont Mining Corp and Vale .They also do not apply to coal producers, although for both groups the rules have caused unease that the government's regulatory drive will extend to them through higher royalties.It is not clear whether the export slump, which coincides with a general downturn that has lopped about a quarter off iron ore and thermal coal prices this year and halted major mining investments in Australia, is a blip or part of a realignment that will hurt mining for a generation.As they ate and drank at the Jakarta hotel, the members of the Forum for Exploration and Mineral Development were pessimistic about their business, which is crucial for long-term industry growth.Wesser's last firm, Oxindo, a copper explorer owned by Chinese mining group MMG <1208.HK>, closed its Jakarta office in September, one of five members of the group to quit since May."There will be no more world-class discoveries in Indonesia," said forum head Malcolm Baillie, about a country that is home to a mine with the world's biggest gold reserves.(Additional reporting by Michael Taylor and Yayat Supriatna in Jakarta and Sonali Paul in Melbourne; Writing by Matthew Bigg; Editing by Alex Richardson)	3	3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	1	3	3	4

The small LCD screen will include video of the stars of the show and then a live feed from @CW_Network. The feed will include the six latest tweets on the account, though an in-house media team at the CW will screen out any objectionable content, according to The New York Times. However, Rick Haskins, CW’s EVP for marketing and digital projects, told The Times that the network won't delete negative comments about the shows. “To me that’s what starts the dialogue,” he said.EW broke new ground three years ago in what was likely the first video insert in a major magazine -- a Pepsi ad that ran in 50,000 copies of the publication in New York and Los Angeles. Other magazines have since followed suit, including most recently, the UK version of Marie Claire.The push comes as networks are eyeing Twitter as a prime vehicle to introduce new shows and engage fans with existing ones. For instance, Fox this week scored another first by premiering Raising Hope exclusively on Twitter.The Mashable Media Summit 2012 will explore the impact that technology is having on media, and how digital media is affecting our lives and changing the world.

300	inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616	PRESIDENT OBAMA SUMMONED the top four congressional leaders to the White House on Saturday morning, July 23, 2011. The night before, House Speaker John A. Boehner had withdrawn from negotiations to raise the $14 trillion federal debt limit and save the government from a catastrophic default. "Nobody wanted to be there," Boehner later recalled. "The president's still pissed."They had about 10 days left before the government would run out of money. Given the global importance of U.S. Treasury securities, failing to extend the debt limit could trigger a worldwide economic meltdown.Boehner said he believed that he and the others — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi — had a plan. He told Obama: We think we can work this out. Give us a little more time. We'll come back to you. We are not going to negotiate this with you.Obama objected, saying that he couldn't be left out of the process. "I've got to sign this bill."Reid, the most powerful Democrat on Capitol Hill, spoke up. The congressional leaders want to speak privately, he said. Give us some time.This was it. Congress was taking over. The leaders were asking the president to leave the meeting he had called.Before the meeting, without telling Obama, the four leaders had tentatively agreed on the framework of a deal. The congressional plan guaranteed that the debt limit would have to be revisited during the 2012 presidential campaign, and Obama was insisting that any agreement would have to take the country through the election.Around 10 p.m., Obama called Boehner, who was at dinner with friends. I am not going to sign a bill that requires me to deal with the debt ceiling a second time before the election, the president told him. He was furious."Listen," Boehner said he told Obama. "I understand it....But you're not going to have a choice. We've got an agreement."Obama again said he would veto such a bill.We're too close to default to reopen the talks, Boehner said. Congress is going to move forward on its own.The president told his senior staff that the call with Boehner had led nowhere. "So we've got to figure out Plan B. Which is, how do we get out of this thing?" he said.The problem was that they did not have a Plan B.IT WAS INCREASINGLY clear that no one was running Washington. That was trouble for everyone, but especially for Obama. Although running things is a joint venture between the president and Congress, a president has to dominate Congress — or at least be seen as dominating Congress. The last president to fold was George H.W. Bush, who gave in to Democrats' demands that income taxes be raised in a 1990 budget deal. And Bush had been a one-term president.Obama sent word that he wanted the two Democratic leaders at the White House at 6 p.m. that Sunday, July 24. No reason was given.Reid arrived in the Oval Office with his chief of staff, David Krone."Harry," the president began, "I hear you have kind of an outline, a framework of something."Reid began to lay out the two-step, $2.7 trillion debt limit extension, then stopped. He was not a details guy. "Well, let David just tell you what it is," he said.It was highly unusual for someone to pass the ball so completely to a staffer. The 44-year-old Krone outlined the plan, including a secret Republican pledge to count $1 trillion in savings from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan toward deficit reduction. That was surprising. Earlier, Boehner had not been willing to accept this accounting gimmick."I don't trust these guys," the president said dismissively. Krone either would not or could not conceal his anger. "Wait a second," Obama said, interrupting someone else who was about to speak. "I can tell David has something else to say.""Mr. President, I am sorry — with all due respect — that we are in this situation that we're in, but we got handed this football on Friday night. And I didn't create this situation. The first thing that baffles me is, from my private-sector experience, the first rule that I've always been taught is to have a Plan B. And it is really disheartening that you, that this White House did not have a Plan B."Several jaws dropped as the Hill staffer blasted the president to his face."So I don't have a lot of options, in the past 36, 48 hours, to put together," Krone continued. "We're supposed to be the ones that fend off an economic catastrophe. And what we find ourselves is now, with no deal, we're going to have to root for the worst possible things to happen in order to prove to the Republicans that you cannot be so callous and let the debt limit expire."That is a horrible position that we're in," Krone said. "And so this may not be the perfect deal, but it's the only deal that we have on the table right now in the situation that we find ourselves."Obama replied: "I understand what you think you're doing. I'm not doing that. The one thing that we need to bring stability to this economy is not throwing the debt limit increase back into the political arena. I'm not doing that under any circumstances. So if that means that I'm not signing this bill, I'm not signing the bill."After the meeting, Obama made a beeline for Krone. The others stepped back so the two could talk, but they still overheard the president's words."I'm sorry," Obama said, putting an arm around Krone's shoulder. "You didn't deserve that. I know how hard you're working, and I know we wouldn't even have a chance without you."Reid gave Krone a ride back to the Capitol. The majority leader was almost like a father to him. "You stood up to him," Reid said. "He needed to hear it, and nobody was telling him."Asked later about the meeting with Reid and Krone, Obama said, "What I said to them is, essentially, any short-term deal is not going to be acceptable. We can go back to the drawing board, but we're running out of time. They need to understand we're not going to do a short-term deal."After more pressure from Obama, Reid split from the other congressional leaders. Later that night, he released a $2.7 trillion deficit reduction plan with a single-step debt limit increase that would last through 2012.Five days later, on Friday, July 29, by a narrow margin of 218 to 210, the House passed Boehner's version of the proposal. It included the two-step procedure that the president adamantly opposed.IN THE WHITE House at 10 later that night, Obama's key advisers discussed the House vote in the office of William Daley, the White House chief of staff. There was a chance the Senate Democrats would fold, because the fastest solution would be to pass the House bill and get out of town for their summer recess. If the bill managed to gain Senate approval, would the president really veto it?"You can't veto," Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told the group. "You cannot be responsible for default." Anything had to be done to prevent it. Anything to preserve the global economy."If he caves," said David Plouffe, Obama's senior political adviser, "it will have long-lasting political repercussions that we may never get out of. If we draw a line in the sand on something this important and cross it, we may never be able to come back."Geithner had to deal with the possibility that the House bill could reach Obama's desk. "My recommendation to the president would be, we've got to sign this. If that's what they offer us, we sign it."Obama appeared unexpectedly at the door. "What's going on? What are you guys talking about?"He knew, of course. They quickly recapped.Could I actually veto it? Obama asked, adopting his law professor manner. What would happen on the day of the veto? The day after?"It would have massive effects," Geithner said. Treasury had to conduct a bond auction in the open market in about five days, the regular Tuesday auction, with settlement on Thursday. That first auction could be a kind of tripwire, setting off a chain reaction. The federal government couldn't pay its bills. "Why would anyone buy U.S. bonds if it's an open question whether we are going to have the authority to pay for them?"Another possible outcome, Geithner said, was perhaps worse. "Suppose we have an auction and no one shows up?"The cascading impact would be unknowable. The world could decide to dump U.S. Treasuries. Prices would plummet, interest rates would skyrocket. The one pillar of stability, the United States, the rock in the global economy, could collapse."So," the president said, "if we give $1.2 trillion now in spending cuts" — the amount in the House bill to get the first increase in the debt ceiling for about six to nine months — "what happens next time?" The Republicans would then come back next year, in the middle of the presidential campaign, and impose more conditions on the next debt ceiling increase. He could not give the Republicans that kind of weapon. It was hostage taking. It was blackmail.So, Obama said, they had to break the Republicans on this. Otherwise, they would be back whenever it suited them politically.They were out of options, Geithner said. The only one might be accepting the House bill, loathsome as it might be. "The 2008 financial crisis will be seen as a minor blip if we default," he said.The president said, "The Republicans are forcing the risk of a default on us. I can't stop them from doing that. We can have the fight now, or we can have the fight later on, but the fight is coming to us."So, no, Obama said, he was not going to cave. Period. He said good night, got up, and left. He was very agitated.Geithner thought there was one other consideration. He did not mention it to anyone, not even the president, but he had thought about it a great deal. It was not just that Obama faced an economic choice or a political choice. He faced a moral choice.The president should not put himself in the position of saying unequivocally that he would veto, Geithner concluded, for one simple reason: No one could be sure how to put the American or the global economy back together again. The impact would be calamitous.Obama n ever had to confront the veto question. A few days later, House Republicans dropped their insistence on the two-step plan. The final plan accepted a debt limit increase that would take the country through the 2012 presidential contest. It also postponed $2.4 trillion in spending cuts until early 2013.The long-term deficit crisis had not been solved, but merely put off, leaving the United States at the edge of the fiscal cliff, where it remains today.From The Price of Politics by Bob Woodward. ©2012 by Bob Woodward.

301	insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business	NEW DELHI (Reuters) - It had been a brutal August for India's Congress party: economic growth was wilting, the monsoon rains were failing and the opposition had it cornered on yet another corruption scandal.In stepped Sonia Gandhi to revive the morale of the ruling party's lawmakers, exhorting them at a meeting to "stand up and fight, fight with a sense of purpose and fight aggressively". It was a stunningly assertive speech from the normally temperate matriarch of a dynasty that has ruled India for most of its post-independence era.And yet few at the gathering were aware that just a week earlier she had performed an even more dramatic about-face, agreeing to a raft of economic reforms that would be unveiled on September 13 and 14.Gandhi has no official government post, but as Congress party president and torchbearer of India's widely revered first family, she has the last word on big policy issues: and for her, social welfare has always come before liberalizing the economy.However, more than a dozen officials and party leaders close to the secretive inner circle of the Italian-born leader told Reuters that Gandhi was persuaded of the need for urgent action to avert a repeat of the crisis that took India to the brink of bankruptcy in 1991."This time there was a very grim scenario," said Rashid Kidwai, a Sonia Gandhi biographer who was given an account of the arguments made over weeks by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his new finance minister behind the closed doors of colonial-era government bungalows in New Delhi and even on a plane journey."It's not that she wanted to go for all this, but it was made very clear to her that, if she didn't, there would be far more dire consequences," Kidwai said.Sources said the trigger for the reform campaign in Asia's third-largest economy came with the return of P. Chidambaram as finance minister on August 1.An eloquent Harvard-educated technocrat with a track record as a reformer, he replaced Pranab Mukherjee, a left-of-centre Congress stalwart who had consistently warned Gandhi against radical reforms that could cost the party votes."Pranab was from the old school of Indian politics," said a senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The prime minister and the finance minister had to persuade Mrs. Gandhi that good economics was good politics."Her acquiescence in the end led to this month's "big bang Friday" when, a day after taking an axe to costly subsidies on diesel, the government announced that the retail market would be opened to foreign supermarket chains and the bar on foreign investment in both airlines and broadcasters would be lifted.In sum, these were the most sweeping reforms since Singh took office in 2004 and - in the space of 48 hours - they dispelled the image of a prime minister who was losing his mojo as India's high-trajectory growth faltered.A RELUCTANT REFORMERHowever, insiders say Gandhi remains instinctively wary of economic liberalization and trimming the budget deficit. For months, she had held out against cutting fuel subsidies that are aimed at the poor and the country's rural majority, fearing the impact on the Congress party's fortunes.She only agreed when Singh and Chidambaram spelled out that new growth generated by reforms and improved investor sentiment would have a trickle-down effect and provide funds for welfare spending in time for elections due by mid-2014."They explained to Mrs. Gandhi that social benefits for the poor will need deep pockets," said a Congress party source who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential.Reuters reviewed more than 30 letters written by Gandhi to the prime minister and U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks that portray her as passionate about social issues, and attached to protecting the poor.That means the sudden burst of reforms could be cut short if Gandhi - who Forbes magazine ranks as the world's sixth most powerful woman - sees no benefits for the rural poor on whom her party relies for votes.Indeed, party sources said she will now focus on passing a bill on universal food security in December, a populist plan that would cost billions of dollars at a time when her government is under intense pressure to rein in spending."She just wants enough budgetary resources available to finance her welfare schemes," said Swapan Dasgupta, a prominent journalist and commentator who leans towards the opposition."She has never spoken about reforms. What she has done is make Congress think of reforms as a low priority and a political liability - she has ingrained that mindset in the party."A request to interview Gandhi was declined.PARAMOUNT POWERSonia Gandhi, 65, carries the authority of a political family that, after India won independence from Britain in 1947, drove a vision of democratic socialism to uplift the vast rural masses. With that came a mind-boggling range of controls that tied the economy down and kept it closed to global markets.A turning point came in 1991 when a slump in exports following the collapse of the Soviet Union and a leap in oil import costs due to the Gulf War tipped the country into a balance of payments crisis.Manmohan Singh, then finance minister, responded with shock treatment, devaluing the rupee by nearly 19 percent. So determined was he to push this through, when the prime minister of the day got cold feet, he reportedly blamed the infamous inefficiency of India's telephone system to pretend that he couldn't contact the central bank in time.His moves to prise open the economy set the stage for a long run of dazzling growth that peaked at 9.7 percent in 2006/07.Although Gandhi appointed Singh as prime minister when the Congress party returned to power eight years ago, she has a far more socialist mindset than the Oxford-educated economist who drove that first round of reforms.Sources close to the Gandhi family say she has been strongly influenced by her late mother-in-law, former prime minister Indira Gandhi, whose policies were considerably left of centre.Sonia Gandhi initially declined the throne of the Congress party after the 1991 assassination of her husband and former prime minister, Rajiv, but she finally agreed to enter politics six years later to lift the flagging fortunes of the party under her family's brand name.As party president and chairperson of the ruling coalition, she has kept a low and almost enigmatic profile, appearing to stand above the political fray. When she went abroad for surgery last year there was no official word on her illness, and the media tamely accorded her the privacy a royal might expect.But Gandhi wields extraordinary power behind the scenes, shaping policy out of the public eye with a tight circle of decision-makers and relying on back-channel negotiations to manage relations with fractious coalition alliesRatings agency Standard & Poor's, warning earlier this year that India could become the first of the emerging market BRICS economies to lose its investment-grade rating, took a swipe at her resistance to policies mooted by Singh."The Congress party is divided on economic policies. There is substantial opposition within the party to any serious liberalization of the economy," S&P said."Moreover, paramount political power rests with the leader of the Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, who holds no cabinet position, while the government is led by an unelected prime minister ... who lacks a political base of his own."A BENEVOLENT MATRIARCHGandhi gives little away about her thinking on economic policy, but dispatches from the U.S. embassy in New Delhi during the early years of Singh's tenure show she made "repeated objections" to proposed hikes in fuel prices, which are heavily subsidized to cushion the poor."Key leaders (including Sonia Gandhi) have opposed the price hikes, criticized the way they have been handled, or urged Congress to capitulate to ... demands for a 'rollback', and the party is finding it difficult to speak with one voice," one of the cables said.Describing a leader who projects herself as a benevolent matriarch, the dispatches were scathing about one of her pet projects, a scheme guaranteeing 100 days of paid employment per year for rural citizens. "At worst, the jobs plan is political patronage run amok and horrid economic policy," one said.Gandhi also set up the National Advisory Council, a government-funded think tank that offers legislative guidance on social policy and the rights of disadvantaged groups.A batch of letters Gandhi wrote as chairperson of the council, which were recently released under the Right to Information Act, illustrate where her priorities lie.Writing to the prime minister and several ministers, she drew their attention to issues such as legal entitlement to subsidized foodgrains, child labor, housing for the poor and "indiscriminate acquisition" of agricultural land for private companies. In one letter, she closed by urging a minister: "You may like to have the matter examined appropriately".WARNINGS OF IMPENDING CRISISHow was Gandhi persuaded that, as one government official put it, "if you are not growing you are distributing poverty"?For one thing, the economy was in trouble. Growth had dropped to its lowest clip in three years, the fiscal deficit was blowing past official targets, and the government was under heavy fire for sitting on its hands as the crisis mounted.With Mukherjee gone from the Finance Ministry, Singh and Chidambaram made their move, warning Gandhi of a possible slump in the rupee and even a repeat of 1991, sources said."There were three meetings over about four weeks ... to tell her that if we don't do all this it will be bad politics," said the senior government official.Singh also tackled Gandhi at length on the issue in July during a flight from Delhi to the northeastern state of Assam.Adding his voice at a separate meeting, Commerce Minister Anand Sharma explained to Gandhi that opening up to global supermarkets like Wal-Mart Stores Inc could tame the corruption that plagues the state-run food distribution network - a compelling argument after two years of graft scandals that have damaged her government.When Gandhi returned in September from a medical check-up abroad, the stage was set for 'big bang Friday'.And although the reforms triggered the walkout of a key coalition partner from the government, reducing it to a minority, she has resisted calls for a U-turn and even plans to join a street march in favor of the retail sector reform.Gandhi's ambition in all this is to ensure that the Congress party returns to power in 2014, with her son - Rahul - at the helm of the government after eight years waiting in the wings."What she is concentrating on is really the need to be re-elected," said M.J. Akbar, a former Congress party lawmaker and once a trusted Gandhi family insider. "The only thing wrong about this reforms business though is ... they left it too close to the election."(Additional reporting by Ross Colvin and Raju Gopalakrishnan; Editing by Dean Yates)	4	3	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4
302	instagram-now-more-daily-active-users-mobile-twitter-112426992	Mark Zuckerberg must be smiling right now.[More from Mashable: Kenny Chesney Kicks Off His Shoes With New App]Instagram passed Twitter in daily active users on mobile in August for the first time, according to new comScore data provided to Mashable. Instagram had 7.3 million daily mobile users for the month, while Twitter had 6.9 million.In fact, comScore's data shows that Instagram's daily active user count has almost increased tenfold in the six-month period starting in March, when it had 886,000 daily active visitors. Twitter's mobile user numbers have increased as well, but at a much slower rate. Part of this may simply be due to the fact that Instagram is a younger company, but it's impressive nonetheless.[More from Mashable: Facebook Bug Creates Wall Posts That Can Never Be Deleted]Twitter did end up having more total unique visitors in August than Instagram overall (29 million vs. 21 million, respectively), but fewer of them returned on a daily basis, and Twitter's visitors spent less time on average viewing content than visitors to Instagram. Each of Instagram's mobile users spent an average of 257 minutes on the app (or more than four hours), while Twitter's users spent an average of 169.9 minutes from mobile (or a little less than three hours.)The data comes from comScore's Mobile Metrix 2.0 tool, which uses survey data and on-device metering to provide a more comprehensive estimate of mobile usage for various websites and apps. The data factors in visits to the apps and websites for Instagram and Twitter from iOS, Android and BlackBerry mobile devices. However, it obviously doesn't take into account the number of active users who visit a website from a non-mobile device, which would certainly tilt in favor of Twitter.Facebook acquired Instagram for around $735 million earlier this year (the deal was initially worth more than $1 billion, but the value declined with Facebook's stock.) In an S-1 filing earlier this year, Zuckerberg explained that part of the reason he wanted Instagram was to "enable users to increase their levels of mobile engagement and photo sharing."The latest comScore numbers clearly show that Instagram has figured out mobile engagement. Now the question is: When will Facebook capitalize on this by finding ways to monetize Instagram? Twitter may have fallen behind Instagram in daily active users, but the social network already has an advertising model in place that is expected to help it earn more in mobile ad revenue this year than Facebook.Image courtesy of Flickr, The_Next_StepThis story originally published on Mashable here.	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	4	3	1	1	1	3	4
303	iphone-5-launch-draws-apple-fans-across-asia-053847444--finance	HONG KONG (AP) — In a now familiar global ritual, Apple fans jammed shops from Sydney to Tokyo to pick up the tech juggernaut's latest iPhone.Eager buyers formed long lines Friday at Apple Inc. stores in Australia and Japan to be the first to get their hands on the latest version of the smartphone. In Hong Kong and Singapore, buyers had to sign up online for the chance to pick up the device at a prearranged time. The first customers in Hong Kong were greeted by staff cheering, clapping, chanting "iPhone 5! iPhone 5!" and high-fiving them as they were escorted one-by-one through the front door.The smartphone is also being launched in the U.S., U.K., Canada, France and Germany. It will go on sale in 22 more countries a week later. The iPhone 5 is thinner, lighter, has a taller screen, faster processor, updated software and can work on faster "fourth generation" mobile networks.Order numbers indicate the iPhone 5 has overcome initial lukewarm reviews. Apple received 2 million orders in the first 24 hours of announcing its release date, more than twice the number for the iPhone 4S in the same period when that phone launched a year ago.In a sign of the intense demand, police in Osaka, Japan, were investigating the theft of nearly 200 iPhones 5s, including 116 from one shop alone, Kyodo News reported.Analysts have estimated Apple will ship as many as 10 million of the new iPhones by the end of September.Some Australian fans went to extremes to be among the first by arriving at Apple's flagship store in downtown Sydney on Tuesday — three days ahead of the release.Todd Foot, 24, nabbed the coveted first spot and spent about 18 hours a day in a folding chair and catching a few hours' sleep each night in a tent on the sidewalk.Foot's dedication was largely a marketing stunt, however. He writes product reviews for a technology website that will give away the phone after Foot reviews it."I just want to get the phone so I can feel it, compare it and put it on our website," he said while slumped in his chair.In Singapore, which doesn't have an Apple store, Liu Ting Ting waited 12 hours to be the first of 10,000 people in the Southeast Asian city-state granted the opportunity to buy one at a Singapore Telecommunications launch-day event."I have this I-need-to-be-first mentality because this is the first time I'm buying an iPhone," said Liu, who is dumping her Blackberry because she believes the iPhone 5's photo and video capabilities will help with her journalism studies."If I wasn't the first, I would have gone home," she said.Not everyone lining up outside Hong Kong's Apple store was an enthusiast. University student Kevin Wong, waiting to buy a black 16 gigabyte model for 5,588 Hong Kong dollars ($720), said he was getting one "for the cash." He planned to immediately resell it to one of the numerous grey market retailers catering to visiting mainland Chinese buyers. China is one of Apple's fastest growing markets but a release date for the iPhone 5 there has not yet been set.Mainland Chinese, who like to shop in Hong Kong because there's no sales tax and because of the strength of the yuan, will probably buy it from the resellers "at a higher price — a way higher price," said Wong, who hoped to make a profit of HK$1,000 ($129).Tokyo's glitzy downtown Ginza district not only had a long line in front of the Apple store, but another across the main intersection at Softbank, the first carrier in Japan to offer iPhones.Hidetoshi Nakamura, a 25-year-old auto engineer, said he's an Apple fan because it's an innovator."I love Apple," he said, standing near the end of a two-block-long line, reading a book and listening to music on his iPod."It's only the iPhone for me."___Kristen Gelineau in Sydney, Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo and Faris Mokhtar in Singapore contributed to this report.Follow Kelvin Chan on at twitter.com/chanman	4	3	3	3	4	3	2	4	3	2	3	2	1	1	3	4

306	iran-accuses-iaea-passing-nuclear-secrets-israel-161201740--sector	DUBAI (Reuters) - A senior Iranian lawmaker accused the UN nuclear watchdog on Sunday of passing confidential details of Iran's atomic work to Israel, and a military commander said Tehran may consider a pre-emptive strike on the Jewish state if it looked set to attack.Javad Jahangirzadeh, a member of parliament's presiding board, said International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano had made "repeated trips" to Israel, divulging sensitive information about what Tehran says is its peaceful nuclear program."Amano's repeated trips to Tel Aviv and asking the Israeli officials' views about Iran's nuclear activities indicates that Iran's nuclear information has been disclosed to the Zionist regime and other enemies of the Islamic Republic," Jahangirzadeh was quoted as saying by Iran's English-language Press TV.The IAEA declined to comment. Records show Amano has made only one visit to Israel in his capacity as IAEA chief, in August 2010. He visited Tehran in May this year."If the agency's actions lead to Iran cutting cooperation with this international body, all responsibility will be with the IAEA director general," said Jahangirzadeh, also a member of parliament's national security and foreign policy committee.After weeks of increased hints by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel could strike Iran's nuclear sites, prompting speculation that might happen before U.S. elections in November, an Iranian military commander said Iran could strike first if sure Israel were poised to attack."Iran will not start any war but it could launch a pre-emptive attack if it was sure that the enemies are putting the final touches to attack it," Iran's state-run Arabic language Al-Alam television quoted Amir Ali Hajizadeh, a brigadier general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as saying.While Hajizadeh's comments might be seen as part of the usual hawkish rhetoric from the Iranian military, the politician's accusation against the IAEA's Amano suggest Tehran's relations with the agency are severely strained.INFILTRATEDLast week, Iranian nuclear energy chief Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani said "terrorists" might have infiltrated the Vienna-based agency.He suggested the IAEA included too much sensitive information about Iran's nuclear program in its reports that he said could be used by saboteurs.Western diplomats dismissed his allegations as an attempt to distract attention away from the agency's bid to gain access to a site in Iran it suspects was used for nuclear weapons research, something Tehran denies.Iran blames Israel and its Western allies for the assassination of nuclear scientists in Iran, including an unsuccessful attempt on Abbasi-Davani in November 2010. It also blames those countries for computer viruses that appeared designed to damage its nuclear machinery.The 35-nation board of the agency censured Iran earlier this month for defying international demands to curb uranium enrichment and failing to address mounting disquiet about its suspected research into atomic bombs.The resolution prompted Iran's Parliament Speaker, Ali Larijani, to cast doubt on the benefit of Iran's membership in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Tehran Times reported.In another allegation of underhand behavior against Iran, the head of parliament's national security and foreign policy committee said German engineering company Siemens had planted explosives in equipment it sold to Iran for use in its nuclear program.Siemens, which was building a nuclear power station in Iran before the Islamic Revolution that toppled the shah in 1979, denied Alaeddin Boroujerdi's accusation."Siemens does not have any business ties with Iran's nuclear program and does not supply any technical equipment for it," a spokesman for the Munich-based multinational said.(Additional reporting by Fredrik Dahl in Vienna, Maria Sheahan in Frankfurt, Zahra Hosseinian in Zurich; Editing by Robin Pomeroy)	4	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	3	1	1	2	4	3

310	iraq-bars-syria-bound-plane-suspected-arms-181758361	BEIRUT (AP) — Iraq has banned a North Korean plane from its airspace on suspicion it was carrying weapons for Syria, a government spokesman said Friday, potentially closing a supply line for President Bashar Assad's embattled regime.U.S. officials have accused Baghdad of allowing Iran to fly weapons to Syrian forces through Iraqi airspace, a charge Iraq has denied. North Korea and Iran are allies of Assad whose military is fighting a civil war against rebels trying to topple him.In remarks published Friday, Assad was adamant that the rebels "will not succeed" and said a foreign military intervention such as the one that helped topple Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi will "not be repeated" in Syria.Assad's comments come at a time of bloody stalemate, with neither side able to deliver a knock-out blow. Activists on Friday raised the number of people killed in the 18-month conflict to nearly 30,000. Daily death tolls have been rising in recent weeks, with the regime attacking from the air and some rebels using heavy weapons.Both sides have foreign backers. Assad's allies include Russia and China, along with Iran and North Korea, while the rebels are supported by the U.S. and Western allies, Turkey and several Gulf states, such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia.On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department identified 117 Iranian aircraft it said were ferrying weapons to the Syrian regime. The department said the planes were delivering weapons and Iranian forces under the cover of "humanitarian" shipments.Iraq has accepted Iranian assurances that it is not using Iraqi airspace to smuggle weapons into Syria, the Obama administration's choice for ambassador to Iraq, R. Stephen Beecroft, said earlier this week. He said the U.S. is pressing the Iraqi government, whose Shiite-led coalition has close ties with Iran, to force flights to land and be inspected.Iraq has denied it is turning a blind eye to suspected Iranian weapons shipments, but on Thursday banned a North Korean plane from using its airspace. The government rejected the request from Pyongyang to fly a plane to Syria through Iraqi skies, on suspicion it carried weapons, government spokesman Ali al-Moussawi confirmed Friday.Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, an ally of Iran, has denied repeatedly that he is allowing weapons trafficking and has said Baghdad will remain neutral in the Syria conflict.The issue has been a sore point between Baghdad and Washington. It was raised again in a phone call Friday between al-Maliki and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden. The vice president spoke of the need "to prevent any state from taking advantage of Iraq's territory or air space to send weapons to Syria," the White House said.Iraq's decision to ban the North Korean plane may signal Baghdad's attempts to repair weakening relations with the United States.In Damascus, meanwhile, Assad lashed out at Gulf countries, which he accused of using their enormous oil wealth to try to drive him from power. He singled out Saudi Arabia and Qatar, among his most vocal critics."They think their money can buy geography, history and a regional role," Assad was quoted as saying in the Egyptian weekly Al-Ahram Al-Arabi."They are giving terrorists weapons and money with hope of repeating the Libyan model," Assad added. "Instead of helping regional stability, they are supplying armed elements with weapons and training in order to weaken the Syrian state."The upheaval in Syria presents an opportunity for the Gulf's Sunni rulers to bolster their influence and possibly leave Shiite powerhouse Iran without its critical alliances that flow through Damascus. Assad's regime is led by the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.Syria's ties with the Gulf nations have been strained in the past — Assad once called Saudi King Abdullah and other Arab leaders "half men" for being critical of Hezbollah over the 34-day war between the Lebanese Shiite militant group and Israel in 2006.After Assad's remarks were published, Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoebi told state-run TV that the president had received nine Egyptian journalists and had a chat with them about the latest developments.The minister said none of the journalists took notes as the meeting was considered a "personal visit," but a reporter for Al-Ahram Al-Arabi published some of what was said.In the meeting with the Egyptian journalists, Assad was also quoted as saying that the only way to solve the Syrian crisis is through "dialogue with the opposition" and that the "door for dialogue is open."Most Syrian opposition groups reject any talks with the regime, saying they will not accept anything less than Assad's departure from power and the dissolving of his regime's security agencies.One of the opposition groups, the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change in Syria, on Friday accused the regime of being behind the disappearance of two of its leaders.Abdul-Aziz al-Kheir and Ayas Ayyash were expected to take part in a conference Sunday in Damascus by some 20 Syrian groups that are calling for Assad to step down. But they disappeared Thursday along with a friend who had picked them up at Damascus International Airport, the group said.The group's head, Hassan Abdul-Azim, said the regime was believed to be behind the disappearance. Openly disparaging the regime has always been taboo and fraught with danger in Syria, although some have grown emboldened because of the uprising.Abdul-Azim said the opposition wants a "new regime that represents the will of the people." He said his group will go ahead with the conference. The gathering will invite European ambassadors and envoys from China and Russia.Also Friday, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nearly 30,000 Syrians have been killed during the conflict.The Observatory's count includes 20,935 civilians; 1,153 army defectors fighting alongside the rebels; and 7,141 Syrian troops fighting for the Assad regime — which gives a total of 29,229, said the head of the group, Rami Abdul-Rahman.The list is compiled from reports by witnesses and medical staff, he said, adding that he only includes those identified by name or whose death was authenticated by amateur video. The Syrian military rarely releases figures on troops killed.Another Syrian opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees, put the overall death toll at 26,405. However, its count does not include Syrian troops killed in battle. The LCC relies on a network of activists in Syria to collect its information.____Associated Press writers Karin Laub in Beirut and Sameer N.

311	iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774	DUBAI (Reuters) - Iraq will ask Syria-bound Iranian planes passing through its airspace to land for random inspections after Washington said they could be ferrying arms to Damascus, the Iraqi foreign minister said in an interview.U.S. officials had raised their concerns over the past few days on the sidelines of United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York, Hoshiyar Zebari told the London-based al-Hayat newspaper."We have informed Mrs Clinton (U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton) and U.S. officials that the government plans to bring planes down and conduct random inspections," Zebari said in the interview published on Sunday. He confirmed he was referring to Iranian planes.Washington had already said it was asking Iraq about Iranian flights suspected of carrying arms to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a staunch Iranian ally fighting an 18-month-old revolt against his rule.Iraq has said it would never allow any arms to pass through its airspace to either side in the conflict.The government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shi'ite Muslim, is close to regional Shi'ite power Iran. Iran is one of the main allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who follows an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam.Maliki has opposed demands by Sunni Muslim Arab Gulf nations that Assad step down to end the escalating crisis.Zebari said the U.S. officials had said any flights carrying weapons to Syrian would break U.N. Security Council resolutions, and demanded Iraq stop them.Washington had provided no specific intelligence of such flights, he added.Iranian flights over Iraq had begun in March and stopped after Iraq asked that they be halted, the minister told the newspaper."They resumed again towards the end of July and they said these flights contain no weapons or hardware, and that they transport pilgrims, visitors and so on. But to verify their shipments, we will ask these planes to land," he said.Zebari said Iraq opposed any foreign intervention in Syria and favored a negotiated solution that would ensure a peaceful transition in Syria, starting with an immediate ceasefire.He added Iraq had proposed holding another meeting of world powers on Syria as a follow up to the talks held in Geneva in June."What we have proposed to (Russian Foreign Minister Sergei) Lavrov is perhaps there is a need to convene a 'Geneva 2' to activate mechanisms for implementing what has been agreed upon and not to reopen the discussions," he said.The Geneva meeting agreed a transitional government should be set up in Syria, but the major powers were at odds over what part Assad might play in the process.(Reporting by Sami Aboudi; Editing by Andrew Heavens)	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	4	3	2	3	3	4

314	israel-quiet-ahmadinejad-yom-kippur-descends-164244877	JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli leaders made no comment on Tuesday over the latest outburst from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, maintaining near-total silence as the country closed down for the holiest Jewish day of the year, Yom Kippur.The Day or Atonement runs from Tuesday afternoon through to dusk on Wednesday, meaning there was no comment either on U.S. President Barack Obama's address to the United Nations.Speaking in New York, Ahmadinejad said on Monday Israel had no roots in the Middle East and would be "eliminated".It was the latest piece of fiery rhetoric from the Iranian leader, who has regularly riled Israel and fueled concern that if the Islamic Republic one day obtained nuclear weapons it might turn them on the Jewish State.Israel's ambassador to the United Nations denounced the comments but ministers and officials in Israel were silent. There was also little mention of his words in the Israeli press on Tuesday, which was focused instead on domestic politics.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior advisers, speaking in private, have shrugged off Ahmadinejad's statements in the past, saying he did not have a policy-making role when it came to Iran's disputed nuclear program.Instead, they scrutinize the utterances of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who, they say, is the person responsible for crucial decision-making.Speaking on Monday in Jerusalem, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor said he had no intention of getting into a slanging match with Iranian officials, adding that Israel was used to being on the receiving end of incendiary rhetoric.Israel has threatened military action against Iran unless it renounces its ambitious nuclear program, which Tehran says is purely for civilian purposes but which many countries in the West believe is designed at creating an Atomic bomb.Obama told the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that time was running out to find a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. "The United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon," he added.However, his statement represented no advance on the previous U.S. position and he appeared to ignore Netanyahu's call for Washington to establish clear red lines for Iran.The Israeli leader is due to fly to New York once Yom Kippur ends and will address the General Assembly on Thursday. His office has said Obama declined a request to meet the U.S. president, but the two were expected to speak by telephone.As every year, Israel ground to a halt at the approach of Yom Kippur. Radio and television went off the air, the national airport was shut and the streets emptied.In 1973, a coalition of Arab states launched a surprise attack on Israel during the Jewish holy day, threatening to overwhelm the country.

316	israeli-electric-car-company-ceo-steps-down-171457798--finance	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli electric car company Better Place said Tuesday that its founder and chief executive was stepping down.Shai Agassi leaves behind a company that has won widespread praise and attention for his dream of ending the world's dependence on oil, but which has struggled at times to carry out that vision.The circumstances surrounding his departure were not immediately clear. In a statement Tuesday, company Chairman Idan Ofer said it had achieved its goals under Agassi and had reached a "natural point" for change."Under Shai's leadership, we've successfully achieved our goals in the first chapter of Better Place, and we owe Shai our gratitude for turning his powerful vision into a reality," Ofer said. "It is almost five years to the day since Shai launched Better Place and a natural point in the company's evolution to realign for its second chapter and for the challenges and opportunities ahead."The chief executive of Better Place's Australian business, Even Thornley, will take over. Agassi, a former top executive at German software maker SAP, will remain on Better Place's board.Better Place says it aims to wean the world off fossil fuel via a network of charging stations and infrastructure to power electric cars.Through a partnership with Renault, Better Place is close to completing nationwide networks in Israel and Denmark. For longer trips, its infrastructure includes changing stations that allow travelers to swap their batteries in a matter of minutes, avoiding the lengthy process of recharging.But the company has burned through hundreds of millions of dollars, caused in part by a slow rollout of its network and reluctance by consumers to adopt electric cars.The company says that despite the heavy startup costs, it remains on solid footing and is optimistic about the future. After testing the system for several months, it recently began sales of its all-electric Renault Fluence model to the general public.Altogether, it says it has raised $750 million and recently secured a 40 million euro loan from the European Investment Bank.	3	3	2	3	3	3	2	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	3	4

319	iuds-implants-urged-teen-girls-birth-control-210745668	CHICAGO (AP) — Teenage girls may prefer the pill, the patch or even wishful thinking, but their doctors should be recommending IUDs or hormonal implants — long-lasting and more effective birth control that you don't have to remember to use every time, the nation's leading gynecologists group said Thursday.The IUD and implants are safe and nearly 100 percent effective at preventing pregnancy, and should be "first-line recommendations," the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in updating its guidance for teens.Both types of contraception are more invasive than the pill, requiring a doctor to put them in place. That, and cost, are probably why the pill is still the most popular form of contraception in the U.S.But birth control pills often must be taken at the very same time every day to be most potent. And forgetting to take even one can lead to pregnancy, which is why the pill is sometimes only 91 percent effective.An IUD, or intrauterine device, is a small, T-shaped piece of plastic inserted in the uterus that can prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years. An implant is a matchstick-size plastic rod that releases hormones. It is placed under the skin of the upper arm and usually lasts three years.The new guidelines don't tell teens not to use other methods, but "if your goal is to prevent a pregnancy, then using an implant or an IUD would be the best way to do this," said Dr. Tina Raine-Bennett, head of the committee that wrote the recommendations.The organization's previous guidelines, issued in 2007, also encouraged the use of IUDs and implants among teenagers. The new guidelines go further in saying physicians should discuss the two types of birth control with sexually active teens at every doctor visit.The gynecologists group said condoms should still be used at all times because no other birth control method protects against AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.While it may sound surprising that such invasive contraceptives are being endorsed for teenagers, 43 percent of girls ages 15 to 19 have had sex, a government survey found. Most are using some kind of effective birth control, but only about 5 percent use the long-lasting devices, the gynecologists group said.In 21 states, all teenagers can get contraceptives without parental permission, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks laws affecting women's health. A few other states allow it under certain circumstances.The IUD and implant cost hundreds of dollars. The new health reform law requires health insurance plans to cover birth control without co-payments. Also, some publicly funded health clinics offer birth control free or at a reduced cost.The American Academy of Pediatrics has been more cautious and has not endorsed specific methods of birth control, but is updating its guidance. Some pediatricians have been reluctant to recommend IUDs for teens, partly because of concerns over infection risks; an older model was blamed for infertility.Dr. Paula Braverman, a University of Cincinnati physician involved in updating the academy's position, said the gynecologists' advice does a good job of clarifying misconceptions about IUDs and implants.An IUD called the Dalkon Shield that was sold in the 1970s was linked to dangerous and sometimes deadly infections. Newer IUDs have been found to be safe, and the gynecologists group said the risk of pelvic infections increases only slightly during the first three weeks after insertion.The hormonal implant has been updated, too. The newest kind uses just one thin rod; an older type no longer sold in the U.S. used six rods that sometimes didn't stay in place. IUDs and implants can be removed at any time with no lasting effect on fertility, the gynecologists group said."The ones on the market today are extremely safe," said Dr. Mary Fournier, an adolescent-medicine specialist at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital, who praised the new recommendations. "That is what everybody should be telling their patients."She said she already recommends IUDs for her patients and is being trained in how to insert birth control implants.Raine-Bennett, research director for women's health at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., said she gets mixed reactions from her patients about both methods."Some of them say, 'Great! Something that I don't have to think about.' Others are, like, 'Hmmm, something in my body?' It really varies," she said.Doctors need to be sensitive to that and provide detailed information to dispel any myths and allow teens to make informed decisions, Raine-Bennett said.___Online:ACOG: http://www.acog.orgCDC birth control information: http://tinyurl.com/nhrf9p___AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/LindseyTanner	3	4	4	2	4	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	2	2	3	4
320	ivory-coast-scrap-grinding-subsidy-lift-transport-support-152905040--sector	ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast will abolish a 20-year-old tax break given to local cocoa grinders when the 2012/13 season starts on October 1, an official with the top grower's marketing board told Reuters on Saturday, in a victory for exporters who don't grind locally.The move was announced at a board meeting of the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) late on Friday during which the body also decided to increase a key transportation-reimbursement allowance at the heart of a row threatening reform of the sector.Exporters Cargill, Barry Callebaut, CEMOI and ADM, who process a portion of their cocoa domestically, all benefit from a reduced DUS ("droit unique de sortie") tax - the main cocoa export tax - and stand to lose if the tax break is scrapped.Rival exporters say the subsidy gives the grinders an unfair advantage and cost Ivory Coast 34 billion CFA francs in 2010. Farmers argue that this lost tax money should have been reinvested in the sector."The president of the (CCC) informed the board of directors of the government's decision to totally repeal the fiscal advantage given to cocoa grinders," a board member told Reuters, asking not to be named."This decision takes effect starting with the next harvest and should allow everyone to work together on equal footing," he said.The government introduced tax incentives for local grinders during the 1991/1992 cocoa season to encourage investment in the country, create jobs in the cocoa sector, and increase grinding capacity.Initially meant to last five years and apply only to exports during the April to September mid-crop, the incentives are now granted year-round and are currently worth about 75 CFA francs per kilogram of cocoa.In 2010, Ivory Coast became the world's top cocoa grinder with a capacity of 532,000 tonnes, turned mainly into cocoa butter and powder.As part of a sweeping reform of the cocoa sector, the government is aiming to locally grind half of its cocoa bean production by 2015. Currently around 35 percent of beans are processed locally.Cocoa grinders have however said the incentives do not give them any special advantage and that removing them could hurt the local grinding industry and even push some to move plants to neighbouring Ghana, the world's second-biggest producer after Ivory Coast.TRANSPORT COSTSThe new cocoa season opens next month under a government-led scheme that uses the proceeds from forward-selling of the crop to guarantee prices for farmers and encourage them to reinvest in their plantations.The Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) is due within days to set a farmgate price, as well as a scale of cost reimbursement for exporters, including handling costs incurred to get the beans from farm to port.But exporter and merchant groups have said that if the anticipated transportation and collection cost allowances are not increased, they will ignore the government's farmgate price.The CCC has now informally suggested an increased allowance of 70 CFA francs per kg, but exporters have demanded an increase to 94.2 francs."The transport and collection cost...was raised from 70 francs to 80 francs," the CCC official said."The board of directors decided on this increase to avoid a blockage in October...This is the maximum we can do for them."	4	4	3	3	4	3	2	3	3	2	3	1	1	1	3	4
321	ivory-coast-sees-9-pct-gdp-growth-2013-152403762--sector	ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's economy will grow by 8.6 percent in 2012 and 9 percent in 2013, government spokesman Bruno Kone said on Tuesday following a cabinet meeting.The West African state's economy was previously expected to grow by 8.1 percent in 2012, its first full year since a brief civil war ground business to a temporary halt.Kone said the government would propose a 2013 budget of 3,814 billion CFA francs, up 17 percent from 2012, on the back of the robust growth projections.	4	4	3	4	2	3	4	3	2	2	2	1	2	2	2	4
322	jack-johnson-breaks-no-social-media-rule-voter-123525067	Singer-songwriter Jack Johnson doesn't consider himself a tech-savvy guy -- in fact, he calls himself "an old fart" who doesn't tweet or even go on Facebook, but on Tuesday he will join the largest social media-driven voter registration campaign to mark the inaugural National Voter Registration Day.[More from Mashable: ‘Unavoidable’ Bacon Shortage Leads to Twitter Hysteria]Johnson, along with more than 200 celebrities from Stephen Colbert to 50 Cent, will be sending tweets and posting Facebook updates to encourage people to register. Each message will also include a photo of the celebrity holding up a clipboard that says "Register to Vote."The campaign is run by voter registration organization HeadCount.[More from Mashable: Former Twitter CEO Says Network Needs a Better Metric Than Follower Count]"HeadCount comes to our shows and volunteers walk around with clipboards to get people to sign up to vote. It's amazing to look at the numbers and see the impact it can have on registration," Jack Johnson told Mashable in a phone interview. "I'm looking forward to seeing how it translates to the Internet."HeadCount says that registering this year is crucial because many young voters who first cast a Presidential ballot in 2008 might be in for a surprise when they head to the polls this year. A recent survey found that seven out of 10 young people have moved in the past four years, according to the organization, and 43% of those potential voters haven't updated their voter registration since.Due to new voter ID laws in some states that require voters to prove they live at the address where they are registered, this could prevent millions of people from voting on Election Day. About 52% said they didn't know or were unsure if they were registered to vote under their current address.The campaign will also happen offline in more than 30 U.S. cities at locations such as transportation centers, retail stores and concerts.Johnson, who supports a number of non-profit organizations, says he is thrilled to participate in a movement that will influence a large amount of potential voters."I've always been grateful to the Internet -- without it, my music wouldn't have stood a chance," Johnson said. "Back when I got started, people were learning to burn CDs and that was great because it allowed my album to spread even though it was in limited distribution. The web can be very powerful."Although he said he would make an exception to support the cause, he's not as active on Twitter and Facebook as his fellow music contemporaries: "It works out great for some artists, but when I think back on my favorite artists such as Bob Marley, I can't picture him tweeting. I guess I keep it a little more romantic and mysterious that way."Johnson's Twitter account (@JackJohnson) is run by his management team, but on Tuesday, he will get more involved. When not rallying around the cause, Johnson says he is taking time now to "really live life" and gear up for a new album."Right now, I'm writing songs and recording sometime in the near future," he said. "It's a little bit of an inhale, exhale thing -- I want to take enough time to read books and take in life, rather than just putting things out all at once."Other musicians participating in HeadCount's social media campaign include Dave Matthews, John Legend and Reba McIntyre.The deadline to register to vote in some states is as early as October 6.Image via Flickr, BurnStarThis story originally published on Mashable here.	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	2	1	3	4
323	japan-posts-9-6b-august-trade-gap-exports-061634602--finance	TOKYO (AP) — Japan posted a $9.6 billion trade deficit for August as shipments to Europe and Asian countries sank, further undermining hopes for an export-driven revival in the world's third-biggest economy.The 754.1 billion yen ($9.6 billion) deficit in August was not much smaller than the $9.9 billion deficit reported a year earlier, the Finance Ministry reported Thursday. Exports in August totaled 5.05 trillion yen ($64.33 billion), down 5.8 percent from a year earlier, while imports fell 5.4 percent to 5.8 trillion yen ($73.9 billion).The strong Japanese yen has bit into exports while demand has evaporated in crisis-stricken Europe. Meanwhile, the country's energy imports have risen following closures of most of its nuclear plants.Japan's central bank, which on Wednesday announced it would boost the size and duration of a government bond-buying program to spur growth, forecast little change in the immediate future."Exports and industrial production are expected to remain relatively weak for the time being," the Bank of Japan said in its monthly report, released Thursday.Japan has eked out small trade surpluses in some months this year but reported a record annual trade deficit for the fiscal year that ended in March.Though the deficit for August was lower than the more than 800 billion yen that some analysts had forecast, prolonged weakness in Europe and recent friction with China, Japan's biggest overseas market, suggest the trade gap will likely persist in coming months.Exports to Europe dived 28 percent in August from a year earlier to 484.9 billion yen ($6.2 billion) while exports to Asia — Japan's biggest overseas market — sank 6.7 percent overall to 2.84 trillion yen ($36.2 billion).Even before a recent territorial dispute flared, sparking anti-Japanese riots across China, exports were weakening. They fell 9.9 percent from a year earlier to 966.3 billion yen ($12.3 billion), the Finance Ministry reported.The central bank's bond-buying program is meant to encourage borrowing and spending and make Japan's exports more competitive, while also exerting downward pressure on interest rates and on the yen.The central bank acknowledged that Japan's economic rebound had stalled, but predicted it would return to a "moderate" recovery path in the longer term. Its report cited resilient domestic demand thanks to reconstruction in northeastern regions devastated by a March 2011 tsunami and earthquake and signs of quickening activity in the housing sector.Central banks already have pushed short-term rates nearly as low as possible. That leaves government bond purchases as one of their few remaining tools, though their impact appears limited.The Japanese yen weakened Wednesday to 79.17 per dollar by mid-afternoon, but by Thursday afternoon it had rebounded, trading at 78.09 per dollar.	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	3	3	3	2	1	2	3	4
324	japan-tsunami-debris-turns-hawaii-170736829	A barnacle-covered seafood storage bin has been identified as the first piece of debris to arrive in Hawaii from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.The blue cubed bin, about 4 feet (1.2 meters) on each side, was spotted floating off the coast of Waimanalo, Oahu, last week and was towed ashore by marine officials, according to a statement from Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR).Officials said the plastic container belongs to Japanese seafood company Y.K. Suisan, Co., Ltd., based in the Miyagi prefecture, a region hit hard by the earthquake-triggered tsunami. As the disaster also set off a nuclear crisis with a partial meltdown at Japan's Fukushima power plant, health officials tested the bin for radiation but did not find any abnormal levels.The bin was housing gooseneck barnacles and crabs that typically live on floating debris in the open ocean. Officials said the organisms are not invasive to Hawaii. A few dead birds also were found inside the container.The Japanese government has estimated that the tsunami swept about 5 million tons of wreckage out to sea. Seventy percent of this debris is believed to have sunk offshore, but no one knows how much of the remaining 1.5 million tons are still floating in the Pacific Ocean.A handful of these lost parts have already turned up on or near the west coast of North America, from a small boat that washed up on a remote island in British Columbia to a large Japanese fishing ship that officials had to sink off the coast of Alaska.Follow LiveScience on Twitter @livescience.

326	jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl	FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — Darrelle Revis is back in action for the New York Jets.The All-Pro cornerback was cleared Thursday for contact in practice for the first time since suffering a concussion in the team's season opener. And, as far as Revis is concerned, there's no doubt whether he'll be on the field against the Dolphins in Miami."I'm playing," Revis said after practice. "The doctors cleared me, so I'll be playing Sunday."He has no more restrictions, and just to show how ready he is, Revis jokingly added: "I can bang my head on a wall if I want to."Coach Rex Ryan was also optimistic about Revis' chances of playing Sunday, but said before practice that he'll lean on the team's doctors before saying the cornerback will definitely be on the field in Miami."If it's not the final hurdle, I don't want to be saying something that isn't true," Ryan said. "Hopefully he'll play, but I guess we'll see."Revis practiced fully Thursday after passing all required tests. He needed to be cleared by the team physician and an independent neurologist to participate in contact drills. Revis was injured Sept. 9 against Buffalo when he was accidentally kicked in the head by teammate Bart Scott while attempting a tackle.The cornerback said he didn't need to be re-evaluated after practice anymore since he was cleared medically, so barring a setback, Revis will be back in the Jets' secondary on Sunday."I think you feel good when you have the best player on the field," Ryan said. "That can't hurt you. ... There's only one Darrelle Revis. I know I feel great about it. It's hard not to smile if he's out there. You feel great as a playcaller."And it comes at a good time for the Jets (1-1), who take on the AFC East-rival Dolphins (1-1) in a game with some early importance."This is a must-win for us," Revis said. "We need this win. The expectations are high for us to go down there and get a win Sunday."Revis didn't travel with the Steelers for the game in Pittsburgh after not being cleared for contact late last week. He said he felt as though he were in "a fog" right after he was injured, but progressively felt better."Today, it felt good," Revis said. "I actually got a couple jams in on press (coverage) and got physical with some guys. Contact actually felt good today, hitting guys and guys were hitting me back."Revis added that he felt pretty good Wednesday, too, and told the trainers that he didn't want to wear the red non-contact jersey in practice.His presence will be a big boost to the Jets' defense, which received solid play from Kyle Wilson in his place, but Revis is considered by many to be the best player in the league at his position."I'm definitely happy that he's cleared for contact," Ryan said. "Without question, I'm happy about that, for his sake. He loves to play, but if he's healthy, I think that's the big thing. As a coach, having probably, if he's not the premier defensive player in the league, he's certainly up there, so having him as a player, obviously, you're happy for that also."Without Revis on the field, the Jets allowed Ben Roethlisberger to throw for 275 yards and two touchdowns. He also had a passer rating of 125.1."I'm just one guy," Revis said. "I'm just happy to be back."The challenge this week for the Jets will be defending do-it-all running back Reggie Bush, but having Revis in the lineup will help them try to shut down the Dolphins' receivers and force rookie Ryan Tannehill into making mistakes."Having a special player like Darrelle, we ask him to do a lot of different things," Ryan said. "A lot of times, we put him one-on-one with a guy, on a team's best receiver and roll coverage away from him. He's just that kind of guy."Tight end Dustin Keller (right hamstring) and safety Eric Smith (hip/knee) were upgraded Thursday to limited after not practicing Wednesday.Getting Keller back would also be a big help to the offense, which struggled last week without the tight end on the field. Keller injured his right hamstring in the Jets' second preseason game against Carolina, and then tweaked it again during practice last Wednesday."We'll see how he goes through practice today, but it's much better than yesterday when he was out," Ryan said. "Hopefully, that is a sign that he'll play this week."Fullback John Conner (right knee), linebacker Bryan Thomas (hamstring), defensive back Ellis Lankster (lower back) and safety LaRon Landry (heel) didn't practice — although Landry's absence was expected. The team gives him one day off from practice each week to reduce wear and tear on his heel, which caused him to miss the end of last season with the Washington Redskins.___NOTES: Landry was called for a personal foul for a late hit last week and another for a horse-collar tackle, but Ryan enjoys the safety's aggressive style. "I love the fact he has a reputation as a huge hitter because he's clean," the coach said. "There isn't anybody saying he's not a clean player. He's a clean player. He's a hitter." Landry won't slow down or change the way he plays, either. "When I'm in the game, I'm not thinking about a penalty I'm about to have or anything like that," he said. "I'm just playing a play to win and do anything to help my team out." ... ST coordinator Mike Westhoff has said this will be his 30th and final year coaching in the NFL, and he hasn't reconsidered at any point so far. "I don't close doors, but I think I just made a decision that this would be enough and the time to maybe look at something else," Westhoff said.	2	3	3	2	3	4	3	2	3	3	4	4	3	2	3	4

I don't call that dependency. I call that ingratitude to not recognize they are a part of that 47 percent," Biden said on the steps of the state house in Concord, N.H.Following the event, a Biden aide clarified Biden intended to say there are approximately 68,000 troops left in Afghanistan.On Thursday, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced the last of 33,000 surge troops had left Afghanistan.President Obama announced the temporary surge of troops in Afghanistan, which would include the deployment of 33,000 troops, two years ago.	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	3	3	1	2	3	4

330	katie-couric-opens-battling-bulimia-194848745	NEW YORK (AP) — Viewers of Katie Couric's talk show were doubtless surprised on Monday when, during the discussion of eating disorders, Couric disclosed that she had had her own struggles with that cruel, sometimes deadly condition."I wrestled with bulimia all through college and for two years after that," she said, describing the guilt she felt at eating a single cookie or chewing a stick of gum that wasn't sugar-free.But the bulk of the show was devoted to her guests, who included experts on the subject as well as its sufferers, notably singer and new "X Factor" judge Demi Lovato.During the hour, Couric said little more about her experience, which she had never before made public."I kind of hesitated to even bring it up," she told The Associated Press after the taping. "But I felt that if I expect people on my show to be honest, then, when relevant, I owe it to people watching to be honest myself."I wanted to focus on my guests," she said, "while acknowledging one of the reasons this issue is so important to me: I went through it."It's all part of a balance Couric is striving for on her new syndicated daytime show, "Katie," between sharing her experiences and turning her show into a personal confessional.But in an exclusive interview with the AP, Couric, 55, shared details about the illness that first plagued her as a senior at Yorktown High School in Arlington, Va.It began, she said, when she learned she had been turned down by the college she most wanted to attend.Couric was a likely candidate for an eating disorder."Like a lot of young women, I was struggling with my body image," she said, "and feeling like I wasn't good enough or attractive enough or thin enough."She termed her figure at the time as "curvy," and not the cultural ideal, which she identified as "five-foot-eight and weighing 115 pounds. It can be so difficult to embrace the body that you have if it doesn't fit with the ideal. Women get praised for being super-thin, so you keep striving to be that way."She said her disorder "ebbed and flowed" through the years."Some periods were worse than others, when I was binging and purging a lot," she said. "I'd have a piece of gum that wasn't sugarless and then say, 'Oh! I've been bad,' and then feel so terrible that I would eat and throw up. It was awful."But what I'm describing is something so many people have gone through or are going through," she noted, "and it's so damaging, both psychically and physically."Couric attended the University of Virginia, then landed her first job at the ABC News bureau in Washington, D.C. And even then, she was waging a battle with food.With the help of a therapist, she had a grip on her condition by her early 20s, though "it didn't mean that I didn't still have issues and feel bad about myself."But since then, she said, "I've learned how to have a much healthier relationship with food, and how to enjoy my life without obsessing about food."She said she was glad she had shared with viewers her ordeal with bulimia, "because it's so commonplace."And it's not the first time Couric has let the public in on a personal ordeal. Her audience shared her pain from the death of her husband, Jay Monahan, of colon cancer in 1998. The tragedy led Couric, then a co-anchor of "Today," to become an advocate for colon cancer awareness and for colonoscopies. In 2000, she underwent a colonoscopy on the air."The educational aspect far outweighed any personal embarrassment I might have felt," she explained. "I had just lost my husband at 42 to this No. 2 cancer killer of men and women. I had a bully pulpit from which I could implore people to take steps that could potentially save their lives. It was a no-brainer."In the future, viewers of "Katie" can expect her to confide in them again when it feels right."I don't think there are any huge revelations about myself that need to be shared or would be appropriate to share," she said. "But I'm trying to strike the right balance of talking about my situation, but not focusing on it so much that I'm being put on the couch."___Online:http://www.katiecouric.com___EDITOR'S NOTE — Frazier Moore is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

332	kenya-navy-shells-somali-town-rebels-announce-retreat-120839530	MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Kenyan warships shelled the southern Somali port of Kismayu overnight after al Qaeda-linked rebels said they had abandoned the city, residents said on Sunday.Stunned by an assault by sea, air and ground forces late on Friday night, al Shabaab rebels fled the city that had been their key source of revenue, retreating to surrounding forests and towns.The shells may have been targeting any remaining pockets of resistance or military installations in the city that was the rebels' last stronghold."The ships were firing deafening shells to the outskirts last night but several shells landed on houses," said Samira Ismail, a local mother of four.Al Shabaab said two children were killed and other people injured by the shells, a statement rejected as propaganda by Kenyan military spokesman Col. Cyrus Oguna.Kenyan and Somali troops sent to retake Kismayu from the rebels were still in the town's outskirts, Oguna said, proceeding carefully in case al Shabaab's claim that it had abandoned the city was a ploy to lure them into a trap."The troops are consolidating and making plans to expand into the southern part of the city," Oguna told Reuters."A lot of caution must be exercised here. We don't want to get into a situation where we start to lose troops here and there."The southern part is the city center and whoever wins it will effectively have control over the port and other strategic installations.The Kenya Defence Force and the Somalia National Army, fighting under the flag of the African Union force in Somalia (AMISOM), have not suffered any casualties in the operation, Oguna said.An al Shabaab official said that although the group had ceded control of Kismayu, its fighters were poised to engage the allied troops once they enter the city."We are just waiting for the AU and Somali troops to enter the town. We shall fight them in streets and alleys. We abandoned the town. Why don't they go in if they have the guts?" Sheikh Hudayfa Abdirahman, the group's head of Jubba region, told Reuters.In Kenya's capital Nairobi, a nine-year-old boy was killed and three children wounded by a hand grenade thrown into a Sunday school session in a church on Sunday, an act police said was the work of al Shabaab sympathizers."FIGHT THE ENEMIES IN MUDDY JUNGLES"Somalia analysts said although al Shabaab had retreated, it was far from vanquished.The rebel group, which counts foreign al Qaeda-trained fighters among its ranks, is seen as one of the biggest threats to stability in the Horn of Africa. It has received advice from al Qaeda's leadership, counter-terrorism experts say.The insurgents, who once controlled swathes of the lawless Horn of Africa country, have turned to guerrilla tactics, harrying the weak government of newly-elected President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud with suicide bombings and assassinations.Abdirahman said the onset of rains would help al Shabaab fight back."We shall fight the enemies in the muddy jungles between Kismayu and Kenya. Enemies will be stuck in the mud. We are sure the enemies will never rule peacefully," he said.Kismayu residents said the chaos was causing hardships."Food prices and dollar value have risen a bit this morning. If the situation remains this way for days, we anticipate inflation and then starvation," said shopkeeper Abdullahi Nur.Some civilians fled the city in minibuses on rough roads that twist through the surrounding jungles."I will also evacuate my children if Kismayu does not change positively," said Ismail, the mother of four.(Additional reporting and writing by Duncan Miriri in Nairobi; Editing by Robin Pomeroy)	2	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	2	4	2	2	4	3	
333	kenyan-shilling-steady-vs-dollar-eyes-inflation-094749348--business	NAIROBI (Reuters) - The Kenyan shilling was steady against the dollar but could come under pressure if figures due Friday show inflation is still falling, which could drag down investor returns from government bonds.Typically, lower inflation cause yields on government securities to be cut and interest rates to be lowered, which make it cheaper for importers to access credit and commercial banks to hold long dollar position, weighing on the shilling."We are watching out to see where inflation will come in," said Dickson Magecha, a trader at Standard Chartered Bank.At 0832 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 85.20/40 versus the dollar, barely changed from Thursday's close of 85.25/45.Inflation in the east African nation soared last year to peak at nearly 20 percent in November, due to a widening fuel import bill and drought, which dragged the shilling through a series of record lows.A tight monetary policy adopted by policymakers in the fourth quarter of 2011 helped bring down inflation for nine straight months and stabilised the foreign exchange rate.Policymakers embarked on an easing cycle in July, slashing the benchmark central bank rate by a total 500 basis points in two meetings to 13 percent, in order to support economic growth.A Reuters poll of 11 analysts showed that year-on-year inflation could fall to 5.40 percent in September from 6.09 percent in August.Traders said the shilling could come under pressure from last minute end-month importers demand for the dollar and banks piling on greenbacks in anticipation that lower inflation in September could give room for a further cut in rates by the central bank."We expect to see a bit of weakening due to energy flows. We could touch 85.50 by the close of the day," Magecha said.	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	2	3	2	2	2	2	3	3

New research, published in BioMed Central's open access journal BMC Medicine, finds that the fat surrounding the prostate of overweight or obese men with prostate cancer provides a favorable environment to promote cancer growth.”While they note that fat “is a major player in the immune system, which protects the body from infection and disease,” the bad news is that “too much fat can cause these systems to go haywire and can increase the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.”MORE: Facebook-ing Away the Pounds: Social Media Promotes Weight LossAnd this new research shows that, “Regardless of type of prostate disease the overweight men had different levels of gene activity in the fat surrounding their prostates compared to the lean men.”To put things in perspective, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) says that in “One study, using NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, estimated that in 2007 in the United States, about 34,000 new cases of cancer in men (4 percent) and 50,500 in women (7 percent) were due to obesity. The percentage of cases attributed to obesity varied widely for different cancer types but was as high as 40 percent for some cancers, particularly endometrial cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma.”Earlier this year, the journal Science observed that, “Insulin and a related hormone known as insulin-like growth factor (IGF) are now at the center of a growing wave of research around the world aimed at elucidating what many scientists consider to be their critical role in fueling a wide range of cancers. Elevated levels of insulin and IGF are also the leading candidates to explain a significant correlation in epidemiology that has gained attention over the past 30 years: Obese and diabetic individuals have a far higher risk than lean healthy people of getting cancer, and when they do get it, their risk of dying from it is greater.”Furthermore, in March, USA Today reported, “Although the overall rate of new cancer cases is declining . . . excess weight and a sedentary lifestyle are risk factors for one-quarter to one-third of common cancers in the USA. About one-third of adults—almost 78 million—are obese, roughly 30 or more pounds over a healthy weight."They go on to quote physician Marcus Plescia, director of the division of cancer prevention for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who said, "I don't think Americans understand the association between cancer and obesity . . . We do know people are afraid of cancer. They know about the links (from obesity) to diabetes, heart disease and arthritis, but many don't know about this. They need to know."Consider yourself warned.Are these findings likely to make you more aware of the dangers of being overweight and cause changes in your behavior if you find you’re putting on the pounds?Lawrence Karol is a writer and editor who lives with his dog, Mike.

335	knowing-neil-armstrong-one-giant-leap-apollo-fanatic-122037818	As the nation bid farewell to Neil Armstrong earlier this month, my wife and I sat in the stone-and-stained-glass grandeur of the National Cathedral listening to appreciations of history’s first moonwalker. For me it was the end of a journey that had begun more than four decades earlier, even before Armstrong took his “one small step” onto the Sea of Tranquillity, during the summer I turned 13.Watching him on TV at the Apollo 11 pre-flight press conference in 1969 I sensed something special about him, a thoughtful, articulate nature that seemed to set him apart even from other astronauts. He quickly became for me a hero among heroes, a kind of superman. And yet, I heard him say before and after Apollo 11 that he was not unique, not deserving of special praise, a message I managed to absorb even as I idolized him. I’d already been lucky enough to meet several Apollo astronauts, but now, as a full-fledged Apollo fanatic, meeting Neil Armstrong became one of my fondest hopes—not quite an obsession, but close.Two years later, in September 1971, on a sightseeing trip to Washington D.C., with my parents, I dragged them to NASA Headquarters. There I learned that Armstrong, no longer an active astronaut, actually had his office in that building. I could hardly believe what I was hearing. In that moment, the rest of the world fell away, and I had a mission. The next morning, despite my mother’s skepticism ("You can’t just go down there and meet Neil Armstrong!"), I took a taxi by myself back to NASA. [Photos: Neil Armstrong Remembered]Making my way down the long corridor to Armstrong’s office, barely containing my excitement, I reached my goal only to be told by his secretary that he wouldn’t be in that day. Dejected, I headed back toward the elevators. But then, as I looked up, my gloom vanished: there was Armstrong, carrying his briefcase, walking toward me. I told him, "I'm about as interested in space as you can get."Minutes later, I had the autograph I had longed for, but there was one more thing I had to have: A photo. I had brought along my dad’s little Minox camera, but there was no one else in the hallway where we stood. Armstrong offered to take the picture himself, holding the Minox with one outstretched hand and pointing it back at us. And then, before we parted, I tried to communicate to him that I understood he was not a superman but a flesh-and-blood human being. Armstrong didn’t say anything in response.Looking back, I'm pretty sure he didn't know what to make of this 15-year-old who looked much younger, with a mop of hair, saying such things. But I was on a nirvana cloud. I had met my ultimate hero.Seventeen years later, in October 1988, I was once again face-to-face with Armstrong in Washington, this time to interview him for my book "A Man on the Moon." By now I knew only too well his reputation for reticence and his reluctance to grant interviews, but I had managed to win his cooperation. Still, I wasn’t sure what to expect from this encounter. Armstrong had warned me on the phone a couple of weeks earlier not to expect him to answer personal questions; he would only talk about "matters of fact."And yet, as the interview progressed, we connected. He answered my questions about Apollo 11 with intelligence and humor. When I asked about the experience of taking the first human footsteps on the moon, he surprised me by saying that for him, “The emotional moment was the landing. That was human contact with the moon… And the business of getting down the ladder, to me, was much less significant. You know, I wouldn't have focused on that at all except that the press and everyone was making so much of a big thing about the exit from the vehicle and step on the surface with the boot.”I shouldn’t have been surprised: Neil Armstrong was the essence of the engineering test pilot. And when I asked about the enormous role in which fate had placed him as the first human being to walk on another world, his answer revealed a man who saw himself in the broad sweep of human achievement. "I don't focus on self-satisfaction and being first," Armstrong told me. What mattered to him, he said, were the contributions he’d helped make to Apollo and the other programs he’d worked on, things that helped get humanity "to a new plateau to look from. That’s just the way I tend to look at things."Interviewing Neil Armstrong was one of the highpoints of my professional career. In the years that followed, I got an even greater gift, as he and I became friends. Anytime I saw him, whether at an Apollo anniversary event, in the SPACE.com boardroom, or even in a more private, social setting, I delighted in his warmth and humor. I valued his feedback on my work. And I cherished knowing a man who in every way lived up to the role in which fate placed him.Neil Armstrong went to the moon with the supreme self-confidence and skill necessary to carry out history’s ultimate test flight. When he returned, despite his innate shyness, he showed the strength of character to carry out the mission we gave him, one for which there could have been no adequate preparation: to be a world icon. Now that he is gone, I feel how blessed I am to have known him, and how lucky we all were to have experienced this singular human being, ideally suited for a singular place in history.Space journalist Andrew Chaikin is an Apollo historian and author of "Man on the Moon," "A Passion for Mars" and co-author (with Victoria Kohl) of "Voices From the Moon" and the children's book "Mission Control, This is Apollo."

338	labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Orchestra was called the world's greatest not long ago, welcome recognition for musicians outside a top cultural center. Now its members are locked out of Orchestra Hall, stuck in the same kind of labor-management battle recently afflicting teachers and football referees.Across the country, symphony and chamber orchestra executives have cited flat ticket sales and slumping private support as they seek major pay concessions from musicians, who warn about a loss of talent and reputation. In Minneapolis, the Minnesota Orchestra has already cancelled concerts through Nov. 25 as negotiators argue over a proposal to trim the average musicians' salary by $46,000 a year.A similar standoff is underway across the Mississippi River at the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. The Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra has canceled the first month of its season in a labor impasse, and labor troubles are also rumbling at orchestras in Richmond, Va., Jacksonville, Fla., and San Antonio, Texas."It breaks my heart," said Christal Steele, a violinist and assistant concertmaster in Indianapolis, where she and fellow musicians have gone without pay and benefits for almost a month. "This is my 40th season, and in that time, I have seen nothing but this orchestra rise in quality and in stature. Now in one fell swoop, they're trying to erase the last 30 years."Last week, musicians and management at the symphony orchestras in both Chicago and Atlanta reached new contracts after contentious negotiations. Atlanta's musicians went without pay for a month before accepting $5.2 million in compensation cuts over two years, plus reductions in their ranks. The Chicago deal came after a two-day strike that forced the cancellations of the season's first Saturday night show, with musicians wrangling salary increases but agreeing to pay higher health care costs."It's shaking up a lot of organizations right now," said Drew McManus, a Chicago-based consultant to orchestras and other arts organizations. "This world of orchestras is one that's always been defined by well-established strata — the best orchestras in the country, the second tier and so on — and that is very much in flux at the moment."The Minnesota Orchestra has seen its reputation grow in recent years under conductor Osmo Vanska. The Finnish-born Vanska has become something of a celebrity in a state that treasures its Scandinavian heritage, and he's won international acclaim for pushing the orchestra to new heights.After seeing the Minnesota Orchestra play at Carnegie Hall in 2010, The New Yorker's classical music critic Alex Ross wrote that they "sounded, to my ears, like the greatest orchestra in the world."But the orchestra's leaders have said even as its reputation grows they've seen flat attendance, declining corporate and individual support, and poor results from investments. Meanwhile, salaries grew by 3 to 4 percent annually under the previous contract."You couple that with one of the worst financial markets of the last 100 years, and obviously you have to reset our orchestra and our organization in terms of looking to a future that's sustainable," said Michael Henson, the orchestra's president. He said the orchestra has been forced to draw too deeply from its endowment to stay in the black."A very significant part of our expenses are musicians' salaries, and that's a logical area for us to address to find a solution for long-term stability," Henson said. Management's proposal would trim average annual salaries for orchestra members from $135,000 to $89,000.Doug Wright, the Minnesota Orchestra's principal trombonist and a member of the musicians' negotiating team, said the wages reflect the skill involved in reaching the top level and big salary cuts would result in a loss of talent."The musicians of a major American symphony orchestra live in a global marketplace," Wright said. "And if we're going to continue to attract and retain the best of the best, our competition is not, you know, the local marching band. Our competition is Boston, Chicago, L.A., San Francisco."McManus, the arts consultant, said the Detroit Symphony Orchestra took a big blow to its reputation after a six-month musicians' strike in 2010, during which many musicians quit.Musicians have demanded an open audit of the orchestras' finances, complaining about a $50 million renovation of Orchestra Hall's lobby now underway. Henson said renovation funds come from dedicated donations and are needed to keep drawing audiences and big donors.Jesse Stone, president and chief executive officer of the League of American Orchestras, which doesn't take sides in labor-management disputes, said orchestras are struggling with the economy like many other businesses that depend on discretionary spending."These are big cultural trends that are affecting the movie business, and professional sports, and the way our culture operates now," he said. "So it's not surprising that we're likely to see a period of visible experimentation in American orchestras and the way they operate."	4	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	4
339	langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - 'Home cooking' has helped the United States win the Ryder Cup all but three times on American soil but former captain Bernhard Langer has already proved once that he has the recipe for European success.Eight years ago, Langer led Europe to a record victory by 18-1/2 points to 9-1/2 at Oakland Hills and the meticulous German believes his continent can triumph again this week by using a similarly subtle mix of various ingredients.Though Langer believes home advantage will give the U.S. a slight edge over holders Europe at Medinah Country Club, he expects the winning margin to be wafer thin, whichever team prevails."There are lots of little things a captain can do that could have an influence positively or negatively on a Ryder Cup," the twice Masters champion told Reuters on Wednesday a short distance from 18th green on Medinah's No. 3 Course."If you can put a lot of the right pieces together, the puzzle looks a lot better than when you mess up a few pieces and it looks like a painting."Asked what advice he would give to European captain Jose Maria Olazabal for this week's showdown, Langer replied: "To communicate well to his players, to keep them happy, especially those guys who are not playing."He has to figure out his best players on the course and if he puts someone out and if he is not confident enough or not playing well, he needs to give him a rest, give him a chance to work out his game or his putting stroke or whatever it is and hope he will be ready for the singles."If he has someone who is hot, let him play. Get out there and make more points. Find out who is comfortable with this golf course and with the speed of the greens and figure out who might not be comfortable."The fact that four players have to sit out each of the foursomes and fourballs sessions on the Friday and Saturday gives the captain a public relations headache, according to Langer."Those guys sitting out are not going to be happy," said the German, a veteran of 10 Ryder Cups as player. "I was never happy sitting out and I am sure no one is ever happy."They are all thinking, 'Why me? Am I not good enough?' So you've got to make sure that you explain to them what you're thinking is and that everybody is going to play before Sunday which I think is vital."You don't want to hold anyone back the whole week and then send them out cold on Sunday. Tell them we are all part of the same team and we are going to pull on the same strings."CLOSE CONTESTLanger, who won his two Green Jackets at the Masters in 1985 and 1993, predicted that this week's Ryder Cup would be a very close contest."The teams are very evenly matched, although the Americans are the favourites playing at home," the 55-year-old said. "The golf course is set up a little different than most golf courses with no rough which is unheard of nowadays."I guess captain Davis Love must have put some thought into that because he can set up the golf course any which way he feels benefits his players so we will see how that will play out."I know the Americans have some big bombers in there but we have a couple ourselves that hit it pretty far so I don't see a real advantage on either side."Langer, an official patron of the Ryder Cup who is a global ambassador for Mercedes-Benz, said home advantage at a Ryder Cup related to the crowd atmosphere and not to the course."It's more about being comfortable with the whole environment," he added. "The crowd is either for you or against you and that plays with your emotions, it plays with the whole atmosphere."It is, in a sense, very hostile to the visiting nation and advantageous for the home team. It's unique when you're out there. It starts from the very first shot to the very last shot you're going to hit."(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes; Editing by Frank Pingue)	3	3	2	4	3	4	2	3	3	2	2	3	2	2	2	4
340	large-part-ancient-souk-syrias-aleppo-ashes-activists-150936076	BEIRUT (Reuters) - Large parts of Aleppo's covered market, the largest of its kind in the world and a UNESCO world heritage site that traces its history back to the 14th century, have been reduced to ashes as government forces and rebels fight for control of the city.The historic market was largely undamaged by earlier fighting in Syria's largest city, but in the early hours of Saturday some of its shops caught fire during clashes in circumstances that remain unclear.The flames spread rapidly, partly because many of the small retail units tucked beneath the market's ancient arches were full of fabric, and have now ravaged at least 1,500 shops and are still burning, activists said."It is not only the souk that is burning, my heart is burning as well," said an anti-government activist called Hashem who learnt the craft of jewelry-making in the souk before the revolt against President Bashar al-Assad erupted last year.The souk's devastation is a reminder of how the 18-month-old conflict - in which both sides are struggling to gain the upper hand and activists estimate 30,000 people have been killed - is destroying Syria's rich cultural and historical legacy as well as the lives of its 22.5 million people.Aleppo's old city is one of several places that UNESCO, the United Nations cultural agency, has designated world heritage sites and which are now at risk.UNESCO believes that five of Syria's six world heritage sites have already been damaged. Other heritage sites include the ancient desert city of Palmyra, the Crac des Chevaliers crusader fortress and parts of old Damascus.It was not immediately clear how the fire in the market started but activists accused government forces of using incendiary bullets to attack rebels who had taken up positions there after launching a new offensive in the city on Thursday."The fighters tried to put out the fire but failed to do so because snipers were shooting at them," another activist said."The fire is still raging and at least 1,500 shops have now been burnt down."The market - Souk al-Madina - comprises a network of vaulted stone alleyways and carved wooden facades and was once a major tourist attraction and a busy cosmopolitan trading hub on the ancient Silk Road from China.Its many narrow alleys have a combined length of 13 km (8 miles) making it the largest covered market in the world and it sells everything from soap to jewelry to clothing.ANGER TOWARDS THE REBELSActivists said they were working to try to document the scale of the damage, which it is estimated it will cost millions of dollars to repair.Some anti-government activists have privately expressed anger towards their own fighters for taking up positions in the old city. "We all know that this is a criminal regime and it will do anything," said one activist who declined to be named. "That is why the fighters had no business being in the souk. Why did they go there?"But other activists defended the rebels' behavior."The fire spread as far as the Umayyad Mosque, the fighters who managed to stop it from spreading even further," an activist from the city called Yasser said."For all those asking why the fighters are in the Old City, we say we have only entered to liberate it"Rebels said they were involved in heavy clashes in Aleppo on Sunday, saying they had attacked the Neirab military air base. They also reported fighting in Arkoub, east of the city.The failure of either side to break the military deadlock is reflected diplomatically, with foreign powers divided over how to act. Western states and Gulf Arab countries back the opposition but most seem reluctant to interfere, while Russia, China and Iran back Assad.Speaking to a conference of the ruling AK party in Turkey, Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi - who has said he opposes military intervention in Syria - said he favored a diplomatic solution facilitated by the Arab League, the United Nations and individual countries across the world.He said the Syrian people were being "butchered and killed day and night" and that he fully backed their struggle to overthrow Assad."We will not be calm, we will not settle down until this bloodshed stops and until the will of the Syrian people to choose their own leader is realized and until this current oppressive leadership disappears," he said."This oppressive regime is spilling the people's blood and the Syrian people must gain full liberty."Activists reported fresh clashes in Damascus suburbs on Sunday and at least eight bodies were reported to have been found in the northern suburb of Barzeh. Clashes were also reported to have erupted in some parts of Homs city.Syrian state television said a suicide bomber had killed at least four people in the northern city of Qamishli. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least eight members of the security forces had been killed in the explosion which it said targeted a police station.(Additional reporting by Marwa Awad in Cairo; Editing by Andrew Osborn)	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	2	4	2	1	2	4	4
341	last-hurrah-50th-york-film-festival-144142164	NEW YORK (AP) — When the playwright Tony Kushner recently grabbed a microphone and sat down for a post-screening Q&A with a filmmaker and the film's cast, he mumbled that he felt like Richard Pena.So central has Pena been to film in New York over the last 25 years that for many merely sitting in front of a movie screen here is likely to bring him to mind. As the programming director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and chairman of the New York Film Festival selection committee, he's one of the city's most devoted advocates of global cinema.This year's New York Film Festival, the 50th, is also Pena's last. After 25 years, Pena is retiring at the end of the year."I'd be really pleased to be known as the person who kept the — what I think — extremely high level of the festival constant," Pena said in a recent interview in Lincoln Center's Walter Reade Theater. "That indeed I was given a trust in 1988 and I didn't screw up."Most would give him far more credit than that. Pena has overseen film at Lincoln Center through a tumultuous period that's seen the graying of art house audiences, the birth of digital filmmaking and distribution, the exponential growth of film festivals and the shift of the art film's epicenter away from Europe and toward the Middle East, Asia and South America.It hasn't always been easy — critics have claimed narrowing relevancy for the NYFF — but most see in "The Festival" an exalted, uncorrupted platform of some of the best in movies. When the 50th NYFF begins Friday, it will be much how it's always been: a carefully curated, highly-selective few dozen films from around the world, including choice offerings from international festivals and highly anticipated fall films from Hollywood.The premiere of Ang Lee's "Life of Pi," a 3-D adaptation of the fantastical bestseller, opens the festival. "Sopranos" creator David Chase's directorial debut, "Not Fade Away," is the midway centerpiece. And the Robert Zemeckis drama "Flight," starring Denzel Washington, will close the fest.The rest of the 32 movies in the main slate include films from Noah Baumbach ("Frances Ha"), Brian De Palma ("Passion"), Olivier Assayas ("Something in the Air"), Michael Haneke ("Amour," the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes), Cristian Mungiu ("Beyond the Hills") and Abbas Kiarostami ("Like Someone in Love").This year's festival promises to be a milestone, celebrating the NYFF's past and its future. Along with various 50th anniversary celebrations, Pena will be feted in one of two galas (the other is for Nicole Kidman, star of Lee Daniels' "The Paperboy," an entry in the main slate). But the festival has also responded to a changing landscape by expanding: A three-screen theater opened last year, allowing the Film Society to broaden its offerings and add some less stuffy events, like a reunion of the cast of Rob Reiner's 1987 comedy classic, "The Princess Bride."The 59-year-old Pena, who also teaches film at Columbia University, has seen the passion that accompanied the art house of the '60s — when films by Godard, Truffaut, Antonioni were met with fervor — wane: "Something happened along the way there and I don't really know what it was."In festival programs and retrospectives, Pena has sought to expand the horizons of contemporary cinephilia, trumpeting directors like Kiarostami, Pedro Almodovar, the Dardenne brothers, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Chao-sheng and Edward Yang."In terms of international cinema, I would love to take a bow for that," says Pena. "But on the other hand, you have to realize, I had much greater access to that kind of work than my predecessors did. I mean, VHS tape was invented in 1985 and I came in 1988."Rose Kuo, executive director of the Film Society, says Pena "very much took a lead" in bringing foreign films to Americans."When everybody else was looking right, he decided to look left and search out what other regions were producing interesting work," says Kuo.Fittingly, the first festival Pena oversaw opened with Almodovar's "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown." The Spanish director has since been a regular at the festival. In a book planned for release this fall on the festival, Almodovar writes of the resonance of the festival and its director: "At that moment I initiated a dialogue with New York City and its cinephiles that has only increased in intensity, fun, variety and passion."It was Koch, the longtime administrator of the Film Society, who hired Pena, formerly the program director at the Art Institute of Chicago. His arrival, initially in a lesser role, was promptly expanded in wake of the acrimonious exit of Richard Roud, who had been program director for the festival's first 25 years and was also hired at age 34."Things were simpler in those times and in hiring Richard, I believe I made the most important decision of my 32 years as administrator of the Film Society," says Koch. "After the first year, I knew he would make it to 25 — and probably another 25, if he wanted to work 24/7 a few more decades."Pena will be succeeded by not one but two: Programmer and sometimes documentarian Kent Jones will be director of programming of the festival, and critic Robert Koehler will be director of programming year-round for the Film Society.With three kids ranging in age from 15-24, Pena says he's "winding down a bit" and will likely occupy himself by organizing smaller programs here and there and doing series of lectures."I always think that there's stuff out there," he says of film. "If you're willing to move a little bit and make a tiny bit of effort, you can discover all kinds of wonderful things."___Online:http://www.filmlinc.com/nyff2012	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	2	3	2	4

344	led-zeppelin-dodges-reunion-issue-film-promotion-165625765	LONDON (Reuters) - The surviving members of British rock band Led Zeppelin on Friday sidestepped the question of whether they would perform together again, and the closest their legions of fans may get is a film of their last concert in 2007.The group that brought the world tracks like "Whole Lotta Love", "Kashmir" and "Stairway to Heaven" reunited five years ago at London's O2 Arena for a tribute gig to Ahmet Ertegun, the founder of Atlantic Records which signed Led Zeppelin in 1968.It was one of the few times the band performed together since breaking up following the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980, and sparked frenzied speculation that a lucrative reunion tour could be on the cards.That has failed to materialize, and at a press conference to promote the new video of the 2007 gig, called "Celebration Day", lead singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page and bass/keyboard player John Paul Jones all refused to be drawn on future plans.Asked whether they might consider reuniting, Page, considered one of the greatest guitarists in rock history, replied: "Can I ask you a question? You've all been to see the film. Did you enjoy it?"From a mostly partisan crowd of journalists and fans, the answer was in the affirmative. "Then we've done our job," added the silver-haired 68-year-old.When a reporter called out would Led Zeppelin "do it again", Plant simply replied: "With you?"Their non-committal answers will mean the guessing game over one of the most eagerly awaited reunions in rock is likely to continue for some time to come.Celebration Day, directed by Dick Carruthers, is a two-hour film featuring all 16 tracks of the band's tribute gig, starting with "Good Times Bad Times", taking in "Dazed and Confused" and "Whole Lotta Love" and concluding with "Rock and Roll".When tickets went on sale, an estimated 20 million people applied for 18,000 places, underlining the level of pressure the band has come under to play together more regularly."HE DROVE US"On drums in the place of Bonham was his son Jason, a musician in his own right, who was praised by Plant and Page."It was appropriate and it was wonderful and also his vigor was so fantastic too," said Plant. "He drove us, you know. It was peculiar and strange at times, but at the same time it was very rewarding for all of us."Plant recalled playing with Jason Bonham previously."We played with him before at his wedding," he said. "Sadly he decided to go to bed during the wedding reception, and because I was ... a friend of the family from way back I was the one who had to go up to his room and get him to get out of bed."The long-haired lead singer admitted he had been reluctant to perform Stairway to Heaven, one of Led Zeppelin's most popular tracks, and arguably its most obscure in terms of the meaning of the lyrics."I struggle with some of the lyrics from particular periods of time," he explained. "May be I was still trying to work out what I was talking about ... Every other fucker is."All three band members expressed a sense of relief when the O2 concert was over."Everybody's eyes are on us waiting for it to go not so much right as wrong," said Plant, adding that the band hugged each other when the concert was over.Page recalled a "massive" party after the show, but the group itself "sort of disappeared into the ether."He added that "there might have been a handful of fixes" to the sound in the film. "The concert was what it was," said Page. "There was very little that needed to be messed about with because we'd really done it well in the first place."Jones, a man of few words when it comes to the press, was asked why Led Zeppelin had taken five years to produce a movie based on the concert."Five years is like five minutes in Zeppelin time," he said.* Celebration Day will be shown at select movie theatres on October 17 and is available in video and audio format on November 19.(Reporting by Mike Collett-White, editing by Paul Casciato)	3	4	3	3	4	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	2	1	3	4
345	libyans-hand-over-weapons-arms-collection-drive-203759894	TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Hundreds of Libyans handed in weapons left over from last year's war on Saturday, part of a drive by the North African country to rid its streets of arms and crack down on rogue militia groups.As the day went on, a trickle of people turned into longer lines in Tripoli and in the eastern city of Benghazi, where tents were set up in squares for military officials to collect arms, explosives and even rocket propelled grenade launchers.Amid a celebratory atmosphere, women and children looked on as men queued to turn over their weapons as they listened to a military marching band and pop music."We want our country to be safe and secure ... We don't want to see weapons anymore," Tripoli resident Mohammed Salama said, as he stood in line to hand over a rifle."We want to live our lives. The time of war is over."Libya's new rulers have struggled to impose their authority on a country awash with weapons, and many Libyans are fed up with militias, formed during the war but which still patrol the streets and often take the law into their own hands.A September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, in which the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed, was followed by anti-militia protests in the city last week, increasing pressure on the authorities to tackle insecurity.The government has since taken a twin-track approach - vowing to dissolve rogue militias that operated without official government permission, but also offering public backing to many of the most powerful armed groups, which have official licenses to operate, as it seeks to build stronger security forces.Saad Bakar, head of a small brigade in Benghazi, handed over rifles and ammunition on Saturday, saying he was ready to disband his group."We were waiting until today to make sure that the weapons go to the right place," he said. "We want to join the army as individuals."STEP FORWARDIn Benghazi, an organizer said more than 800 people had been registered as having come to the collection point. In Tripoli, an army official did not give an exact figure but said the number had superseded expectations of around 200 people.One participant said he had even heard that a tank had been handed over.Those numbers suggest a fraction of the arms that spilled out of Muammar Gaddafi's arsenals have been handed over but the initiative is seen as a step forward in a country where many still keep their weapons citing a precarious security situation."I want to live in a peaceful place where only the police and army have arms," Benghazi businessman Ibrahim Ali said after handing over a machine gun.But he said he would still keep hold of his rifle for now. "When I can call the police and they are able to arrive quickly, then I can give them that weapon," he said.The collection drive is a collaboration between the army and a private television station which drummed up support through live broadcasts from Tripoli and Benghazi.Organizers in both cities, who said the event would be repeated in other cities, planned to raffle off prizes, including cars at the end of the day-long collection."Libyan people need stability ... They are handing over weapons to the military so that they are kept in the right place and not on the streets," said Yussef al-Mangoush, the army's chief-of-staff. "This is the beginning, we began this in Tripoli and Benghazi. We will go to other cities."Mohammed Arusi, a 58 year old engineer who was queuing to hand over a rifle in Tripoli, said he was satisfied the security situation was changing for the better."It's not like before, the army is getting stronger," he said. "You cannot buy safety, you have to feel safe. And I feel safe right now."

346	libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193	BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) — Hundreds of protesters stormed the compound of one of Libya's strongest armed Islamic extremist groups Friday, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building as the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador and four other Americans sparked a public backlash against armed groups that run rampant in the country and defy the country's new, post-Moammar Gadhafi leadership.Armed men at the administrative center for the Ansar al-Shariah militia, suspected to have led the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Benghazi consulate, first fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually withdrew from the site with their weapons and vehicles after it was surrounded by waves of protesters shouting "No to militias.""I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to see people in uniform," said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover, which protesters said was done in support of the army and police.No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi in a rally against armed militias. A vehicle was also burned at the compound, which was taken over by Libyan security forces after its occupants fled.For many Libyans, last week's attack on the U.S. Consulate in the eastern city of Benghazi was the last straw with one of the biggest problems Libya has faced since Gadhafi's ouster and death around a year ago — the multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the regular armed forces and police.The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Gadhafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals and carrying out killings. Militias made up of Islamic radicals are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar al-Shariah led the attack on the U.S. consulate.Some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar al-Shariah."No, no, to militias," the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. "Benghazi is in a trap," signs read. "Where is the army, where is the police?"Other signs mourned the killing of U.S. Amb. Chris Stevens, reading, "The ambassador was Libya's friend" and "Libya lost a friend." Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the protesters.Several thousand Ansar al-Shariah supporters lined up in front of their headquarters in the face of the crowd, waving black and white banners. There were some small scuffles, but mostly the two sides mingled and held discussions in the square.The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of Gadhafi in August 2011. The unprecedented public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.Residents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar al-Shariah and other militias.The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of Benghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Gadhafi era, it was the hotbed of a deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime. A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna. During the revolt against him last year, Gadhafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and ally itself with al-Qaida.But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city."The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous," said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio show he hosts. "We felt that the revolution is going in vain."Al-Shedwi said some were afraid that if they don't act to rein them in, the U.S. will strike against the militias, pushing people to support the gunmen.Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias disband. Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are killed.Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put an end to the "state of terrorism" created by the militias. At the city's main hotel, The Jewel of Darna, tribal figures, activists, local officials and lawmakers have been meeting in recent days to come up with a plan."Until when the tribes will remain silent," cried a bearded young man standing on a podium at one such meeting Thursday. "The militias don't recognize the state. The state is pampering them but this is not working anymore. You must act right now." Elders in traditional Libyan white robes stood up and shouted in support.Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked, reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and assassinations of former officers from Gadhafi's military.Darna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists. Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In the ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare Western songs.And many are impatient with Ansar al-Shariah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name means "Supporters of Shariah Law.""We are not infidels for God sake. We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street," said Wassam ben Madin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising against Gadhafi. "This is not the time for talk about Shariah. Have a state first then talk to me about Shariah.""If they are the 'supporters of Shariah' then who are we?" he said. "We don't want the flag of al-Qaida raised over heads," he added, referring to Ansar al-Shariah's black banner.One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Youssef, said, "We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell them you are from us and you fought for us" during the civil war against Gadahfi. But "if you say no (to integrating into the) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over."Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.So the government has created a "High Security Committee" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to integration. Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join — compared to the average police monthly salary of around $200. However, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only prompted more militias to form.Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war against Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several hundred thousand."All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming," said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. "The government is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster."	3	3	3	4	3	3	4	4	4	2	3	3	1	4	3	4
347	light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance	ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Light rainfall and abundant sunshine across most of Ivory Coast's main cocoa regions last week will encourage healthy output as the new harvesting season opens, farmers and analysts said on Tuesday.The main crop harvest in the world's top cocoa producer opens on October 1.While improved weather in recent weeks is helping to ease worries that outbreaks of fungal disease caused by poor conditions in July and August could affect production, fears that a sweeping reform of the sector may disrupt supply persist.Farmers said that most regions were primed for a healthy start to the season but continued rains and sunshine would be needed until November to ensure robust output through January.In the western region of Soubre, in the heart of the Ivorian cocoa belt, one analyst reported 9 millimetres of rainfall compared with 18mm the previous week."We're set to have lots of good quality cocoa for the first two months of the main crop," said Lazare Ake, who farms on the outskirts of Soubre."If we have good rains and lots of sunshine in October and until early November, we'll have an abundant harvest until January," he said.Similar growing conditions were reported in the western regions of Duekoue, Gagnoa and Meagui and in the southern regions of Divo and Agboville.In the western region of Daloa, responsible for a quarter of Ivory Coast's national output, farmers reported two good showers during the week."The flowers are still coming out. It's a good sign and that is encouraging going forward. Harvesting has started on most of the plantations and there are lots of ripe and nearly ripe pods on the trees," said local farmer Laurent Kouakou.In the southeastern region of Aboisso, farmers reported two light showers and abundant sunshine after two weeks without rain."More and more beans are being dried in the villages in the region. The harvest will be good, because there is now less black pod (disease)," said Aboisso farmer Etienne Yao.In the eastern region of Abengourou, one analyst reported 42mm of rains, which followed a week without showers."Looking at the trees, we don't think there will be a lot of cocoa in October, but there will be lots of beans in November and December," said farmer Marcellin N'Da.A sweeping reform of the top world grower's cocoa sector is meant to provide its farmers with a minimum price for their produce and is a key condition for debt relief under the IMF-World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) scheme - a vital part of its bid to rebuild after last year's post-election conflict.	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	1	3	3

349	lindsay-lohan-scuffles-man-york-hotel-012407879	(Reuters) - Actress Lindsay Lohan was involved in a scuffle with a man at a New York hotel on Sunday, police said, over what media reports described as her demand that photos of her be deleted from his cellphone.Investigators took reports from both Lohan, 26, and the man, but charges appeared unlikely, said a spokeswoman for the New York City Police Department. A misdemeanor assault charge filed earlier in the day against the man was dropped, the spokeswoman said.Police declined to confirm local media reports identifying the man as Christian LaBella, 25, of California, a staffer with Congressman John Shimkus, an Illinois Republican."Nobody's been arrested, there's no assault," the police spokeswoman told Reuters. "Reports were taken and both parties were able to give their account of what took place."Lohan's spokesman Steve Honig earlier in the day said Lohan suffered minor injuries in what he described as an attack, and said her assailant was arrested."Lindsay was victim of an assault," Honig said. "She does not face any charges."Celebrity website TMZ.com, citing sources close to the actress, identified the attacker as a man Lohan met at a New York nightclub.The two began arguing in Lohan's hotel room after she noticed he was taking pictures of her with his cellphone, TMZ and E! News reported.Lohan told police the man threw her to the ground, climbed on top of her and tried to choke her before someone else pulled him off, TMZ said.Honig declined comment on the media reports.The actress, who has been in and out of court, rehab and prison in recent years, was arrested in New York last week after a pedestrian told police that her car had struck him in an alley. She was charged with leaving the scene of an accident, a misdemeanor. (Reporting by Kevin Gray, Chris Michaud and James B.

354	loretta-lynn-celebrates-50-years-opry-033316960	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The story of Loretta Lynn's first experience with the Grand Ole Opry five decades ago sounds a little like the storyline from one of her classic songs.Lynn celebrated her 50th anniversary with country music's keystone showcase on Tuesday night in front of a standing room-only crowd at the Opry House. An emotional Miranda Lambert and her Pistol Annies, Lynn's sister Crystal Gayle, Lee Ann Womack and Trace Adkins were among the stars to perform for Lynn, who sat in the front row wearing a gold-sequined gown and a bashful smile.Lynn shared her first memories of the Opry with reporters at a news conference before the show."Well me and my husband got into town the night before and we spent the night in the car out in front of the Grand Ole Opry" at Ryman Auditorium, Lynn said during a news conference before the celebration of her 50th anniversary on the Opry. "And we slept and the next morning of course we didn't have any money, so the next morning we divided a doughnut."The salutes to Lynn were heartfelt. Lambert recounted her first conversation with Lynn in the 80-year-old Country Music Hall of Fame member's kitchen and fought back tears during the news conference. Womack remembered that pile of cassette tapes that kept a lonely Texas teen company.Angaleena Presley of Pistol Annies said she lost it the second that the trio stepped out on stage during soundcheck, forcing two trips to the makeup chair."For me it's like I could die tomorrow and I've already been in heaven tonight," Presley said. "I'm from where Loretta's from (in Kentucky) and I'm a coal miner's daughter and I grew up doing dishes to her records with my mom and have loved her since I was a little girl. I remember coming to the Opry when I was 17 and I saw her and I was standing in the front row just hoping and dreaming I'd be there some day. And tonight she's going to be in the front row listening to me sing one of her songs. I'm just so tickled to be here. I mean this is just it for me."It was the first appearance on the Opry for the Annies and Lynn said it's a night that will resonate for them forever — just like it has with her."The Grand Ole Opry is different and I think any Grand Ole Opry member will say that," Lynn said. "When you go on the Opry it's just absolutely a different feeling and it's something that you'll never feel again."___Online:http://opry.com___For the latest country music news from the Associated Press: http://twitter.com/AP_Country.

ComputerWorld reports on new numbers from research and analytics firm Net Applications showing that just 0.33% of all Windows-based computers ran on Windows 8 in September. For comparison’s sake, ComputerWorld notes that 1.64% of Windows-based computers were running on Windows 7 the month before it was released in 2009, meaning that the early adoption rate of Windows 7 was roughly five times that of Windows 8. Needless to say, if these numbers are reflection of how people feel about Windows 8, then it adds a lot more weight to some of the harsh criticisms hardware and software vendors have been lobbing at Microsoft in recent months.ReadGet more from BGR.com: Follow us on Twitter, Facebook	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	2	3	2	2	2	3	2	4
356	low-returns-hurt-demand-german-10-debt-sale-101433276--finance	LONDON (Reuters) - Germany failed to attract enough demand to meet its 5 billion euro target at a sale of 10-year bonds on Wednesday, as a record low rate of return deterred investors despite doubts over when Spain would seek a bailout.German authorities had to pick up 36 percent of the debt after commercial banks bought just 3.951 billion euros of the issue, meaning the sale was technically uncovered. Uncovered auctions are not uncommon for Germany, but the scale of the Bundesbank retention was exceptionally high.The bond offered a record low 1.5 percent interest rate.The launch of the bond on September 5 also failed to attract enough bids to cover the amount offered."At face value it doesn't look like a good auction. Nominal bids fell short of the 5 billion target. So once again in technical terms it is a failed auction," said Michael Leister, a strategist at Commerzbank."Although, against the backdrop of the current environment and Bunds having rallied quite a bit over the past sessions, it's obviously not a good auction but also not a disaster."Germany's safe-haven appeal has also been tarnished by the European Central Bank's pledge to buy bonds of struggling euro zone issuers, provided they seek aid, as part of its latest plan to curb the euro zone debt crisis.Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who is facing increasingly violent protests against austerity measures, told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Wednesday that he was ready to seek a bailout if Spain's debt financing costs stayed too high for too long.German Bund futures fell briefly to 140.69 from 140.78 just before auction result with cash 10-year yields 7 basis points lower on the day at 1.51 percent.The 10-year yield has risen 40 basis points since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi vowed in July to do whatever it took to save the euro. He later unveiled measures in early August to buy the bonds of the bloc's struggling issuers.(Editing by Nigel Stephenson)	2	3	3	3	2	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	1	3	3	4
357	lucky-norway-family-wins-national-lottery-three-times-121219258	OSLO (Reuters) - Good fortune and having children just seem to go together for Norwegian mother Hege Jeanette Oksnes.Each time the 29-year old petrol station attendant from tiny Austevoll island off Norway's west coast gives birth, someone in her family wins the national lottery."This is completely insane... we don't even play the lottery that often," Oksnes said only days after the family collected 12.2 million crowns ($2.12 million) with their third lottery win in six years.Oksnes, who serves hot dogs at a petrol station, gave birth to her first child in 2006 just one day after her father Leif won 4.2 million crowns on the national lottery.Three years later, Oksnes herself won, claiming 8.2 million crowns one day before giving birth to her second child.To complete the hat-trick, Oksnes' 18-year-old brother Tord won the very same lottery this weekend, just months after she gave birth to her third child.After three children though, it may be time to call it quits."My husband thinks we have enough money now," she said.Oksnes bought new cars with her winnings and did a bit of travelling, but has put most of the money in the bank, hoping to find a dream property to build a new house.($1 = 5.7502 Norwegian crowns)(Reporting by Joachim Dagenborg; Writing by Balazs Koranyi, editing by Paul Casciato)	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	2	4	1	3	2	3	1	3	4

359	magnetic-therapy-help-tinnitus-patients-162200017	Tinnitus is such a distracting condition that many who suffer from it develop depression. Illinois researchers are conducting a study to determine whether magnetic therapy can help people who suffer from this debilitating condition and depression. One of my parents struggled for years with depression related to this hearing problem.Researchers at Loyola University Medical Center are testing a new therapy known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), according to Newswise. Since 2009, it has been used to treat patients with major depression who have not been helped by at least one antidepressant.Tinnitus is a ringing or noise in the ears that affects about 20 percent of the population. The Mayo Clinic says that tinnitus is actually a symptom of an underlying condition like hearing loss related to age, a circulatory system disorder, or an ear injury. Sometimes medication is the cause.Patients hear unpleasant sounds even in silence: buzzing, clicking, roaring, whistling, and hissing. They can affect one or both ears, intermittently or all the time, from a low pitch to a high squeal. This annoying problem causes some patients to develop depression.Most people automatically associate tinnitus with musicians, audiences, or teachers subjected to loud music. However, some of those at highest risk are military personnel, who experience loud noise in their work, according to the American Tinnitus Association. Tinnitus ranks first for veterans from all periods of service as a service-related disability.Other risk factors include being older than 65, male, or Caucasian. Age-related hearing loss and having post-traumatic stress disorder are factors. Common treatments include addressing an underlying health condition and using various devices and techniques that mask the symptoms. However, there is no cure.The Loyola study is the first to follow subjects with both tinnitus and depression. Once the patient is comfortable, researchers place a magnetic coil next to the left side of the head. The coil transmits short pulses of magnetic fields to the brain, producing currents that stimulate brain cells.During each 35- to 40-minute treatment, these currents affect mood-regulating portions of the brain. Since patients need no anesthesia or sedation, they can immediately resume normal routines. The only reported side effects are mild headaches and a tingling in the scalp. Each subject receives five treatments a week for four to six weeks and is evaluated by a doctor three times.From her late 60s until her death at 81, my mother complained about a constant ringing in her ears. It was also apparent that she suffered from a significant hearing loss. When various attempts to relieve the noise failed, she took antidepressants for several years. Doctors now believe that these drugs can make tinnitus worse. If the misery she suffered was typical, it's easy to see why tinnitus patients with depression would be eager to try magnetic therapy.Vonda J.

362	man-awarded-7-million-eating-too-much-popcorn-175500081	A Denver man has just won $7.2 million in damages from the makers and sellers of his favorite snack — microwave popcorn. Wayne Watson, 59, ate bags of the stuff every day for years, and developed a potentially fatal condition known as "popcorn lung." What is this odd-sounding ailment, and is the company that made the treat really to blame? Here, a brief guide:What exactly is popcorn lung?It's the informal name for a rare ailment called bronchiolitis obliterans, an irreversible respiratory illness that causes wheezing, dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Patients have scarring in the bronchioles, the lung's smallest air passageways, and the damage makes it harder for them to breathe. Some people stricken with "popcorn lung" require lung transplants. In severe cases, it can be fatal.SEE ALSO: 100 orgasms a day: One woman's agonizing and rare medical disorderHow do you get popcorn lung?It's relatively common in people who have been exposed to high levels of diacetyl, an artificial flavoring used to give popcorn a buttery taste. Workers in factories that make microwave popcorn are the ones who usually suffer from it. The Centers for Disease Control recommends that anyone subjected regularly to the chemical wear a respirator and get regular breathing tests. Hundreds of popcorn-factory workers have sued over diacetyl exposure — winning settlements as high as $34 million — but Watson was the first consumer to go to court.Did Watson really get sick from eating popcorn?That's what he says — or at least, from inhaling popcorn fumes — and the jury sided with him. Watson says he first noticed something was wrong when he was singing in his church choir and couldn't "sustain notes like I used to." He went to a pulmonary specialist, who figured his problem had to be tied to something he was inhaling. On a hunch, the doctor asked Watson if he had been exposed to a lot of popcorn. Watson's jaw dropped.SEE ALSO: The world's first mother-daughter uterus transplants: A guideHow much popcorn did he eat?Watson told his doctor he had been eating two or three bags a day for 10 years. Later, air quality tests in his kitchen showed diacetyl contamination at factory levels when he was making popcorn. Not only that, but Watson said he used to savor inhaling the smell when he ripped open the bag. Now he won't go near the stuff.Is this really the fault of popcorn makers?Watson argued that a simple warning label would have been enough to keep him safe. "They thought that no consumer would ever be exposed to enough of it to make a difference," he says. "Well, they rolled the dice and they lose." The legal teams for Gilster-Mary Lee Corp, which manufactured the popcorn Watson bought, and supermarket chain The Kroger Co., which sold it, argued that Watson couldn't prove he fell ill because of his snack habit. They said he got sick because he worked with carpet-cleaning chemicals his entire career. Neither company had any immediate comment on the verdict, although the manufacturer issued a statement saying it was weighing its next step, and maintaining that its popcorn is perfectly safe.SEE ALSO: The 7-year-old girl who caught the bubonic plague — and livedSources: ABC News, BBC News, Los Angeles Times, YahooView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	3	4	3	3	2	2	2	2	3	2	3	2	1	2	2	4

364	man-fatally-shoots-self-tv-arizona-chase-070719257	PHOENIX (AP) — Authorities still haven't released the identity of a man who fatally shot himself in the head on live national television at the end of a high-speed carjacking chase that began in Phoenix and ended close to the California border.Fox News was covering the chase that began about midday Friday using a live helicopter shot from Phoenix affiliate KSAZ-TV. The man driving a copper-colored four-door sedan stopped, ran into the desert and placed a handgun to his head and fired.The man was declared dead at the scene, according to Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a Phoenix police spokesman.Fox News anchor Shepard Smith told viewers that the video was supposed to be on a 10-second delay so it could be cut off from airing if something went awry."We really messed up, and we're all very sorry," Smith said.Fox apologized for showing the violence on air."We took every precaution to avoid any such live incident by putting the helicopter pictures on a five second delay," said Michael Clemente, executive vice president of news editorial. "Unfortunately, this mistake was the result of a severe human error and we apologize for what viewers ultimately saw on the screen."More frequently than its rivals, Fox News Channel picks up car chases from its local affiliates and airs them live. It's gripping television, a live mystery with no clear resolution, and often provides a short-term ratings boost as viewers tune in to see how it ends. Critics say the chases themselves rarely rise to the level of national news. The Phoenix station was not airing the chase live when it ended.Thompson said the man allegedly stole a car from a couple at gunpoint outside a Phoenix restaurant just before 11 a.m. MST.Police officers located the vehicle and began a pursuit and the man fired several shots, Thompson said. He said at least one shot hit the police vehicle but the officers escaped injury.The suspect headed west on Interstate 10, then pulled onto a dirt road near the town of Tonopah that Thompson said was "70 to 80 miles east of the California line."TV footage showed the man exiting the vehicle and running erratically in a field before putting the gun to his head and firing. He then fell to the ground."Efforts to revive him were not successful and he was dead at the scene," Thompson said. "We don't have an ID yet."Fox returned repeatedly to shots showing the car passing big-rig trucks that typically travel at about 70 mph as if they were standing still.Police cars did not appear to be immediately behind the car during most of the chase.Smith was narrating the video and clearly had his doubts about what was being shown from the moment the man stopped the car. "This scares me," he said."You wait for the end of these things and you worry about how they may end up," he said. "This makes me a little nervous, I got to tell you. A little nervous."After the man shot himself, Fox's picture quickly cut to Smith, who was shouting "get off, get off, get off, get off."Smith apologized repeatedly following the commercial break."That didn't belong on TV. We took every precaution we knew how to take to keep that from being on TV and I personally apologize to you that that happened," he said.___AP television writer David Bauder reported from New York.

365	man-mounts-protest-dome-st-peters-223001280	VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - An Italian man clambered onto a ledge on the huge dome of St Peter's Basilica on Tuesday to stage a precarious protest against Prime Minister Mario Monti and the European Union.Video footage showed the man, identified as Marcello Di Finizio, jumping over railings near the top of the 137-m- (450- ft-) high dome on Tuesday afternoon, shocking visitors taking a tour. He then tied a cord to the railings and abseiled to a ledge over a window in the cupola.Tottering on the ledge, Di Finizio unveiled a banner reading: "Help! Enough Monti, Enough Europe! Enough Multinationals!".He remained on the dome into Tuesday night, flashing a strobe light as Vatican police and firefighters worked to find a way to bring him down to safety.Alex Giuzio, a friend of the protester, told Reuters that Di Finizio owns a beach bar that rents out parasols and lounge chairs to sunbathers.He said he is angry about a European Union directive and Italian government plan that will see licences to operate patches of seafront auctioned off transparently from 2016.Beach workers say the plan will favour multinational companies over smaller local businesses.Di Finizio has staged several public protests against the plans, and had already climbed out onto St Peter's dome during a shorter protest in July when he demanded a meeting with Tourism Minister Piero Gnudi, according to beach industry website Mondo Balneare.(Reporting By Gabriele Pileri and Catherine Hornby; Editing by Michael Roddy)	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	2	2	3	2	2	1	2	4	4
366	mannion-leads-beavers-past-bruins-27-20-002747018	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — The attention entering Saturday's Oregon State-UCLA game was focused mainly on the Bruins' offense, led by one of the country's finest young quarterbacks and the nation's leading rusher.The Beavers' duo of Sean Mannion and Storm Woods stole the spotlight.Mannion passed for a career-high 379 yards and two touchdowns, Woods rushed for 96 yards and another score, and underdog Oregon State put the clamps on No. 19 UCLA in opening its Pacific 12 Conference season by beating the Bruins 27-20.The victory was the 74th at Oregon State for coach Mike Riley, matching the school record set by Lon Stiner, the Beavers' coach from 1933-48. Riley is in his 12th year with Oregon State."It was a great job by our team, I just loved it," Riley said. "That was a really good group of offensive players and a good offensive scheme and I thought we just kept playing. When something bad happened, nobody blinked and somebody else made a play."Mannion completed 24 of 35 passes with one interception and has passed for 200 or more yards in 13 straight games. Woods, who carried 21 times, scored what turned out to be the deciding touchdown on a 2-yard run late in the third quarter and gained 62 of his yards after halftime.Oregon State's Markus Wheaton had nine receptions for 150 yards and a touchdown and has caught at least one pass in 25 consecutive games. Brandin Cooks had six catches for 175 yards and a TD for the Beavers."It feels unbelievable to beat a great team like that," said Mannion, a third-year sophomore. "We've got a lot of respect for (UCLA), they were tough start to finish. It feels great to come out and get a team win like that."Redshirt freshman Brett Hundley completed 27 of 42 passes for 372 yards and a touchdown for the Bruins. UCLA's Johnathan Franklin, the country's leading rusher with a 180.3-yard average, was held to 45 yards on 12 carries. He averaged 8.2 yards per carry previously this year."Our defense is awesome. I can't say that enough," Mannion said. "They gave us so many chances to make plays on offense. It's tough going against them in practice, so it's not surprising how good they are in the game. They're a great, great unit and I'm glad they're on our team."The Bruins (3-1, 0-1 Pac-12) scored 15 touchdowns and averaged 622.0 yards to rank second nationally in total offense in their previous three games. But the Beavers (2-0, 1-0) held them to 444 yards and two TDs."That was a tough loss, obviously, but our hats are off to Oregon State," first-year UCLA coach Jim Mora said. "That's a good defensive football team and a well-coached football team and they beat us. They have a very good run defense. They are big and physical up front."We have lots of lessons to learn from this. We'll see how we handle some adversity. I expect that we'll respond in the proper way, and we'll be ready to go next week."Oregon State had played just once in the season's first three weeks, beating then-No. 13 Wisconsin 10-7 on Sept. 8. The season opener against Nicholls State was postponed because of concerns over Hurricane Isaac.Trailing 17-10, the Bruins blew two scoring chances in the third quarter. First, they failed to convert a fourth-and-2 at the Oregon State 35-yard line after Anthony Barr forced a fumble by Mannion at the Beavers 43 and Tevin McDonald recovered.The Bruins got another chance when Stan McKay intercepted Mannion's pass at the Beavers 48 on the next play, but they were forced to punt.The Beavers then moved 88 yards on 13 plays to take a 24-10 lead, scoring Woods' short run one play after a pass interference penalty against Sheldon Price on third-and-goal."We've got to figure out a way in those situations to do a better job," Mora said regarding the missed opportunities.UCLA responded by getting a 1-yard sneak from Hundley that capped a 75-yard drive and made it 24-17 with 14:01 to play. The Beavers got their 10-point lead back on Trevor Romaine's 17-yard field goal with 9:33 left.The Bruins had a chance to get within seven points again, but Ka'imi Fairbairn was wide right on a 42-yard field goal with 7:37 to go. Fairbairn kicked a 35-yarder with 1:47 left, but Oregon State recovered UCLA's onside kick and ran out all but the final five secondsRomaine's 22-yard field goal on Oregon State's first possession gave the Beavers a 3-0 lead, but the Bruins tied it on a 22-yard field goal by Fairbairn early in the second quarter.Oregon State, a 7½-point underdog, took the lead back on the next scrimmage play — a 75-yard touchdown pass from Mannion to Cooks. Mannion's 42-yard scoring pass to Wheaton later in the second period made it 17-3.Hundley threw a 65-yard touchdown pass to Shaquelle Evans with 49 seconds remaining before halftime to trim Oregon State's lead to seven points.	2	4	4	4	3	3	2	3	2	4	2	3	2	2	3	3

368	markets-falter-focus-remains-spain-110647752--finance	LONDON (AP) — Markets stuttered Friday as investors continued to fret over the economy of Spain, which this week announced big spending cuts it hopes will convince potential bailout creditors and investors it has a rock-solid plan to heal its public finances.The positive momentum generated by Thursday's Spanish budget has ground to a halt as investors await more news out of the country, including stress test results into 14 banks that are due after European markets close.The Moody's rating agency is also expected to pronounce on its view on Spain's creditworthiness. There are concerns in the markets that Moody's will downgrade Spain's government debt to junk status.Craig Erlam, markets analyst at Alpari, said a downgrade to junk status could "create some panic" among holders of Spanish debt that could prompt a sell off and force yields higher."The positive side to this is this could accelerate the bailout request," Erlam said. Eurozone countries and the European Central Bank are prepared to help Spain financially, should it need it, but Madrid has so far put off a request.By midday in Europe, shares were mixed, with Madrid's IBEX index underperforming its peers.The IBEX was trading 1.1 percent lower at 7,756. Germany's DAX was 0.2 percent lower at 7,275 while the CAC-40 in France fell 0.5 percent to 3,421. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was one of the stronger performing indexes, trading 0.1 percent higher at 5,785.Wall Street was posed for a slightly lower open, too, with both Dow futures and the S&P 500 futures down 0.2 percent.On Thursday, the Spanish government said it planned to cut overall spending by €40 billion ($51 billion) in 2013, a move that won a generally-positive response in financial markets. Many investors think the cuts will lay the ground for Spain, the fourth largest economy in the eurozone, to seek financial help from fellow countries in the bloc and the European Central Bank.Earlier this month, the ECB announced a new bond-buying plan largely designed to keep a lid on Spain's borrowing costs. However, Spain would first have to ask for financial aid from fellow eurozone countries.Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has balked at doing so, partly because it could require new austerity cuts. The hope is that the new budget measures are enough to stem any further requirements in the event of a request for help."Yesterday's news was clearly a move to forestall the kind of punitive measures we saw imposed on Greece and others," said Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG.Other financial markets were fairly subdued, with the euro up 0.2 percent at $1.2936 and a barrel of oil up 38 cents at $92.23.Earlier in Asia, stocks had been buoyed by speculation that China's central bank will act soon to help the world's No. 2 economy.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.4 percent to 20,840.38. South Korea's Kospi added nearly 0.4 percent to 1,996.21. But Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.9 percent to 8,870.16, sinking on a government report that showed industrial production fell a further 1.3 percent in August.Mainland Chinese shares rose ahead of an extended holiday next week.

369	markets-steady-spain-bailout-hopes-111759583--finance	LONDON (AP) — Financial markets steadied Friday on hopes that Spain was preparing to tap a new European aid program, a day after uncertainty about the fragile global economy dented investor sentiment.Over recent weeks, markets have been buoyed by new measures to deal with Europe's debt crisis and hopes that central banks would offer new economic stimulus. Now that major central banks have provided the stimulus, investors are focused on the deteriorating global economy. Figures this week have mostly pointed to lower growth.On Thursday, further signs emerged of worsening conditions in Europe, Japan and China, leading to a retreat for stocks, as well as the euro and oil prices.Though those concerns remain, investor optimism was shored up Friday by hopes that Spain was negotiating with its partners in the eurozone on a new economic reform program. Experts see the reforms as the groundwork for Madrid to request financial aid from Europe's bailout fund and central bank.The ECB recently announced a bond-buying program meant to bring down the borrowing rates of countries that ask for financial aid. The plan has eased market tensions in Spain, but mainly on the assumption that Madrid will request the aid — something it has so far balked at doing."Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has attempted to delay making the decision for weeks now, however it appears the recent pressure from other European leaders has forced him into negotiations," said Craig Erlam, market analyst at Alpari.In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 0.2 percent at 5,843 while Germany's DAX rose an equivalent rate to 7,403. The CAC-40 in France was flat at 3,509 but Madrid's main IBEX index rose 0.5 percent to 8,059.Wall Street was poised for modest gains at the open, with both Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.2 percent.The euro has also recovered its poise in light of the Spanish hopes, trading 0.3 percent higher at $1.3011. Oil prices, which have also been under selling pressure in recent days, also recouped some losses, with the benchmark New York rate up 65 cents to $93.07 a barrel.Earlier in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index, gained 0.2 percent to 9,110.0 while China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent to 2,026.69.

370	mars-rover-curiosity-photo-reveals-crescent-moon-phobos-161737176	NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has been doing more than just driving around the Red Planet and taking pictures of rocks. It's been doing a bit of Martian moon-gazing too.The Curiosity rover's latest Mars photo captured the planet's largest Martian moon, Phobos, during a Martian evening, revealing the satellite as a faint crescent moon."Moon Over Mars: I snapped a pic of one of Mars' moons, Phobos, in the twilight sky over Gale crater," NASA's Curiosity team announced on the mission's Twitter page @MarsCuriosity, writing as the rover itself, on Wednesday (Sept. 26) — the same day Curiosity made its longest drive yet.The photo shows Phobos as a faint white crescent that almost blends in with the Martian sky. A black blemish also appears in the image, but is merely the result of a bad pixel in the image data, rover officials said."When you send images from 179 million miles away, stuff happens," they added via Twitter. The new photo of Phobos is Curiosity's latest view of Martian moons from the surface of the Red Planet. Earlier this month, Curiosity snapped photos of Phobos as it crossed part of the sun, creating a partial solar eclipse on Mars.Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, both of which are much smaller than Earth's moon. Phobos is about 14 miles wide (22 kilometers), making it the largest Martian satellite. Deimos is about 9.3 miles across (15 km) at its largest point and is farther from Mars than Phobos. The Curiosity rover's Phobos photos are just part of the science work the car-size robot has been performing on Mars. The rover landed inside the planet's vast Gale Crater on Aug. 5 and is currently driving toward its first science destination, a location called Glenelg.On Wednesday, Curiosity drove 160 feet (48.9 meters) closer to Glenelg, marking its longest single drive of its mission so far. To date, the rover has covered about a quarter-mile (416 meters) on Mars.NASA's Mars rover Curiosity is expected to spend at least two years exploring Gale Crater to determine if the region could have ever supported microbial life. Mission scientists plan to drive the rover up a 3-mile (5-km) mountain — Mount Sharp —that rises from the crater's center.NASA will hold a press conference today at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) today to update the media and public on Curiosity's progress on Mars.

371	mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426	NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has discovered what appears to be an ancient streambed, suggesting that water once flowed in large volumes — perhaps hip-deep in places — across the Martian surface.Photos from the Curiosity rover have revealed several different rocky outcrops that contain stones cemented into a layer of conglomerate rock. Some of these stones are rounded and large, indicating that they were transported relatively long distances across the Red Planet surface by water.This water flow was likely quite vigorous, perhaps akin to the flows produced by flash floods in desert areas here on Earth, researchers said."From the size of gravels it carried, we can interpret the water was moving about 3 feet per second, with a depth somewhere between ankle and hip deep," Curiosity co-investigator William Dietrich, of the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement. [The Search for Water on Mars (Photos)]"Plenty of papers have been written about channels on Mars with many different hypotheses about the flows in them," Dietrich added. "This is the first time we're actually seeing water-transported gravel on Mars. This is a transition from speculation about the size of streambed material to direct observation of it."The findings came after researchers studied photographs of three different outcrops inside Gale Crater, where Curiosity touched down on Aug. 5.The first outcrop, known as Goulburn, lies a few feet from the rover's landing site. Curiosity spotted the other two — called Link and Hottah — as it's been rambling toward an area called Glenelg, its first major science target.Photos of Link really got the team thinking of long-ago stream flows, Curiosity chief scientist John Grotzinger, of Caltech in Pasadena, told reporters today (Sept. 27). And images of Hottah, which juts from the Red Planet surface at an odd angle, pretty much sealed the deal."Hottah looks like someone jack-hammered up a slab of city sidewalk, but it's really a tilted block of an ancient streambed," Grotzinger said in a statement.On Earth, tilted outcrops are usually the result of tectonic activity. But Hottah could have been deformed by a nearby impact or other process, Grotzinger said.The water on Mars likely flowed several billion years ago, researchers said, though an exact timeframe will be tough to determine. But the extent of the system that produced the outcrops — and the surrounding alluvial fan and channels — suggests that it wasn't produced in a single shot.Rather, water was likely flowing over a relatively long chunk of time, scientists said."I'm comfortable to argue that it's certainly beyond the thousand-year timescale, but we're still gathering data to go further with that," Dietrich told reporters today.The team has not yet analyzed Link or Hottah with Curiosity's 10 different science instruments; rather, the researchers' conclusions are based on images of Mars snapped by the rover's Mast Camera. But those pictures capture plenty of evidence, Grotzinger said."In some cases, when you do geology, a picture's worth a thousand words," he said.The $2.5 billion Mars rover Curiosity is about 50 days into a roughly two-year mission to determine if the Gale Crater area has ever been capable of supporting microbial life.Despite the outcrop discoveries, the six-wheeled robot's ultimate destination remains the base of Mount Sharp, a 3.4-mile-high (5.5 kilometers) mountain that rises from Gale's Center. The mysterious mountain's foothills show signs of long-ago exposure to liquid water."A long-flowing stream can be a habitable environment," Grotzinger said. "It is not our top choice as an environment for preservation of organics, though. We're still going to Mount Sharp, but this is insurance that we have already found our first potentially habitable environment."Follow SPACE.com senior writer Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall or SPACE.com @Spacedotcom.

372	mass-chemist-drug-test-flap-arrested-160136833	BOSTON (AP) — A Massachusetts chemist accused of faking drug results, forging paperwork and mixing samples at a state police lab in a case that has thrown thousands of criminal cases into doubt was arrested Friday.Annie Dookhan, 34, was led to a police cruiser at her home in Franklin, about 40 miles southwest of Boston. Dookhan's alleged mishandling of drug samples prompted the shutdown of the Boston lab last month and resulted in the resignation of three officials.State police say Dookhan tested more than 60,000 drug samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the lab. Defense lawyers and prosecutors are scrambling to figure out how to deal with the fallout.Since the lab closed, more than a dozen drug defendants are back on the street while their attorneys challenge the charges based on Dookhan's misconduct.Many more defendants are expected to be released. Authorities say more than 1,100 inmates are currently serving time in cases in which Dookhan was the primary or secondary chemist.The scandal prompted the resignation of the state's public health commissioner and the resignations of two others.Dookhan is charged with witness intimidation, a crime punishable by as many as 10 years in prison, and pretending to hold a degree, punishable by as much as a year in jail.Dookhan had once testified under oath that she holds a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts, but school officials have said they have no record of her receiving an advanced degree or taking graduate courses there.It is unclear whether anyone else will face charges, but Dookhan's supervisors have faced harsh criticism for not removing her from lab duties after suspicions about her were first raised by her co-workers and for not alerting prosecutors and police."I think that all of those who are accountable for the impact on individual cases need to be held accountable," Gov. Deval Patrick said Thursday.Co-workers began expressing concern about Dookhan's work habits several years ago, but her supervisors allowed her to continue working. Dookhan was the most productive chemist in the lab, routinely testing more than 500 samples a month, while others tested between 50 and 150.One co-worker told state police he never saw Dookhan in front of a microscope. A lab employee saw Dookhan weighing drug samples without doing a balance check on her scale.In 2010, a supervisor did an audit of Dookhan's paperwork, but didn't retest any of her samples. The audit found nothing wrong.The same year, a chemist found seven instances where Dookhan incorrectly identified a drug sample as a certain narcotic when it was something else. He told state police he told himself it was an honest mistake.In an interview with state police late last month, Dookhan allegedly admitted faking test results for two to three years. She told police she identified some drug samples as narcotics simply by looking at them instead of testing them, a process known as "dry labbing." She also said she forged the initials of colleagues and deliberately turned a negative sample into a positive for narcotics a few times.She was eventually suspended from lab duties after getting caught forging a colleague's initials on paperwork in June 2011. She resigned in March as the Department of Public Health investigated. The lab was run by the department until July 1, when state police took over as part of a state budget directive.Dookhan told state police she just wanted to get the work done and never meant to hurt anyone."I screwed up big-time," she is quoted as saying in a state police report. "I messed up bad; it's my fault. I don't want the lab to get in trouble."___Niedowski reported from Franklin.	4	4	2	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	2	2	1	3	4	4
373	mass-lab-could-taint-1-100-inmates-cases-062414913	BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts officials say they have identified more than 1,100 defendants serving state sentences based at least partly on drug tests by a chemist accused of failing to follow protocols and mishandling samples in a now-closed state drug lab.David Meier, an attorney appointed to help sort through the legal quagmire, released the number on Monday. Officials say chemist Annie Dookhan was involved in testing more than 60,000 drug samples involving about 34,000 defendants.Meier says it's unclear how many of the cases might have been tainted. He says prosecutors and defense attorneys have been given the list because Gov. Deval Patrick has given priority to incarcerated people. Meier says lawyers must bring those cases before a judge.The state attorney general's office is conducting a criminal investigation. Dookhan hasn't been charged.	3	3	3	3	2	4	3	2	3	2	2	2	1	2	2	4
374	mass-lab-probe-starts-1-140-inmate-cases-104607507	BOSTON (AP) — Faced with the daunting task of evaluating more than 34,000 drug cases handled by a Massachusetts chemist accused of misconduct, prosecutors and defense attorneys are starting with 1,140 cases of people who are already serving prison sentences based on potentially tainted evidence.David Meier, a defense attorney and former prosecutor appointed to help sort through the legal quagmire created by the chemist's alleged actions, on Monday turned over a list of 690 people currently serving sentences in state prisons and 450 who are currently serving sentences in county jails. Samples in all of the cases were tested by chemist Annie Dookhan, who state police say failed to follow testing protocols and deliberately mishandled evidence in some cases.Meier said it is unclear how many of those samples might have been tainted by Dookhan's actions, but said both sides want to deal first with people who are already in prison."That is our first priority, people who are presently incarcerated," he said.Meier said lawyers in those cases will now have to work out resolutions on a case-by-case basis."The merits and any alleged issues in any one of those cases is for prosecutors and defense attorneys and judges to determine," he said.State police have said Dookhan was involved in testing more than 60,000 drug samples involving about 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the Boston lab. Dookhan resigned in March during an internal investigation by the state Department of Public Health, which ran the lab until state police took over on July 1 as part of a budget directive.Meier, who was appointed by Gov. Deval Patrick last week, met Monday with a group of district attorneys, defense attorneys and public safety officials. After the meeting, Meier said he turned over a list of currently incarcerated defendants whose cases were worked on by Dookhan, either as the primary chemist, who performs an initial test on a drug sample, or as the secondary chemist, who performs a second, confirmatory test.The list does not include thousands of people who are currently awaiting trial, are on probation or are serving federal sentences in cases in which Dookhan tested drug samples.Since the lab was closed last month, judges in Suffolk and Norfolk counties have already begun to hear motions filed by defense attorneys seeking bail reductions for drug defendants awaiting trial in cases handled by Dookhan. Prosecutors have agreed to many of those motions, citing possibly tainted evidence.Dookhan hasn't been charged, but the state attorney general's office is conducting a criminal investigation.On Monday, a judge in Boston agreed to put the sentences of career criminal David Huffman on hold and set bail for him at $75,000 cash, with GPS monitoring. The 55-year-old Huffman had pleaded guilty in August to trafficking in heroin and cocaine, possession of oxycodone with the intent to distribute and unlawful possession of ammunition and a firearm as an armed career criminal He began serving concurrent seven- to 10-year sentences last month.Huffman's lawyer, Bernard Grossberg, said the next step will likely be for the defense to ask that Huffman be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea."He would not have pleaded guilty to the gun charges if it was not part and parcel of his plea on the drug charges," Grossberg said.Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Dan Conley, said prosecutors opposed the motion to put his sentence on the gun charges on hold. He said the gun evidence was tested in a different lab and was unaffected by the drug lab scandal."This is an individual who's been involved in just about every type of property and violent crime over the course of 40 years. He is a mid-tier narcotics distributor and was a plague on the community," Wark said."We believe the judge should have treated the two cases separately," he said.Dookhan has not responded to repeated requests for comment. Her father, Rasheed Khan, told The Associated Press that she had been "bullied and abused," but he would not say by whom."No one has heard her side of the story," Khan said outside his home in Kissimmee, Fla., on Saturday.State police have said Dookhan failed to follow testing protocols and deliberately mishandled evidence in some cases.In a letter sent to defense attorneys earlier this month, Max Stern, the president of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said he was told during a meeting with state officials that Dookhan was accused of deliberately tampering with evidence, including the weight of drug samples, which can affect the length of sentences given to drug defendants.___Associated Press Writer Mike Schneider contributed from Kissimmee, Fla.	3	4	4	3	4	4	3	3	3	2	3	2	1	4	4	4

377	mayor-struggling-ri-city-admit-corruption-181446837	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The longtime mayor of struggling Central Falls resigned and has agreed to plead guilty to a federal corruption charge of accepting gifts in exchange for handing out a lucrative contract to board up city houses, according to papers filed Wednesday by federal prosecutors.Charles Moreau and his friend, businessman Michael Bouthillette, were charged. Bouthillette was charged with one count of giving gifts, according to the documents.Moreau and Bouthillette acknowledge in a plea agreement that Bouthillette paid at least in part for a furnace installed at Moreau's former Central Falls home and for renovations at a home Moreau owned in Lincoln.In exchange, Moreau used his emergency powers to order homes that were foreclosed be boarded up by Bouthillette's business.Court papers say Bouthillette boarded up at least 167 houses from 2007 to 2009 and made "unreasonable profits" of hundreds of thousands of dollars. When city employees questioned the amounts Bouthillette was charging for the work, the documents show, Moreau dismissed the concerns, on one occasion telling an employee to "mind his own ... business."Moreau, who resigned as mayor effective at noon Wednesday, did not answer calls placed to his phone and a message could not be left. His lawyer, William J. Murphy, and Bouthillette's lawyer, C. Leonard O'Brien, did not immediately return calls for comment.Central Falls had a deficit of more than $6 million on an annual budget of about $16 million by the time a state-appointed received filed for bankruptcy on its behalf, the first time ever in Rhode Island, in August 2011. Moreau was stripped of his duties — along with his key to City Hall — about a year earlier when the state stepped in.About a quarter of the city's 19,000 residents live below the poverty level, according to census data, and the city has one of the state's highest foreclosure rates.Moreau has been the target of a yearslong investigation by federal and state authorities into whether he improperly accepted gifts from Bouthillette.City Council President William Benson Jr. told the AP on Wednesday he is disappointed and that he's "sorry that it's come to this.""It's terrible for the city," he said. "I feel real bad. The city's going through enough problems as it is."He said he is waiting to hear from the receiver, John McJennett III, and City Hall on next steps.Under the city charter, the president of the City Council would serve as the acting mayor. But the receiver, under state law, has the powers of both the mayor and City Council.Moreau was first elected to lead the state's smallest city in 2003. He would have been up for election next year and planned to run again.Moreau, who sold his house in Central Falls last year but said he was staying with a friend, often referred to the receivership as a "dictatorship." Along with several City Council members, he took a challenge of the state receivership law all the way to the state Supreme Court, arguing unsuccessfully that it violated their rights as elected leaders and infringed on the city's constitutionally-protected sovereignty.A report on the city's financial problems by the first receiver, Mark Pfeiffer, didn't place blame solely on Moreau or the rest of the elected leadership. It cited $80 million in unfunded pension and benefits obligations, a loss in state aid and anticipated revenue that never materialized. But Pfeiffer also noted a "culture of government" that allowed the crisis to spiral.A federal judge this month signed off on a five-year recovery plan for Central Falls, paving the way for its exit from municipal bankruptcy and, eventually, the return of its elected government.State Revenue Director Rosemary Booth Gallogly will determine when the elected leadership comes back, but only after she feels confident they understand and will implement the plan. The budget for the current fiscal year has them returning in January.A spokeswoman for Gov. Lincoln Chafee, Christine Hunsinger, said Wednesday the governor has faith in McJennett and Gallogly to provide oversight in Central Falls. She could not immediately answer questions about what will happen next given Moreau's resignation.___Follow Michelle R.

That's how Stella McCartney, backstage, describes her fresh, optimistic and relaxed spring-summer outing.If she hoped the collection to be everyday, the show itself — in the gilded foyer of the Paris Opera Garnier with ornate, swinging double chandeliers in gold , not to mention the famous faces like Kate Moss, Salma Hayek and McCartney's former Beatle father Paul — was not.It's hard to be casual when you were born with one of the most famous dads on the planet — but she got full marks for trying.Silhouettes ignored the waist, with a cool, low-slung belted vibe, and the big curves of last season were gone.Thinking outside the box, McCartney created some fantastic elliptical curves in vibrant saffron yellow and forest green.With delicate dense knife pleats these ellipses visually sculpted a feminine shape that was highly flattering to busts and waists, like a geometric hourglass.Some of the broderie anglaise looks added a play on transparency, but the best of the show came with an on-trend safari theme.Black and white camouflage print looked fantastic on a silky jumpsuit, worn by sassy model of the moment Karlie Kloss.This look wasn't exactly everyday, but it's sure going to sell.___Follow Thomas Adamson at http:/ /Twitter.com/ThomasAdamsonAP	4	4	2	2	2	1	3	4	2	2	3	3	3	1	2	3
379	mcilroy-mcdowell-18th-win-europes-first-point-181604104--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - World number one Rory McIlroy and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell had a three-hole lead disappear before rising at the 18th hole to win the first point for Europe at the Ryder Cup on Friday.The duo, sent out first by Europe captain Jose Maria Olazabal, snared a critical point from Americans Jim Furyk and Brandt Snedeker when McIlroy blasted out from a bunker to five feet and McDowell sank the par putt for a 1-up victory."It was a great game of golf, it really personified the Ryder Cup this morning," McDowell told reporters on the 18th green after sinking the putt that allowed Europe to finish the opening foursomes session tied 2-2."We played some great golf to be 3-up and two very gutsy players come back at us with a few birdies and we're playing these last two holes all square and having to hit some quality shots down the stretch."A run of six birdies in seven holes from the fourth boosted the Europeans, who led by three holes through the 12th.That streak was started by a chip-in by McIlroy from behind the green at the fourth that charged up the Europeans who felt wronged after Furyk had not allowed McDowell to take relief from a ball sitting close by a sprinkler head on the second hole.The Americans, however, fought back and ran off a string of three successive birdies from the 14th to level the alternate-shot match.At the 18th, Snedeker sent his drive way right among the oak trees and pantomimed snapping his driver in half at the tee. McIlroy's drive was also headed right but clipped a branch and dropped into light rough alongside a fairway bunker.Furyk punched out through a tight lane to put the ball on the fairway and Snedeker stuck his approach shot about 15 feet from the cup.McDowell's approach found a bunker below the green, but McIlroy put pressure on the U.S. by blasting out to five feet.Furyk's right-to-left par putt broke away just inside the hole, making McDowell's putt good for a point in the European column."It was a great match," said 23-year-old McIlroy. "They came back at us. Unfortunately, Brandt didn't hit a very good tee shot there at the last and we were able to take advantage."McDowell praised his playing partner."My job is easy. I'm playing alongside the greatest player on the planet right now," said the 2010 U.S. Open champion, who described McIlroy's sand shot as "phenomenal."McIlroy returned the bouquet."If I had to choose anyone on either of these two sides to have to hole that putt to win at the last, it would have to be G-Mac," the number one said about McDowell, who clinched the winning putt in Europe's victory over the U.S. team two years ago in Wales.(Editing by Frank Pingue)	3	4	4	4	5	2	2	4	3	4	2	3	3	1	3	
380	mcqueary-files-defamation-suit-against-penn-state-214053419--spt	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A former Penn State graduate assistant who complained he saw former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky showering with a young boy on campus in 2001 and testified at his sex abuse trial this summer sued the university on Tuesday for what he says is defamation and misrepresentation.Mike McQueary's whistle-blower lawsuit claims his treatment by the university since Sandusky was arrested on child molestation charges in November has caused him distress, anxiety, humiliation and embarrassment. It seeks millions of dollars in damages.Penn State spokesman Dave La Torre declined to comment on Tuesday, and McQueary's lawyer Elliot Strokoff did not return a phone message.The lawsuit discloses that shortly after Sandusky was charged, the university's then-president, Graham Spanier, met with athletic department staff inside the football stadium and expressed his support for athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz, who had been charged with perjury and failure to properly report suspected child abuse in the Sandusky case. Spanier also issued a public statement with the same message.Curley, now on leave, and Schultz, who has retired, have repeatedly denied the charges against them and await trial.McQueary, whose contract with Penn State wasn't renewed, testified that he came upon Sandusky and the boy in a team shower in a sexually suggestive position on a Friday night in early 2001.He told jurors at Sandusky's trial he heard a "skin-on-skin smacking sound" and what he saw was "more than my brain could handle." He said the boy's hands were against a wall and Sandusky was behind him, with his midsection moving subtly.McQueary reported the episode to then-head football coach Joe Paterno, who in turn alerted Curley and Schultz. Paterno was fired after the three men were charged, and he died of complications from lung cancer in January.McQueary claims that the November meeting with Spanier "clearly suggest(ed) that (McQueary) was lying in his reports and testimonies that he had reported the sexual misconduct.""Spanier's statements have irreparably harmed (McQueary's) reputation for honesty and integrity, and have irreparably harmed (his) ability to earn a living, especially in his chosen profession of coaching football," the lawsuit said.Messages left for Spanier and his lawyer on Tuesday were not immediately returned.The lawsuit said McQueary learned his contract was not being renewed, meaning he was no longer a university employee, from a news conference held in July by the university's new president, Rodney Erickson. He said his salary last year was $140,000 and his future earnings as a coach would amount to at least $4 million.Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator, was convicted in June on charges he sexually abused 10 boys, some on campus. He remains jailed awaiting sentencing.Eight young men testified against Sandusky, describing a range of abuse they said went from grooming and manipulation to fondling, oral sex and anal rape when they were boys. One young man testified his muffled screams from the basement of the Sandusky home in State College, where Penn State is based, went unanswered as Sandusky attacked him.The 68-year-old Sandusky maintains his innocence, acknowledging he showered with boys but insisting he never molested them. Given his age and the serious nature of the crimes of which he was convicted, he's likely to receive a sentence that will keep him in prison for life.___Online:Complaint: http://bit.ly/QGGAwt	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	3	2	2	3	2	1	3	4	4

They can also be trained like a person, with the robots capable of juggling multiple tasks, and learning a new one in less than 30 minutes (Check out the video above to see them in action).Priced at $22,000 and with no integration required, Baxter robots are "a fraction of the cost of a traditional industrial robot," according to Rethink. "Baxter was specifically designed to be affordable for mid-size and small manufacturers, companies that have never been able to afford robots before.""We [can] offer new hope to the millions of American manufacturers who are looking for innovative ways to compete in our global economy."The androids are ready to start work in less than one hour after they hit the factory floor, the company adds.Baxter is a complete, self-contained system with application software that can be updated. Rethink says it plans to offer a software development kit in early 2013 for those who want to make use of the technology.Unveiled Tuesday, the robots are available on pre-order; first product shipments will begin this October.Do you think Baxter robots will foster cooperation or competition?

383	men-charge-bedroom-163414859	Sticking to traditional gender roles could make you less comfortable and less safe in the bedroom. In a new study, young adults who assumed that men should take charge during sex were less likely to feel confident in sexual situations and less perceptive to using female condoms.The study, published online Sept. 25 in the journal Sex Roles, involved 357 women and 126 men (ages 18-29) from a public university in the Northeast, all heterosexual and sexually active. The researchers, led by Lisa Rosenthal from Yale University, gave the students a survey to measure their sexual confidence, asking them how assertive they were about getting sexual satisfaction from a partner, using a condom and taking precautions for safer sex.They also examined the students' support for social power inequalities and hierarchies based on their agreement with statements such as: "It’s OK if some groups have more of a chance in life than others;" and "The man should be the one who dictates what happens during sex." (The endorsement of such power dynamics has been linked to sexism, negative attitudes toward women's rights and a greater tolerance of sexual harassment.)In the private cubicle where the students filled out their survey, there was a bowl of female condoms with a sign that read: "Protect yourself and your partner. Please take some! FREE FEMALE CONDOMS." There were small pamphlets next to the bowl about how to use female condoms, which are inserted into the vagina before sex.The more men and women endorsed hierarchical power dynamics, the more likely they were to believe men should dominate during sex and the less likely they were to take the free female condoms and report confidence in sexual situations, the researchers said."If men believe that men should dominate sexually, this may prevent them from feeling open or comfortable discussing sexual behavior and protection with their partners or asking questions about things they may not know," which could lead to reduced sexual confidence, wrote the researchers."For both women and men, the belief that men should dominate sexually could reduce interest in female condoms, because female condoms are meant to be a woman-centered source of protection and may be seen as violating the norm or belief that men should be in control of sexual situations," Rosenthal and her team explained.Women in the study were generally less likely than men to believe that men should dominate in the bedroom, the study's authors noted.

Now an individual familiar with the project has told TheWrap that buyers are being presented with a pre-AFM package that includes the two A -list actresses.Swank will play the frontier woman, but it was not clear which role Streep would play. Streep also starred with Jones this year in "Hope Springs."Michael Fitzgerald will produce "The Homesman" through his Ithaca Films label, while Jones will produce through The Javelina Film Company. Luc Besson's EuropaCorp. is producing financing and distributing the film internationally.Jones made his directorial debut with TNT's "The Good Old Boys."

386	mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987	LONDON (Reuters) - Middle-aged men from disadvantaged backgrounds are 10 times more likely to commit suicide, often because they have lost a sense of identity and masculine pride, researchers said on Thursday.In a report commissioned by the British helpline charity the Samaritans, health experts explored why men in their 30s, 40s and 50s are at such a substantially higher risk of ending their own lives.The findings suggest suicide is not simply a mental health problem, the researchers said, but also one of men's place in societies and of societies' inability to adapt to men's needs when trying to deal with depression, anxiety and other problems."While suicide is mental health issue.... it is also a social and health inequality issue. This is unjust and unreasonable," said Stephen Platt, a University of Edinburgh health policy research professor and trustee for the Samaritans, who presented the report at a briefing in London"The differences we are highlighting in this report.. are not ones that any civilized society should be comfortable with."While the report focused on Britain, the experts behind its findings were relevant to many developed countries across the world, especially those that have experienced a post-industrial shift to service-driven economiesIt said that men in mid-life are part of a "buffer" generation, not sure whether to be like their older, more traditional, silent, austere fathers or like their younger, more progressive, individualistic sons."The changing nature of the labor market over the last 60 years has affected working class men," it said. "With the decline of traditional male industries, they have lost not only their jobs but also a source of masculine pride and identity."The World Health Organisation estimates that every year, almost a million people commit suicide - a rate of 16 per 100,000, or one every 40 seconds. It also estimates that for every suicide, there are up to 20 attempted ones.Men are more likely to commit suicide than women in almost every country in the world, and the WHO says the main risk factors are mental illness - primarily depression - and alcohol abuse, as well as violence, loss, abuse and pressures from cultural and social backgrounds.The Samaritans study found that in Britain on average about 3,000 middle-aged men from disadvantaged backgrounds kill themselves each year.Platt described the findings as "shocking" said this high risk group could no longer be ignored."Men are often criticized for being reluctant to talk about their problems and for not seeking help," he said."With this in mind, we need to acknowledge that men are different to women and design services to meet their needs, so they can be more effective."(Reporting by Kate Kelland, editing by Paul Casciato)	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	1	3	3	4
387	middle-east-telcos-mull-alliance-facebook-fight-140326645	DUBAI (Reuters) - Middle East telecommunications firms are discussing the idea of creating a pan-Arab online platform that would earn them more revenue from their networks by challenging Facebook and other Internet behemoths of the West.The ambitious project faces technical and financial obstacles and may never be implemented on a large scale. But proponents argue the common language and culture shared by the world's more than 350 million Arabic speakers, plus the webs of affiliated companies which Gulf operators own across the Middle East and North Africa, could make the project viable."A single operator, even one in multiple geographies and with tens of millions of subscribers, can't create this platform on its own," said Osman Sultan, chief executive of du, the second biggest operator in the United Arab Emirates."It would be restricted to the customers of this operator and wouldn't have sufficient scale to succeed. But a unified platform spanning the Arab world would," he told Reuters.Sultan said he had proposed the idea to all major operators in the Arab world over the past 12 months.Behind the proposal is a frustration shared by telecommunications firms globally: as they spend heavily to build networks, data traffic on the networks is increasing rapidly, but the firms essentially only make money from charging for access to their networks - a low-margin business.The lion's share of new revenue from traffic is being taken by so-called "over-the-top" (OTT) Internet companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Twitter. The telecommunications firms have unsuccessfully pressed them for bigger contributions to the cost of building the networks."OTT players...we can't share their gain and they won't share our pain," said Sultan. "Network traffic doubles every eight to nine months, but revenue is heading to a plateau, so we need to claim part of the new revenues alongside OTT players."VERY DIFFICULTThe proposed Arab online platform would feature social media and online shopping for goods and services, including digital content such as music, video and applications, Sultan said.He declined to give details, saying parts of the talks were confidential, and most other Arab telecommunications operators contacted by Reuters declined to comment or did not respond to requests for commentBut Sheikh Mohamed Al Khalifa, chief executive of Bahrain Telecommunications Co, welcomed the idea."Telcos are beginning to look to the deployment of OTT services such as streamed TV and video-on-demand," he said. "Such diversification (into) adjacent industries has become necessary. There are gains to be made by collaborating within our industry in the Middle East."Sceptics point to the fact that efforts by telecommunications firms elsewhere in the world to set up online ventures have often failed when faced with the technical savvy and marketing muscle of the established Internet giants."Fundamentally, it's very difficult to complete against OTT players - operators lack the agility and the core competencies as well as the brand appeal," said Guillermo Escofet, a senior analyst at Informa Telecom and Media in London."They're used to running networks, not being media companies. Also, operators instinctively try to differentiate themselves from each other - it's against their DNA to work together."London-listed Vodafone is one of a number of operators that have had difficulty creating Internet services. The Vodafone 360 service, based on customers' phone address books, was launched in Europe in 2009, letting customers import contacts from social networks and use an online application store. In 2011, Vodafone said it was winding down the service."Operators have failed miserably every time they have tried to move up the value chain, except for in certain business-to-business services," said Pedro Oliveira, a partner at global management consultants Oliver Wyman. "Some have tried to move into content and applications, but the war is lost already."The big Western Internet firms are already popular around the Middle East. Facebook, which offers an Arabic interface, had 45.2 million users in the Arab world as of June 30, up more than 50 percent from a year earlier, according to the Arab Social Media Report, produced by the Dubai School of Government.Despite pockets of innovation in the region, such as video game industries in Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and ventures developing applications for smart phones in Egypt, the Middle East has so far not come close to developing online products to rival the top Western Internet companies.FEASIBLEHowever, proponents of the telecommunications firms' online plan argue it is more feasible in the Arab world than elsewhere.Only about 1 percent of the world's websites are in Arabic, according to a survey by analysts W3techs. Internet penetration lags regions such as Europe, North America and east Asia, with only about 86 million of the estimated 360 million native Arabic speakers online at end-2011, Miniwatts Marketing Group said.Such figures may mean Western Internet firms are not yet so entrenched in the Middle East that they cannot be challenged. The new online platform would satisfy hunger among the region's young population for more Arabic-language content, said Sultan.Another factor is the impressive geographical reach of Gulf telecommunications firms; if a few of them can agree on introducing the online platform, they may be able to roll it out quickly across more than a dozen countries.Combined, Qatar Telecom, Saudi Telecom, Kuwait's Zain and the UAE's Etisalat cover 16 of the 22 Arab League countries. The other six countries are the smallest four in economic terms - Mauritania, Somalia, Djibouti and Comoros - plus war-ravaged Libya and Syria.The Arab telecommunications operators' extensive distribution networks and point-of-sale advertising could help them win customers from OTT players.Most Middle Eastern mobile phone subscribers are on pre-paid contracts typically topped up with scratch cards. These are sold everywhere from petrol stations to local stores, so vouchers for the online platform might easily be rolled out alongside them."The reach we have to consumers and the knowledge we have of consumer behavior is vast," Sultan said.Thomas Kuruvilla, managing director of consultants Arthur D. Little Middle East, said an alliance of regional telecommunications firms could form a community of social networks that was attractive to local populations.If the firms can cooperate on content and social networks, "it will surely attract more niche advertisers and hence higher revenue potential," he said.However, even if the region's biggest telecommunications firms succeed with the online platform, it will be hard for smaller operators to make much money from it, said Oliveira.This could consign smaller firms to serving as nothing more than low-margin pipes for the data services of the big ones.In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait have multiple telecommunications firms providing Internet access, and some of them may be the most vulnerable to becoming "dumb pipes". Such companies might cut access fees to their networks in an effort to win market share, Oliveira said."If one operator takes this approach, then others in the same market may be forced to follow as they lose revenue and market share and struggle to keep on investing in their network," he said. "It's a race to the bottom."(Editing by Andrew Torchia)	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	3	3	3	2	2	2	4	4
388	minneapolis-workplace-shooting-victims-remembered-082929998	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An Israeli immigrant who started a signage company in his basement and spent decades building it into a successful business was among five people slain by a fired employee at a Minneapolis workplace, authorities said.Also killed were an avid sculptor and painter with a day job there and a UPS driver who made pickups and deliveries to the company for years. Police said he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.Six people — including the suspected gunman — were shot to death Thursday afternoon at Accent Signage Systems, located in a quiet residential corner of northwest Minneapolis. Police say Andrew Engeldinger, 36, was fired from the company that afternoon and responded by fatally shooting others there before he turned the gun on himself in the building's basement.Among those killed were Reuven Rahamim, 61, the company's founder; Rami Cooks, 62, of Minnetonka; Jacob Beneke, 34, of Maple Grove; Ronald Edberg, 58, of Brooklyn Center; and Keith Basinski, 50, a Wisconsin native who was the UPS driver.No details were immediately released about why Engeldinger was fired, but Minneapolis Police Chief Tim Dolan said it appeared he singled out some victims and spared others. Engeldinger's family offered sympathy to the victims in a statement through the National Alliance on Mental Illness. It said he had struggled with mental illness for years."This is not an excuse for his actions, but sadly, may be a partial explanation," the statement said.Rahamim's family asked that the focus of the tragedy be on those killed rather than the gunman. Rahamim's son-in law, Chad Blumenfield, wrote in an email that he was born and raised on a farm in Israel and was a soldier in the Israeli Army before leaving for the U.S. after the Yom Kippur War, which occurred in 1973."He loved spending time with his children and grandchildren and especially loved to take his grandson for bike rides," Blumenfield wrote.Beneke had a wife and a young son, said Lorrie Link, who heads the Maple Grove Arts Center. She said Beneke was a volunteer there, where he displayed his work and promoted the work of other artists in the suburb northwest of Minneapolis.Beneke's Facebook page said he worked as digital imaging manager at Accent Signage Systems."He was just a very cool guy. He was very creative and expressive," Link said of the New Albin, Iowa, native. "His sculptures and paintings and drawings made us laugh."Basinski was a Wisconsin native dedicated to the Green Bay Packers. Dolan said he likely wasn't one of the gunman's primary targets but was killed simply because he happened to be there.Minneapolis Police Capt. Amelia Huffman said the scene at Accent Signage Systems was "very chaotic" and that it was taking time for police to put together a comprehensive chronology. She said there were more than 20 people scattered in the building when Engeldinger began firing, and witnesses only saw bits of what happened.Huffman said police believe Engeldinger got a letter of reprimand in the mail and came into the office Thursday afternoon. At that point, he was terminated."From the best we can tell, the incident started right after Mr. Engeldinger had been fired," Huffman said. She said there was a struggle in the office and shots were fired, which employees elsewhere in the building heard. Dolan said Engeldinger used a 9mm Glock semi-automatic pistol he had owned for about a year."And Mr. Engeldinger left the back office area and fired additional shots throughout the building," she said. Victims were shot throughout the building, she said.Police said the first 911 calls came in about 4:30 p.m. Thursday. Initially, three officers responded; Dolan said the shooting was over by the time they got there, and they entered the building to find a scene he described as "hellish." Dolan said those three officers were put on leave to give them time to recover."This scene is by far the most traumatic these officers have ever encountered," Dolan said.It took officers a long time to secure the very large building, he said. The company had no security, and Dolan said tactical units found two people hiding "a very long time" after the attack began.Later Thursday, SWAT teams and investigators searched Engeldinger's home in south Minneapolis. There they found a second gun and packaging for 10,000 rounds of ammunition in the house."He obviously had this gun and was practicing how to use this gun," Dolan said.Sue Abderholden, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness' Minnesota chapter, said Engeldinger's family had sought help from the group two years ago, with his parents taking a 12-week course on recognizing and dealing with mental illness.She said their concerns were "much more centered around paranoid thoughts. No violence or anything like that." The Engeldingers were not able to convince Andrew to seek treatment, she said.Andrew Engeldinger's uncle, Joe Engeldinger of New Germany, Minn., called his nephew a "good kid" who broke the hearts of family members when he broke off contact with them about two years ago."When I would see his family, I would ask them about Andy and nobody could ever tell me anything," Joe Engeldinger said.Chuck and Carolyn Engeldinger raised Andrew and his two siblings in the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield, Joe Engeldinger said."He wasn't a monster. He wasn't," Joe Engeldinger said. "He was a real good kid, a real good person. He had a real good heart. I don't know what made all this transpire. Hopefully the truth will come out and won't get twisted into some demented thing."The Minnesota Bureau of Labor and Industry said it was the deadliest workplace shooting since the agency began tracking such events in 1992. No more than two workers had died in such a shooting before this week, according to the St. Paul Pioneer Press.___Associated Press reporter Martiga Lohn contributed to this report.	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	3	3	2	3	2	1	3	4	4

390	mitt-romneys-47-percent-disaster-actually-golden-opportunity-094500594--election	As Mitt Romney continues to stand behind his surreptitiously recorded, admittedly "not elegantly stated" contention to wealthy donors that nearly half of American voters are dependent on government handouts, nursing "victim" complexes, and unlikely to vote for him, Republicans are split between banging their heads on their desks over this "47 percent disaster" and rushing to Romney's defense. David Frum at The Daily Beast is firmly in the head-banging camp, but wryly predicted that the other side would "become the definitive conservative point of view after Rush Limbaugh weighs in." Limbaugh didn't disappoint, calling the secret video "a golden opportunity" for Romney to "take the gloves off and take the fear off and just start explaining conservatism." Instead of a campaign-crushing disaster, could Romney's write-off of the moochers be the reboot he so sorely needs?Romney can make this a winning issue: Ignore the spin of the Obama-loving media, says Rush Limbaugh. "When [Romney] talks to his donors about these 47 percent that are locked into Obama, he does it with disappointment, sadness," but not resignation. He's not giving up on them. And now that he's got their attention, he has a "golden opportunity" to explain why his conservative policies will free them. "It's sitting there on a silver platter," but Romney has to "get out there, take this by the horns, turn it into a positive," and convince people that if they vote Romney "they don't have to be in that 47 percent.""A golden opportunity for Mitt Romney"SEE MORE: Mitt Romney's botched Libya response: Could it cost him the election?Are you kidding? This is an unmitigated disaster: The politics of Romney's "'47 percent' monstrosity" are terrible, says Joe Klein at TIME. He threw a huge number of his own voters, as well as decades of GOP tax policies, under the bus to play to "the fantasy prejudices of fat cats." Bad move. "Romney's adoption of the Fox-Rush neolibertarian sensibility" places him "in an impossible position," and now he'll have to "defend his fantasy in the debates." Since he can't, he's "rendered his campaign a parachute jump into quicksand, and he is sinking fast.""Bitter, clinging moochers"It all depends. Will Romney rise to the occasion? Look, "everyone gets knocked down in politics," and the good candidates get back up again, says Chris Cillizza at The Washington Post. The leaked video could be a turning point for Team Romney, "the wake-up call it needs to sharpen" its message. He has about two weeks to use this "bad September" as the foundation for a strong October.

391	mitt-romneys-strategy-win-virginia-lyme-disease-162000153--election	The image: The Weekly Standard reports that voters in Virginia are starting to receive their first mailers from the Romney campaign — and the top issue isn't the lackluster economy or the bloated budget deficit, but Lyme Disease. (See an image of the full mailer here.) "It's a disease that begins from a small bug," reads the mailer. "But Lyme Disease has quickly become the most common vector-borne disease in the United States." The mailer, which describes Lyme Disease as a "massive epidemic threatening Virginia," promises that a President Romney would take action to bring the disease under control. The mailer is apparently part of Romney's micro-targeting strategy, which seeks to engage voters on the local issues they care most about.The reaction: Well, "it's tough to micro-target any deeper than a mailer talking about ticks," says Tim Murphy at Mother Jones. But remember, Virginia is an immensely important battleground state where Romney needs to establish his bona fides on the economy and other presidential-level issues. Indeed, a micro-targeting campaign won't be much use to Romney, says Josh Kraushaar at National Journal, since he "badly needs an overarching vision that appeals to Americans dissatisfied with Obama's performance in office and struggling in a stagnant economy."View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	3	4	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	3	2	1	2	3	3
392	mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Advocates for people who engage in rough but consensual sex say they fear an abuse case unfolding in Missouri ultimately could criminalize their lifestyle.Ed Bagley faces a federal trial early next year on 11 counts of abuse against a woman who authorities say he groomed to be his sex slave. Now prosecutors plan to present consensual, though violent, acts between Bagley and his own wife as evidence that Bagley has a history of sexually assaulting women.The case will include evidence of "sadistic sexual assaults" committed by Bagley against his wife, Marilyn, prosecutors say."Marilyn Bagley's 'consent' to the sexual assaults by Defendant Edward Bagley does not change whether the acts legally constitute assault or not. Pursuant to the Missouri state assault statute ... consent is not a defense to assault resulting in serious physical injury," prosecutors wrote in court documents filed last month.Some worry the government's assertion could open up people who practice bondage, dominance, sadism and masochism — or BDSM — to criminal charges for consensual acts they're already performing, said Susan Wright, founder of the Baltimore-based National Coalition for Sexual Freedom."We are following this case specifically because we were hoping this issue would not come up," she said.Ed Bagley, 45, of Lebanon, Mo., is accused of grooming a young woman to be his sex slave starting in 2002, then keeping her captive for years while making money from her images on fetish Internet sites and forcing her to work as a dancer at strip clubs. Marilyn Bagley, 47, is charged with five counts, including sex trafficking and forced labor trafficking.Both have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial in February.Prosecutors claim Bagley, known as "Master Ed," tortured the young woman and made her available to other men who came to his trailer, either to torture or have sex with her. Four men, who said they visited Bagley's trailer to watch or take part, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges.The case came to light in early 2009 after the woman, then 23, was hospitalized after what prosecutors said was a torture session. Then-U.S. Attorney Beth Phillips called the case one of "the most horrific ever prosecuted in this district."Advocates for the BDSM community say even the most brutal acts detailed in Bagley's federal indictment are not criminal acts, as long as there was consent. But if the woman was too young or not intelligent enough to consent, as prosecutors allege, or if she initially gave consent and then changed her mind, most who spoke with the AP said that would be criminal sexual abuse.It's the inclusion of Bagley's acts with his wife in the case that concerns BDSM advocates and Bagley's attorney, Susan Dill."Like many people from all walks of life, my client and his wife engaged in what some might term alternative, but nonetheless, consensual sexual activity that they both enjoyed," Dill said in an email to The Associated Press. "The assertion that their consensual, marital sex life is evidence of prior criminal activity is nonsensical."As in several other states, Missouri assault laws limit instances in which consent can be used as a defense against criminal charges when serious injuries occur. Exceptions generally are made for athletic activities and the victim's occupation or professions in which the conduct and harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards.Wright's group contends "serious physical injury" is not well-defined under law."The assessment of the seriousness of harm is often affected by judges' 'moral judgments about the iniquity of the conduct,'" the organization says on its website in a section focusing on the consent issue. "Courts tend to inflate the risk and harmfulness of an activity they want to denounce. For example, any injury caused during a sadomasochistic encounter has been consistently classified as serious."Diana Adams, a New York attorney and sexual freedom activist who represents clients in alternative lifestyles, said the landmark 2003 U.S. Supreme Court ruling "Lawrence v. Texas" that struck down a Texas anti-sodomy law "declared we had a right to consensual sex between adults in the privacy of our own homes," but that the law is not clearly defined."In this kind of case, sometimes it's selectively applied," Adams said.She said federal courts in Texas and Alabama interpreted the Lawrence decision in different ways in 2004. The Texas court used the case to strike down a ban on sales of sex toys, citing Lawrence's privacy conclusion. The Alabama court, however, upheld a similar ban by saying commercial sale of the toys was an issue of obscenity, not privacy.Wright notes that regardless of the legal precedent, prosecutors' attempts to present acts between Bagley and his wife as evidence in the Missouri case also comes at a time when kinky sex practices appear to be gaining broader public acceptance amid the popularity of the E.L. James "50 Shades of Grey" bondage books."Because of '50 Shades of Grey,' a lot of people are trying BDSM for the first time this year," she said. "We want to be sure they understand they have to do these activities consensually, and to make sure they have the skill to do them safely."	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	1	3	3	4
393	modern-family-races-lead-emmy-awards-005738210	LOS ANGELES (AP) — What is "Two and a Half Men" with Jon Cryer and without Charlie Sheen? Really good was the Emmy Awards verdict Sunday as Cryer claimed the best comedy actor trophy."Don't panic, people. Something has clearly gone terribly wrong. I'm stunned," said Cryer, who on the red carpet before the show has expressed confidence he wouldn't win. Among others, he beat out two-time winner Jim Parsons of "The Big Bang Theory."Ashton Kutcher, who joined the show after Sheen was fired, wasn't nominated.Julia Louis-Dreyfus was honored as best actress in comedy for "Veep.""Modern Family" made it look easy as the comedy's Eric Stonestreet and Julie Bowen claimed supporting actor awards.Stonestreet was funny and touching as he accepted the best supporting actor award for his role as half of a devoted gay couple on "Modern Family.""I wouldn't be standing here without Jesse Tyler Ferguson, there is no Cam without Mitch," he said, saluting his co-star. "We get the awesome opportunity to play these two characters on TV and show America and the world what a loving couple we can be just like everybody else."Then he turned saucy: "I never knew I'd be on TV as a gay man, but I love the pictures of hairy chests you guys are sending me, it's really amazing. Thank you for those."Bowen got a huge shout-out from castmate Sofia Vergara."Oh, that's my Sofia, God bless you. ... This is an embarrassment of riches," Bowen said.The show started with bathroom humor: A filmed bit with Kathy Bates, Zooey Deschanel and other nominated actresses prepping in the restroom, then discovering a weeping Jimmy Kimmel lamenting a Botox reaction he said would keep him off stage as host."You look beautiful," he was reassured. "You look like a 'Real Housewife.'"Viewers of the skit may have been puzzled by a nude Lena Dunham, the creator-star of "Girls," who's routinely brave about showing skin on the HBO comedy.Standup comic Louis C.K. won the Emmy Award for best comedy writing for "Louis C.K."HBO came into the night with a leading 17 creative arts Emmys from a Sept. 15 ceremony honoring technical and other achievements. CBS was second with 13, followed by PBS with 11. Discovery received six awards, NBC got five and ABC and the Cartoon Network won four each. Fox received two trophies.Emmy has to prove herself a winner with the audience. After rebounding somewhat to 13.5 million viewers in 2010 after an all-time low in 2008 of 12.3 million, last year's show drew 12.4 million viewers airing on Fox. The ceremony rotates annually among the four major networks.	3	4	3	2	3	2	2	3	2	2	4	2	3	1	2	3

395	moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804	ST. LOUIS (AP) — With a string of gold albums, a hit TV series and the signature "Moon River," Andy Williams was a voice of the 1960s, although not the '60s we usually hear about."The old cliche says that if you can remember the 1960s, you weren't there," the singer once recalled. "Well, I was there all right, but my memory of them is blurred — not by any drugs I took but by the relentless pace of the schedule I set myself."Williams' plaintive tenor, boyish features and easy demeanor helped him outlast many of the rock stars who had displaced him and such fellow crooners as Frank Sinatra and Perry Como. He remained on the charts into the 1970s, and continued to perform in his 80s at the Moon River Theatre he built in Branson, Mo.In November 2011, when Williams announced that he had been diagnosed with bladder cancer, he vowed to return to performing the following year: His 75th in show business.Williams died Tuesday night at his home in Branson following a yearlong battle with the disease, his Los Angeles-based publicist, Paul Shefrin, said Wednesday. He was 84.He became a major star the same year as Elvis Presley, 1956, with the Sinatra-like swing "Canadian Sunset," and for a time he was pushed into such Presley imitations as "Lips of Wine" and the No. 1 smash "Butterfly."But he mostly stuck to what he called his "natural style," and kept it up throughout his career. In 1970, when even Sinatra had given up and (temporarily) retired, Williams was in the top 10 with the theme from "Love Story," the Oscar-winning tearjerker. He had 18 gold records and three platinum, was nominated for five Grammy awards and hosted the Grammy ceremonies for several years.Movie songs became a specialty, from "Love Story" and "Days of Wine and Roses" to "Moon River." The longing Johnny Mercer-Henry Mancini ballad was his most famous song, even though he never released it as a single because his record company feared such lines as "my huckleberry friend" were too confusing and old-fashioned for teens.The song was first performed by Audrey Hepburn in the beloved 1961 film "Breakfast at Tiffany's," but Mancini thought "Moon River" ideal for Williams, who recorded it in "pretty much one take" and also sang it at the 1962 Academy Awards. Although "Moon River" was covered by countless artists and became a hit single for Jerry Butler, Williams made the song his personal brand. In fact, he insisted on it."When I hear anybody else sing it, it's all I can to do stop myself from shouting at the television screen, 'No! That's my song!'" Williams wrote in his 2009 memoir, titled, fittingly, "Moon River and Me.""The Andy Williams Show," which lasted in various formats through the 1960s and into 1971, won three Emmys and featured Williams alternately performing his stable of hits and bantering casually with his guest stars.It was on that show that Williams — who launched his own career as part of an all-brother quartet — introduced the world to another clean-cut act — the original four singing Osmond Brothers of Utah. Their younger sibling Donny also made his debut on Williams' show, in 1963 when he was 6 years old. Four decades later, the Osmonds and Williams would find themselves in close proximity again, sharing Williams' theater in Branson.Williams did book some rock and soul acts, including the Beach Boys, the Temptations and Smokey Robinson. On one show, in 1970, Williams sang "Heaven Help Us All" with Ray Charles, Mama Cass and a then-little known Elton John, a vision to Williams in his rhinestone glasses and black cape. But Williams liked him and his breakthrough hit "Your Song" enough to record it himself.Williams' act was, apparently, not an act. The singer's unflappable manner on television and in concert was mirrored offstage."I guess I've never really been aggressive, although almost everybody else in show business fights and gouges and knees to get where they want to be," he once said. "My trouble is, I'm not constructed temperamentally along those linesHis wholesome image endured one jarring interlude. In 1976, his ex-wife, former Las Vegas showgirl Claudine Longet, shot and killed her lover, skiing champion Spider Sabich. The Rolling Stones mocked the tragedy in "Claudine," a song so pitiless that it wasn't released until decades later. Longet, who said it was an accident, spent only a week in jail. Williams stood by her. He escorted her to the courthouse, testified on her behalf and provided support for her and their children, Noelle, Christian and Robert.Also in the 1970s, Williams was seen frequently in the company of Ethel Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's widow. The singer denied any romantic involvement.He was born Howard Andrew Williams in Wall Lake, Iowa, on Dec. 3, 1927. In his memoir, Williams remembered himself as a shy boy who concealed his insecurity "behind a veneer of cheek and self-confidence." Of Wall Lake, Williams joked that it was so small, and had so little to do, that crowds would gather just to watch someone get a haircut.Williams began performing with his older brothers Dick, Bob and Don in the local Presbyterian church choir. Their father, postal worker and insurance man Jay Emerson Williams, was the choirmaster and the force behind his children's career.When Andy was 8, Williams' father brought the kids for an audition on Des Moines radio station WHO's Iowa Barn Dance. They were initially turned down, but Jay Emerson Williams and the young quartet kept returning and they were finally accepted, their show bringing them attention from Chicago, Cincinnati and Hollywood. Another star at WHO was a young sportscaster named Ronald Reagan, who would later praise Williams as a "national treasure."The brothers joined Bing Crosby in recording the hit "Swinging on a Star" in 1944 for Crosby's film "Going My Way," and Andy, barely a teenager, was picked to dub Lauren Bacall's voice on a song for the film "To Have and Have Not." His voice stayed in the film until the preview, when it was cut because it didn't sound like Bacall's.Later the brothers worked with Kay Thompson of eventual "Eloise" fame, then a singer who had taken a position as vocal coach at MGM studios, working with Judy Garland, June Allyson and others. After three months of training, Thompson and the Williams Brothers broke in their show at the El Rancho Room in Las Vegas to a huge ovation. They drew rave reviews in New York, Los Angeles and across the nation, earning a peak of $25,000 a week.Williams, analyzing their success, once said: "Somehow we managed to work up and sustain an almost unbearable pitch of speed and rhythm."After five years, the three older brothers, who were starting their own families, had tired of the constant travel and left to pursue other careers.Williams initially struggled as a solo act and was so broke at one point that he resorted to eating food intended for his two dogs."I had no money for food, so I ate it," he recalled in 2001, "and it actually was damned good."A two-year TV stint on Steve Allen's "Tonight Show" and a contract with Cadence Records turned things around. In the 1960s. Williams later formed his own label, Barnaby Records, which released music by the Everly Brothers, Ray Stevens and Jimmy Buffett.Williams was a lifelong Republican who once accused President Obama of "following Marxist theory." But he acknowledged experimenting with LSD, opposed the Nixon administration's efforts in the 1970s to deport John Lennon, and, in 1968, was an energetic supporter of Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign. When Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles in June 1968, just after winning the California Democratic primary, Williams sang "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" at his funeral."We chose that song because he used it on the campaign trail," Williams later said of Kennedy, who had been a close friend. "He had a terrible voice but he loved to sing that song. The only way I got through singing in church that day was by saying, 'This is my job. I can't let emotion get in the way of the song.' I really concentrated on not thinking about him."After leaving TV, Williams headed back on the road, where his many Christmas shows and albums made him a huge draw during the holidays. One year in Des Moines, however, a snowstorm kept the customers away, and the band's equipment failed to reach Chicago in time for the next night's show, forcing the musicians to borrow instruments from a high school band."No more tours," Williams decreed.He decided to settle in Branson, the self-proclaimed "live entertainment capital of the country," with its dozens of theaters featuring live music, comedy and magic acts.When he arrived in 1992, the town was dominated by country music performers, but Williams changed that, building the classy, $13 million Andy Williams Moon River Theater in the heart of the city's entertainment district and performing two shows a night, six days a week, nine months of the year. Only in recent years did he begin to cut back to one show a night.Not surprisingly, his most popular time of the year was Christmas, although he acknowledged that not everyone in Hollywood accepted his move to the Midwest."The fact is most of my friends in L.A. still think I'm nuts for coming here," he told The Associated Press in 1998.He and his second wife, the former Debbie Haas, divided their time between homes in Branson and Palm Springs, where he spent his leisure hours on the golf course when Branson's theaters were dark during the winter months following Christmas.Retirement was not on his schedule. As he told the AP in 2001: "I'll keep going until I get to the point where I can't get out on stage."Williams is survived by his wife, Debbie, and his three children, Robert, Noelle and Christian.___Thomas reported from Los Angeles.

396	more-schoolkids-nonmedical-exemptions-vaccines-225718382	The percentage of school children obtaining exemptions from required vaccinations for nonmedical reasons is increasing, a new report says.In 2011, just over 2 percent of school children were exempt from getting their vaccines for nonmedical reasons, up from about 1 percent in 2006, the report found."Our results show that nonmedical exemptions have continued to increase, and the rate of increase has accelerated," in recent years, the researchers at Emory University wrote in a letter published today (Sept. 20) in the New England Journal of Medicine.All U.S. states allow children to be exempt from vaccination requirements for medical reasons — some children are allergic to vaccines, others have conditions that severely compromise their immune systems, and could make vaccination dangerous to a child's health.In addition, 48 states allow exemptions for nonmedical reasons (Mississippi and West Virginia do not). Nonmedical exemptions can be granted for religious reasons or philosophical reasons, though fewer states allow philosophical exemptions than religious ones.For their report, researchers used data on vaccine exemptions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for school years 2005–2006 through 2010–2011.They found that the rates of nonmedical exemptions were 2.5 times higher in states that allowed philosophical exemptions, compared with states that allowed only religious exemptions.However, the rate of exemptions was rising faster in states that allowed only religious exemptions, the report said.The researchers also looked at state exemption rates in terms of how difficult exemptions are for parents to get — some states use a standardized form to request exemptions and make this form available at schools, others require parents to go though the state health department, or require a specifically worded letter or notarization.Over the study period, the exemption rates were higher in states with "easy" exemption policies, compared with states with "difficult" policies. In 2011, the average exemption rate in states with easy policies was 3.3. percent, while it was 1.3 percent in states with difficult policies."In an earlier analysis of data from 1991 through 2004, we found an increase in exemption rates only in states with philosophical exemptions and in states with easy exemption procedures," the researchers said.Pass it on: More schoolchildren are opting out of required vaccinations, a new study says.FollowMyHealthNewsDaily on Twitter @MyHealth_MHND.

397	morsi-wants-free-speech-joined-responsibility-212613394	NEW YORK (AP) — Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, the country's first democratically elected leader, says freedom of expression must be joined with responsibility in a speech that addressed the violent clashes that erupted across the Muslim world in reaction to an anti-Islam video produced in the United States.Morsi, a key figure in the Muslim Brotherhood, was speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York on Tuesday. He did not outline what limitations he believes should be imposed on free speech. The new Egyptian leader addresses the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.He condemned the violent acts of some demonstrators. Dozens of people, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, have been killed since protests began last week after excerpts of the anti-Islam video were dubbed into Arabic and posted onto YouTube.	2	2	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	1	2	1	1	2	2	
398	mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651	For the first time, scientists have peered to the edge of a colossal black hole and measured the point of no return for matter.A black hole has a boundary called an event horizon. Anything that falls within a black hole's event horizon — be it stars, gas, or even light — can never escape."Once objects fall through the event horizon, they're lost forever," Shep Doeleman, assistant director of the MIT Haystack Observatory and research associate at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, said in a statement Thursday (Sept. 27). "It's an exit door from our universe. You walk through that door, you’re not coming back."Although the event horizon is an imaginary line that's impossible to observe, astronomers have imaged the region around a giant black hole at the center of a distant galaxy, and measured, for the first time, the closest stable orbit in which matter can circle the black hole. The findings were reported today in the journal Science.The supermassive black hole in question lies at the center of the galaxy M87, which is about 50 million light-years from our own Milky Way. This behemoth black hole contains the mass of 6 billion suns.Using a new observatory called the Event Horizon Telescope, which links up radio dishes in Hawaii, Arizona and California, astronomers measured that the innermost possible orbit for matter around the black hole is roughly 5.5 times the size of the black hole's event horizon.This innermost orbit is about five times the size of the solar system, or 750 times the distance from Earth to the sun, Doeleman told SPACE.com. The distance between the Earth and the sun is nearly 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).The observations allowed the researchers to confirm that this swirling mass around the black hole is the source of the powerful jets of light seen radiating from the galaxy. Many galaxies throughout the universe spot similar jets, thought to be produced by matter falling into their central black holes. Until now, no telescope has had the resolution power to verify the idea.The Event Horizon Telescope is a new project that aims to link as many as 50 radio dishes around the world to work in concert to image the distant universe. Already, the observatory can see celestial objects with 2,000 times more detail than the Hubble Space Telescope.You can follow SPACE.com on Twitter @Spacedotcom.

399	mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance	PEMBA, Mozambique (Reuters) - It was billed as a celebration of its socialist revolution, but when Mozambique's ruling Frelimo party marked its 50th birthday this week, Marx came a distant second to Money.Reflecting their anti-colonial, revolutionary roots, Frelimo leaders pointedly chose a venue in the untamed corner of southern Africa where half a century ago guerrillas launched the uprising that would lead to independence from Portugal in 1975.But beyond the symbolism of the location, in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, the obligatory use of "Comrade" and the AK-47 rifle that still adorns the national flag, everything at the party congress pointed to the huge wealth accruing to the political elite in the fast-growing energy producer.The venue itself was a lavish complex of VIP reception rooms and cavernous dining areas, set amid a village of apartment units, two on-site banks and a hospital clinic for 2,000 guests.Just to the north lies the Rovuma Basin, where U.S. energy firm Anadarko and Italy's Eni are exploring some of the world's biggest untapped natural gas reserves - an estimated 130 trillion cubic feet, or enough to supply Western Europe for over a decade.To some of Mozambique's 23 million people, the talk of "revolutionary war" by Frelimo leader and President Armando Guebuza - known as "Mr. Guebusiness" on account of his huge commercial interests - rings hollow."It is absurd to spend $8 million on a week-long conference when people are starving a block away," said Rudiger Franck, a hotel owner and Frelimo party member in Pemba, the run-down seaside town that hosted the seven-day jamboree."It gives the impression that the party has lost touch with the reality of life for most of its members."MINING BOOMUnder its first president, U.S.-educated sociologist Eduardo Mondlane, Frelimo struck out on a Marxist course until 1990 when, tired from civil war and under growing pressure from the West, it renounced socialism.In the last decade, mostly under Guebuza, Mozambique has become a hotbed of foreign mining investment that has lifted economic growth to 7 percent a year and in 2011 made its currency the strongest performer against the dollar.Brazil's Vale , for instance, has poured $2 billion into a coal mine in the northwestern region of Moatize and plans to invest $6.4 billion in the years to come.Frelimo says all Mozambicans stand to benefit, yet in a country where the average person scrapes by on $400 a year, the opulence of its congress sends a conflicting message."This money never reaches the people. It remains in Frelimo's pocket," said Mustagibo Bachir, a Cabo Delgado member of parliament for Renamo, Frelimo's foe during a 16-year post-independence civil war.Bachir sees a worrying precedent in the handling of the ruby and timber sectors in the north, which remains one of the country's poorest regions."Our people still don't have access to water, food or jobs," he said.Besides Renamo, Frelimo is also facing opposition from the upstart Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), run by the 48-year-old mayor of Beira, Mozambique's second city with a population of half a million people.Analysts say elections due in 2014 are too soon for MDM to make serious headway, but point to its popularity with young, educated and unemployed Mozambicans as a sign that it could become a force to be reckoned with later in the decade.	3	4	3	3	4	4	2	3	3	2	3	2	2	3	3	4
400	mozambiques-cashews-dose-dutch-disease-130512871--sector	MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique's cashew industry is ailing, and the symptoms point to a bad bout of "Dutch disease."In a nutshell, this illness strikes an economy when the discovery of a resource such as oil draws in a flood of dollars, boosting the local currency but making all other exports uncompetitive.The term was coined to explain the decline of manufacturing in the Netherlands after the discovery of North Sea oil and gas in the late 1950s.In Mozambique's case, an investment boom in the nascent coal and gas sectors hoisted the metical by a whopping 33 percent against the dollar from September 2010 to the end of 2011. It has since held on to the bulk of those gains.Foreign direct investment soared to $2.1 billion last year - when the metical was the top-performing currency against the dollar - compared with just $7.8 million in 2010, central bank data showed.While the government will welcome the money, it has crushed any cashew comeback and put the livelihood of tens of thousands of peasant farmers at risk in a country where agriculture still accounts for a third of gross domestic product.The tropical southeast African nation and former Portuguese colony was once the world's top producer of the coveted nuts, but - as with most of its economy - the industry was gutted when civil war erupted after independence in 1975.The end of conflict two decades ago allowed the cashew sector to sprout anew, and in 2010, sales rose to a post-war peak of 113,000 tonnes, the third-highest in Africa behind Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau, according to the Ghana-based African Cashew Alliance.But sales then tumbled to 63,000 tonnes last year.Market and industry players say the currency's appreciation prompted buyers in India, where most of Mozambique's cashews are processed, to search for cheaper options elsewhere."Prices last year got to all time highs and that really hurts demand," said Richard Rosenblatt, of the Richard Franco Agency, a U.S.-based nut broker.Oil-rich Angola, another former Portuguese colony on the other side of Africa, also highlights the impact of Dutch disease on agriculture.Before independence in 1975 and the chaos of its civil war, Angola was the world's fourth-largest coffee producer, churning out 200,000 tonnes of beans a year.Now, a decade after the fighting ended, it is vying with Nigeria to be Africa's biggest oil producer, while its coffee industry remains in a rut with annual output of a paltry 4,000 tonnes.One solution being explored in Mozambique is to process its cashew nuts at home."The cashew nut is consumed externally so it is the international price that dictates things," said Filomena Maiopue, director of the National Cashew Institute in the capital, Maputo."We've reached the conclusion, in discussion with the Ministry of Agriculture, that in order to minimize that effect, we need to intensify local processing," said Maiopue.Even if the government does get its act together, there is little immediate relief in store for farmers as money continues to pour in from mining giants such as Brazil's Vale to develop the Mozambique's vast coal fields.Joaquin Solomon Nhantumo, a farmer in southern Mozambique, has been forced him to grow lettuce and tomatoes in his back-yard orchard to provide for himself and his eight children.But he says there is only one crop that will keep him in business in the long run."The cashew nut is our sole means of survival."	4	3	3	3	4	2	2	3	3	2	3	1	1	2	3	4
401	much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957	Centre College in Danville, Ky. is home to this year's vice presidential debate. With thousands of attendees, campaign staff and reporters -- and all of their smartphones, tablets, laptops and other connected gear -- descending on campus Oct. 11, it takes impressive technology and a coordinated effort to keep the data running smoothly.[More from Mashable: Our iPhones Are Depleting the Earth’s Resources [INFOGRAPHIC]]To give an idea of the challenge, the college's IT crew is expecting approximately 1,500-2,000 wireless-connected devices at any given time, with an average 2.5 wireless devices per attendee -- and that doesn't count the computers and other equipment that calls for a hardline connection. It's also, the team admits, an estimation."Bandwidth is a big guess," said Shane Wilson, coordinator of Network Services at Centre College. "The only data we have is from 2008, and that's basically ancient history. We feel very confident about 2 gigabits of bandwidth."[More from Mashable: Behind the Social Media Campaigns of Obama and Romney]How is the college preparing to deliver problem-free data connections?To make sure there's enough bandwidth to go around, Centre College will be temporarily expanding its Internet connection from 250 megabits to 2 gigabits. That's an eightfold increase using two single-gigabit links running simultaneously. Mobile providers are also bringing in trucks to help boost the mobile phone and data signals in the immediate area.And what about network problems? For network engineers concerned about stability during a high-traffic event, redundancy is the name of the game. Accordingly, Centre Network worked with several vendors to set up a temporary network that's running separate from the campus network.The new network is fully redundant with four routers, multiple backbone links and multiple core paths, giving Centre College's IT staff the ability to quickly adapt is something goes wrong on debate day.There's also a power redundancy -- the debate hall is run on a diesel generator, but it can be quickly switched to standard line power if there's a problem (it's quicker to switch from diesel to electric than vice-versa). And like a military tanker jet high above a field of combat, diesel gas trucks will be waiting nearby in case they need to refuel.And what if something goes wrong on the provider side, like physical damage to fiber? The college's staff will have support cases with CISCO, AT&T and Time Warner Cable open in advance, drastically speeding up any necessary repairs. AT&T and Time Warner will also have trained technicians on site, ready to go in case of an emergency -- think of them as network first responders.With so many connected devices, security is surely a concern. Centre College's staff says they'll be using separate VLAN SSID networks for each of the campaigns as well for the media and other major groups involved with the debate. Each network will use encrypted 802.11x to help keep the campaigns from spying on one another's traffic and the media from spying on the campaigns' traffic.Will it all work? On Thursday afternoon, Centre College invited about 120 faculty, staff and students to help test the network and look for problems. A few were found and quickly fixed -- a result that built confidence among the Centre College team."We discovered problems and corrected them -- and that was the goal," said Wilson. "I feel much better than if everything had gone smoothly. If that happened, I would've wondered what was left uncovered."The tech involved in running a nationally-televised debate has drastically changed in the last 12 years, said Art Moore, Centre College's director of information technology services. Moore was at the college when it hosted the 2000 vice presidential debate between Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman."The world completely has changed in the last 12 years, when it was all about analog telephone lines," said Moore. "The media then was doing dial-up to get Internet access. We provided phone lines... and gave one data line each to the campaign workspaces. We didn't even have laptops in 2000."Images courtesy of Flickr, Center for American Progress Action Fund, Gage SkidmoreThis story originally published on Mashable here.	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	3	2	4	3	1	1	1	3	4
402	murdoch-paper-hacking-plot-trial-set-next-140904191	LONDON (Reuters) - Two former editors of Rupert Murdoch-owned newspapers who had close ties to British Prime Minister David Cameron will face trial late next year at the earliest on charges related to alleged phone-hacking, a court heard on Wednesday.Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson were among 13 suspects who appeared in court, accused either of conspiring to intercept the voicemail messages of more than 600 people or hindering the police investigation into those claims.The hearing - at London's Central Criminal Court, known as the Old Bailey - only dealt with administrative matters, not the substance of the allegations. All 13 suspects heard the proposed date for their trial had been set for September 9, 2013.The hacking scandal has damaged the reputation of Murdoch's global media operations, raised questions about Cameron's judgment and exposed the close relations between British politicians, police and journalists.Brooks and Coulson were both once editors of the News of the World, a Sunday tabloid that Murdoch abruptly shut down in July 2011 because of allegations that some of its journalists had hacked the phones of celebrities, politicians and crime victims.By that time, Brooks had been promoted to chief executive of News International, Murdoch's British newspaper business, and was a confidante to the media mogul and a close friend to successive British prime ministers including Cameron.After leaving the News of the World, Coulson was hired by Cameron, then in opposition, to be his communications chief. Cameron took Coulson into government with him but Coulson later resigned.None of the accused in the hacking case has yet entered a plea though Brooks and Coulson have indicated they will deny the accusations.PACKED COURTThe dock at the Old Bailey's wood-paneled Court One, where some of Britain's most notorious criminals have gone on trial, was so full that several of the suspects had to sit on adjacent benches.Eighteen lawyers in wigs and black gowns, including some of the country's top defense counsel, looked on. Brooks, instantly recognizable with her mane of long red curls was wearing a beige jacket and spoke only to confirm her presence, as did the other suspects.Joining Coulson and Brooks in the dock were some of the most senior former staff from the News of the World who have been charged with conspiracy to intercept voicemails.Brooks is also charged, with six others, including her husband Charlie, with conspiring to hinder police investigating the alleged phone-hacking by concealing material from them. Charlie Brooks, a wealthy racehorse trainer, is an old friend of Cameron's who went to the same exclusive private school.Tight restrictions were imposed on the reporting of the hearing which decided on a timetable for evidence to be disclosed. The court was told that the next hearing for the cases would be on December 12 and 13.(Reporting by Michael Holden and Peter Griffiths; Editing by Andrew Osborn)	2	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	3	2	3	2	1	3	3	4
403	myanmar-president-heads-u-seeks-end-sanctions-213657263--business	(Reuters) - Myanmar's reformist president heads to the United States this week, keen to win an end to sanctions and open a new chapter in a once frosty relationship that could bring economic and geostrategic benefits to both sides.After feting Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Washington last week, the United States will welcome Thein Sein, a 67-year-old former general who emerged as the unlikely catalyst for a wave of reforms that were unthinkable a year ago.Thein Sein's U.S. visit, the first by a Myanmar leader in 46 years, is the strongest sign yet of rapprochement between the two countries -- something that will benefit not only the cash-starved southeast Asian nation, but could help a superpower intent on boosting its political and economic muscle in a booming region.U.S. aid to Myanmar could resume at some point and the Treasury Department on Wednesday removed individual sanctions against Thein Sein, the latest let-up in the tight restrictions that isolated his country for two decades, squeezed its tattered economy and pushed it closer into China's orbit.Congress last week approved a bill that would allow President Barack Obama to waive a ban on U.S. participation in providing development loans from international financial institutions like the World Bank to the former British colony.But crucial to Thein Sein, who leaves Myanmar on Monday to address the U.N. General Assembly in New York, is the removal of a U.S. ban on Burmese imports, which could pave the way for greater foreign investment and create urgently needed jobs.The European Union set the pace last week in agreeing to grant Myanmar access to its Generalised System of Preferences, a scheme that allows poorer countries access to European markets without quotas or duties.Presidential adviser Ko Ko Hlaing, who a diplomatic source said helped smooth the path for Thein Sein's visit, said ending the embargoes would facilitate the kind of reforms the United States has been asking for."(The visit) is certainly intended to have some relaxation of restrictions and sanctions," Ko Ko Hlaing told Reuters. "Because they happen now to be obstacles in our reform process."CASE TO END SANCTIONSSuu Kyi is also in tune on sanctions with Thein Sein, the former fourth-in-command of the junta that locked her up for 15 years. She received the highest congressional medal on Wednesday and praised the president's reforms, adding Myanmar no longer needed to "depend on U.S. sanctions to keep up the momentum".She met Obama on Wednesday. It is not known if he would also meet his Myanmar counterpart, as recommended by Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, which said a decision not to risked being seen as unbalanced and "a failure to appreciate the courageous role" he has played.Thein Sein has sought to build a strong case for Washington to slash sanctions and deepen engagement with a country the Bush administration dubbed an "outpost of tyranny" while under the rule of reclusive generals, who viewed the U.S. with suspicion.Thein Sein gave amnesty last week to nearly 90 political prisoners, and sent charismatic president's office minister Aung Min to the United States to showcase peace efforts with ethnic minority rebel groups.But it is not just Myanmar which stands to gain. The country also known as Burma is of strategic importance to Washington in terms of its geographical location, business potential and its decades-old alliance with China.Sanctions on Myanmar allowed China to command huge influence there and experts say closer U.S. engagement serves Washington's unspoken goal of containing China by cosying up to poorer Southeast Asian countries with close ties to Beijing.As one of Asia's last untapped frontier markets and with a population of 60 million, Myanmar also offers corporate America plentiful opportunities in energy, extractive industries, financial services, retail, hotels and tourism. PepsiCo Inc, Coca-Cola and GE have already set up."It's a win-win situation for both countries and a chance to show the damage from the past can be repaired. It's therefore crucial Presidents Obama and Thein Sein meet," said Aung Thu Nyein of the Vahu Development Institute, a Myanmar think-tank."Burma needs Washington's help, it fits in with the new U.S. Asia policy and there's much U.S. firms can do in Burma."(Reporting by Martin Petty in Bangkok; Additional reporting by Jason Szep in Naypyitaw; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)	4	3	4	4	3	3	3	4	3	2	3	3	3	2	4	4
404	nadine-wont-die-storm-becomes-one-10-longest-195313432	Nadine was born, declared to be over, came back from the dead and just keeps sticking around.And now, the cyclone's longevity will earn it a spot in the record books: By tonight, it will become the Atlantic Ocean's 10th longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). A tropical cyclone is an organized storm with winds greater than 32 mph (52 kph), and includes tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes.Nadine is expected to retain tropical cyclone strength for another three to four days, in which case it could become one of the top five longest-lasting cyclones, said Dennis Feltgen, an NHC spokesman.The longest-lasting Atlantic cyclone ever was the San Ciriaco Hurricane of 1899, which hung on for 28 days. Nadine, which has been a cyclone for 19 days, is not expected to challenge that record, Feltgen told OurAmazingPlanet. [50 Amazing Hurricane Facts]Nadine has had an interesting life. Forecasters issued the first advisory for the storm on the morning of Tuesday, Sept. 11. Three days later, at 11 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14, the storm became the eighth hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season. Exactly one week later, at 11 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 21, forecasters at the NHC declared that Tropical Storm Nadine was no more.Yet forecasters suspected the storm wasn't finished, writing that it could regenerate. And indeed, Nadine did spring back to life like a meteorological zombie, and was declared to be a tropical storm again on Sunday, Sept. 23. On Sept. 28, it was again declared a hurricane.It weakened because it encountered surface waters cooler than 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius), and ingested colder, drier air, both of which slow down storms and disrupt the convection that fuels them. But it picked up when it re-encountered warmer waters and began reorganizing, Feltgen said. It's not unusual for storms to weaken and strengthen again, although it doesn't usually happen this far north.Today (Oct. 1), Nadine was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, defined as being a rotating, organized storm with maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph). Nadine currently packs maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph) and is churning away about 690 miles (1,110 kilometers) west of the Azores. It doesn't present any immediate threat to people on land.Nadine has been a tropical storm for the seventh longest amount of time in the history of the Atlantic Ocean basin, Feltgen said. The longest-lasting storm in any ocean basin was John, which began life as a hurricane in the East Pacific basin, then moved to the Northwest Pacific and was renamed as a typhoon. That storm survived for 31 days in August and September 1994.Reach Douglas Main at dmain@techmedianetwork.com. Follow him on Twitter @Douglas_Main. Follow OurAmazingPlanet on Twitter @OAPlanet.

It noted that if the proposal is not approved, the applicable limit of liability under the approved rule would instead be $500,000 - less than 1 percent of the proposed pool.Nasdaq's plan to offer $62 million in cash was an increase from an earlier $40 million payback fund, which was made up mostly of trading rebates.Nasdaq defended its use of a 45-minute window to determine a benchmark reference price to assess the amount owed on orders qualifying for accommodation.The company said the time frame "should have been ample time for a reasonably diligent member to identify any unexpected losses or unanticipated positions and take steps to mitigate or liquidate them."The eight-page letter was signed by Nasdaq Senior Vice President and Corporate Secretary Joan Conley.(Reporting By Ashley Lau in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)	2	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	1	1	1	2	4

407	navy-officer-faked-own-death-affair-132500204	In August, Navy Cmdr. Michael P. Ward II was given command of his own nuclear submarine — the culmination of a lifelong dream. A week later, he was languishing at a desk job, on his way to an official reprimand for violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice. His offense? Being a really incompetent adulterer, essentially. Ward, a 43-year-old married father, faked his own death to get out of a relationship with his 23-year-old pregnant mistress. Here's the sordid tale of one man's self-defeatingly elaborate plan to end an affair:What do we know about this relationship?According to the Navy's investigation, obtained by the AP Sept. 18 under a Freedom of Information Act request, and the unidentified woman's earlier account in the Connecticut newspaper The Day, Ward (then a Virginia resident) met his lover through an online dating site last October. He initially used the alias Tony Moore, then told her his real name once they met; he claimed he and his wife were separated. He and this new girlfriend hooked up during a visit near her Norfolk, Va., home, and Ward got her pregnant. In July, after he had moved to Connecticut, they met in Washington to discuss the pregnancy. The woman then lost the baby. And then, Ward suddenly "died."SEE ALSO: Good day, bad day: September 17, 2012How did he fake his death?Over email. Using his own account, but posing as a colleague named "Bob," Ward wrote: "He asked me to contact you if this ever happened. I am extremely sorry to tell you that he is gone. We tried everything we could to save him. I cannot say more. I am sorry it has to be this way."And how did he get caught?The woman, with her mother and sister in tow, drove three-and-a-half hours to Ward's Virginia home to offer their condolences. Instead of a grieving family, they found Jon Boyle, the new owner of the Wards' house. "She was very surprised," Boyle tells the AP. "They said they wanted to offer their condolences. I said, 'I don't think he's dead.'" A relative of the mistress then contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. "I don't want revenge here," the woman told The Day in August. "I want everyone to know the truth about Michael. He does not need to be commanding a submarine. He's a deceitful man." On Sept. 5, Ward was slapped with three violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.SEE ALSO: Petty in pinkIs this a fireable offense?Yes. Adultery, not to mention being a jerk — or, in military code, engaging in "conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman" — violate military rules. "The Navy doesn't kid around with its leadership," Rep. Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) tells the AP. "These positions, to command submarines, are very competitive and I think the Navy is right to hold people to the highest standard." Besides, says Nicole Fabian-Weber at The Stir, he sounds like a spineless idiot. Would you really want to put your multimillion-dollar attack sub, much less your life, in the hands of a man undone by his lack of courage to tell his mistress "he just wasn't that into her"?Sources: AP, The Day, Los Angeles Times, Navy Times, NineMSN, The StirSEE ALSO: Pool in the poolView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	4	5	4	5	4	3	3	4	5	2	5	2	2	4	4

414	nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl	DENVER (AP) — The men in stripes have drawn so much attention this season that some interesting developments on the football field have gone largely unnoticed, like a big spike in field goal accuracy.NFL teams combined for a record 2,287 points in the first three weeks of the season thanks to a record 248 touchdowns.Kickers have done their part in this proliferation of points, converting 182 field goal attempts and missing just 15 for a 92.4 percent clip — the best three-week start ever.The three-week mark tends to be a precursor for the entire season, with the final accuracy rate dipping two or three percentage points as the weather gets worse and the pressure rises.That means the record set in 2008 of 84.5 percent could be obliterated this season.The league-wide field goal percentage last season was 82.9 percent, second-highest all-time. Through three weeks last season, the number was 85.8 percent, according to STATS LLC.If this year's figure drops a similar 2.9 percentage points, it would end up at 89.5 percent, an enormous jump, statistically speaking.Denver Broncos kicker Matt Prater, the most accurate kicker in league history from 50 yards and out, said he thinks this year's spike is the culmination of several factors ranging from better athletes to improved coaching and superior training."Guys are just getting better and better," Prater said. "You get guys who are veterans in there and they learn from their mistakes and don't want to repeat them."Yet, it's not just the icy veined veterans who are nailing their kicks.Kickers coming out of college are having immediate success, too, much like the better-prepared rookie quarterbacks who no longer have to bide their time as backups.Heading into this weekend's slate beginning with Thursday night's Cleveland-Baltimore game, the Ravens' Justin Tucker, St. Louis' Greg Zuerlein and Minnesota's Blair Walsh were a combined 22-for-22 with each rookie having kicked at least a 55-yarder.Tucker and Walsh have game-winners already. Tucker's beat New England 31-30 last weekend as time expired and Walsh's came in overtime against Jacksonville after he kicked a 55-yarder as time expired in regulation."There's more camps for kids coming up the ranks now," Prater said. "You can get a good head start on it."During their high school years, both Walsh and Tucker attended kicking camps in California run by Chris Sailer, who kicked for UCLA in the 1990s.Kickers are also in the weight room more, employ specialized training and superior techniques, kick on more favorable surfaces, generally are better coached and are used more effectively and efficiently on game day.They benefit from better athleticism than their predecessors, come almost exclusively from soccer backgrounds, are aided by an increased emphasis on special teams and rule changes, and even by playing some of their games indoors.It all adds up to greater accuracy."Coaches are starting to let more opportunities happen, which will increase the percentage," Walsh said. "I just think guys are really starting to perfect what they do, and you're seeing a lot more great kickers today than you probably did in the past. You'd have a handful of great kickers and the rest would be pretty good, but not elite, but I think there's a ton of elite kickers in the NFL right now."The success rate has risen steadily from all distances, short and long, during the Super Bowl era. In 1967, for instance, barely 51 percent of all field goal attempts were good. Now, nine in 10 are splitting the uprights, which were moved to the back of the end zone in 1974.Back then, kickers were often converted linemen who happened to have strong legs. Now, every kicker in the NFL played soccer as a kid and all employ the soccer-style kick that has improved place-kickers' accuracy over the decades.Hall of Fame kicker Lou "The Toe" Groza made 54.9 percent of his field goal attempts, a percentage that would get him run off the roster today, not enshrined in Canton, Ohio.Kickers aren't just more accurate, but with such parity in the league, they're more important than ever.Through Week 3, 28 games were decided by one score, tied with 1988 for the most such games through the first three weeks. Last weekend, seven games were decided in the final minute of regulation or overtime, something that's happened just once before, in 1995. Five of those came down to a field goal.Among the seven game-winning field goals so far was Tucker's 27-yarder as time expired that gave the Ravens the victory over the New England Patriots last weekend in a rematch of the AFC championship game. In that title game, Billy Cundiff missed a 32-yard field goal in the closing seconds. In the encore, Tucker — who took the job away from Cundiff in training camp — drove his kick just inside the right upright."Bottom line is it went in," Tucker said. "That's all I care about. It went in."Patriots coach Bill Belichick wasn't so sure and he was fined $50,000 this week for grabbing a replacement official's arm after the game as he tried to see if the call was reviewable. It wasn't.Tucker, who beat out Cundiff with a perfect preseason, attributes his success to lessons he received from head coach John Harbaugh, special teams coach Jerry Rosburg and kicking consultant Randy Brown."I feel like I'm kicking the best I ever kicked," Tucker said. "Took a little work, took a couple of days, and now I feel like I'm striking the ball as confidently as I ever have."He's not the only one who feels that way.Prater's three field goals against Houston last week moved him past Jason Elam as the most accurate kicker in team history at 81 percent, and his 53-yarder made him 13 for 17 from 50 yards and out for a 76.5 percent clip, the best in league history with a minimum of 10 attempts.Ryan Succop's club-record sixth field goal gave Kansas City a 27-24 win in overtime at New Orleans last weekend. He was a perfect 6 for 6 on kicks ranging from 25 to 45 yards.Zuerlein, a sixth-round pick out of tiny Missouri Western, is 8 for 8 on field goals, including a 56-yarder last week, one yard shy of the Rams franchise record.What impresses his coaches is his steely resolve that belies his inexperience."I guess I'm just confident in my abilities," Zuerlein said. "I expect to make the kick, so I don't get nervous really."Rams special teams coach John Fassel said he's never worked with a kicker this talented so early in his career: "You see him in the mall, he looks like any other 24-year-old walking around," Fassel said. "But his leg speed is incredible."Zuerlein said years spent playing soccer probably account for his explosive leg power, not anything he does in the weight room."I can't squat a house or anything like that," Zuerlein said. "It's probably about the same amount of weight just an average person might lift."So far this season, there's been nothing ordinary about NFL kickers.___Online: http://pro32.ap.org/poll and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL___AP Pro Football Writer Dave Campbell and AP Sports Writers R.B.

415	nfl-referee-lockout-huge-win-organized-labor-160500722	Following a heinous game-ending call that handed the Seattle Seahawks a victory over the Green Bay Packers on Monday night, everyone seems to agree that the NFL has to resolve a labor dispute with the referees' union that has kept the regular refs on the sidelines. Even President Obama tweeted that "NFL fans on both sides of the aisle hop the refs' lockout is settled soon," while GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin native, is fuming about it on the campaign trail. But perhaps the most surprising response came from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who is famous for trying to repeal collective bargaining rights of public unions in his state. Walker tweeted that the Packers game was "painful," and practically begged for the real refs to return, which sounded an awful lot like a pro-union statement. Has the controversy been a boon for organized labor?Yes. It obliterates union stereotypes: "The NFL referee lockout is turning into a gigantic advertisement for organized labor," says Jonathan Chait at New York. "Conservatives have spent decades successfully associating labor unions with laziness and shoddy work," and the bungling of the replacement refs, "broadcast into tens of millions of living rooms," is empathic evidence to the contrary. The lockout could potentially be a "seminal event" in how Americans view union employees. "Scott Walker, Packer fan, now a union man"And it bolsters other unions' claims: "Never before has so much media attention been paid to a labor dispute involving so few actual laborers— the 120 NFL referees," says Karl Taro Greenfeld at Bloomberg Businessweek. But the controversy also "reflects a larger trend in the American workplace." In addition to a dispute over pensions, the referees' union is rejecting a strict performance metric that is similar to a recent proposal to evaluate Chicago teachers on student test scores. Both the refs and teachers say such rigid proposals fail to take their work environment into account, and the replacement refs controversy may show that "officiating, like teaching, is as much art as science." "The NFL fiasco: Why referees are like Chicago teachers"This is actually an area of bipartisan agreement: Walker has previously said he "has no beef with private-sector unions," and in this case, he just seems to be advocating a "more conciliatory approach," says David A. Graham at The Atlantic. The most important thing is "to get the unionized refs back on the field," and "on that, at least, Wisconsites should be able to find bipartisan agreement."

417	niger-reduce-fuel-prices-china-loan-rate-cut-153752961--finance	NIAMEY (Reuters) - Niger will reduce the cost of fuel at the pumps by about 7 percent next year as a result of China cutting the interest rate on a loan taken out to pay for the West African country's sole oil refinery, the oil minister said on state television.The move will curb the threat of further social unrest in the West African state, where riots over fuel prices have cost at least two lives this year. There have also been several strikes by taxi drivers over the cost of locally produced fuel.However, the price cut at the pumps will cost the government 14.5 billion CFA francs in lost revenue, Niger's trade minister said.Niger started pumping oil late last year in a joint project with China, which provided a $980 million loan to help to fund the SORAZ refinery in Zinder, 700km east of the capital, Niamey.China's Export-Import Bank agreed in July to cut the rate on the loan to 2 percent, paid back over 20 years, from a rate of Libor plus 3.1 percent over ten years.Foumakoye Gado, Niger's oil minister, said late on Thursday that the rate cut will reduce production costs at SORAZ and "lead, in January 2013, to a 40 CFA franc reduction in the cost of fuel at the pump". The retail price is currently 579 CFA francs per litre.Tax on oil-related products will be cut to 12 percent from 15 percent as part of the move, but Trade Minister Saley Saidou said: "The decision will cost the state 6.5 billion CFA in tax receipts and it will cost the refinery 8 billion CFA."The refinery, which can produce 20,000 barrels of oil a day, is 60 percent owned by China's CNPC, with Niger owning the other 40 percent.	2	3	3	2	2	3	2	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	4
418	nigeria-150-arrested-sweep-against-sect-171527938	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria's military says it arrested more than 150 people and killed 36 others in a campaign across the nation's northeast to disrupt a radical Islamist sect.The military swept through towns in Adamawa and Yobe states over the past few days and ordered civilians to stay indoors. The soldiers focused on apprehending members of Boko Haram, the Islamist extremist sect responsible for a series of bombings and gun attacks in the region. The military said Monday two soldiers were wounded in the operations.It is unclear how effective the operation will prove against the sect, which carries out guerrilla tactics. Nigerian security agencies routinely make mass arrests, but often do not catch the extremists.An Associated Press count shows Boko Haram is responsible for more than 690 killings this year.	3	3	2	4	3	3	3	3	3	1	3	1	1	4	3	4
419	nigeria-naira-firms-cbank-rate-decision-134702607--finance	LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira firmed slightly against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, a day after the central bank left interest rates on hold and said it would keep monetary conditions tight, dealers said.The central bank kept rates on hold for the sixth time in a row at 12 percent on Tuesday, welcoming improved growth and a slight fall in headline inflation. But it said monetary measures will remain hawkish for the foreseeable future.Financial markets in Africa's second biggest economy were closed when the rate decision was made on Tuesday.The naira opened for trade at 157.50 to the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, higher than Tuesday's close of 157.75.Dealers said the naira was partly driven by inflows from foreign investors buying bonds at an auction on Wednesday and oil companies selling the greenback to lenders."Chevron sold around $113 million to some lenders ... NLNG sold an undisclosed amount and (there were) inflows from investors buying bonds," one dealer told Reuters.Nigeria plans to sell 60 billion naira in bonds on Wednesday with maturities of five and seven years.The central bank said $1.4 billion of foreign investment flowed into debt in August.Olayemi Agbe-Davies, a bond dealer at Standard Chartered Bank, told Reuters debt markets had anticipated the hold decision on rates and already factored it into bond pricing, so yields were largely steady on Wednesday.	3	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	2	4	2	1	2	1	3	
420	nigerian-central-bank-bars-loans-big-debtors-post-152721263--finance	LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank has banned loans to 113 firms, including the country's two major airlines, which have failed to repay debts after a 2009 financial crisis that nearly brought down the banking system, an internal document obtained by Reuters on Sunday said.The ban covers firms whose bad debts were absorbed by state-backed "bad bank" AMCON as part of efforts to draw a line under a credit crisis that nearly sank nine lenders. The companies have yet to make good on those loans, the memo said.Nigeria's central bank injected $4 billion in 2009 to support nine lenders it judged to be so weakly capitalized they posed a threat to the whole economy. Since then, a number of banks have been restructured, and AMCON, the Asset Management Company of Nigeria, absorbed their toxic assets."As part of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)'s efforts at strengthening financial stability, it has become necessary to stop debtors who failed to repay their loans to banks and had those loans transferred to AMCON from further enjoying credit facilities ... until they fully repay," the memo said."Banks are prohibited from approving or disbursing any new credit facilities to all persons and organizations on this list," it said, adding that any breach would be punished by a fine equal to the value loan and possibly additional penalties.Names on the list included: Zenon Petroleum, privately owned by billionaire oil tycoon Femi Otedola, the majority shareholder in listed petrol firm Forte Oil ; and MRS Holdings , which holds former Chevron downstream assets and is owned by Sayyu Dantata, brother of Africa's richest man Aliko Dangote.They owe 192.4 billion naira ($1.22 billion) and 120 billion naira respectively, the document said. The list also included Nigeria's biggest national air carrier, Arik Air, with 85 billion in debts.Neither Otedola nor Dantata were available for comment. A spokesman for Arik Air, Ola Adebanji, said the company had not been informed."There is a relationship between Arik and AMCON ... We have not received any document from CBN concerning that," he said.Arik suspended its operations last week over a spat with unions, the airport authorities and the aviation ministry, partly over alleged unpaid dues, leaving thousands of passengers stranded.

421	nigerias-boko-haram-says-no-peace-talks-spokesman-053318248	KANO, Nigeria (Reuters) - The purported leader of Boko Haram, the Islamist sect in Nigeria, has denied government statements the group is involved in peace talks and has said its spokesman Abu Qaqa has been captured by security forces.Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has said the authorities were in dialogue with Boko Haram via back channels and that this was helping neutralise the threat the sect posed.But Abubakar Shekau, the group's leader, said in a video posted on YouTube on Sunday that no such talks were going on."Let it be clear that we never sought dialogue or to sit down with government agents or representatives ... they (Nigerian leaders) will never know peace while they attack our members."The sect is widely considered to be the biggest security threat in Africa's biggest oil exporter. It has been blamed for more than 1,000 deaths since its insurgency - which is aimed at carving out an Islamic state in northern Nigeria - intensified in 2010.Shekau also said the sect's spokesman was being detained by the security forces."Our spokesman, Abu Qaqa is alive but with the security agents, but I believe strongly that after this message from me they may decide to kill him this night," Shekau said.It was the first public statement on the matter by the militants since a raid, which it says led to Qaqa's arrest but not his death.Senior security sources said on September 16 that troops had killed a man identified as "Anwal Kontagora, alias 'Abu Qaqa'", whose pen name is often used to claim responsibility for the sect's pronouncements from its base in the northeast of the country.Shekau said security forces had also begun to arrest militants' wives. The release of sect members held by the security forces has been one of Boko Haram's main demands.There were two bomb blasts on Monday in Maiduguri, the home town of Boko Haram in the remote northeast. One witness said seven soldiers had been killed in one blast but the military said only two of its officers had been wounded.The military has often been accused of playing down the casualties Boko Haram inflicts, while exaggerating the number of sect members it kills and captures.A recent military crackdown appears to have weakened the sect and there has not been a repeat of large-scale coordinated attacks seen earlier this year.	3	3	3	4	3	3	2	3	3	1	3	2	1	3	3	4

423	no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878	LONDON (AP) — It was a meeting of the two most famous British people on the planet: Queen Elizabeth II turned to her tuxedo-wearing guest and said, "Good evening, Mr. Bond."The pairing of these icons, the English monarch and the king of spies — in a film for the opening ceremony of the London Olympics — was a thrilling moment. It scarcely mattered that one of them was fictional. Agent 007 is real to millions of moviegoers, and once again they will flock to see Bond battle for queen and country when his 23rd official screen adventure, "Skyfall," opens this fall.He's come a long way in the 50 years since the release — on Oct. 5, 1962 — of a modestly budgeted spy movie called "Dr. No." It introduced a dapper but deadly secret agent who wore Savile Row suits, drove an Aston Martin, liked his martinis shaken, not stirred, and announced himself as "Bond, James Bond."What's the secret of his survival? Familiarity, says Roger Moore, who played Bond in seven films, more than any other actor."It's sort of like a bedtime story: As long as you don't go too far away from the original, the child is happy," Moore said. "The audience gets what it's expecting: beautiful girls, actions, gadgets — there's a formula."That fiendishly successful formula had modest beginnings. Two upstart producers, Canadian Harry Saltzman and American Albert "Cubby" Broccoli, acquired the rights to a series of novels by Ian Fleming, a former World War II intelligence officer who had created 007 as sort of a fantasy alter-ego.Saltzman and Broccoli had a budget of just $1 million, but through a blend of luck and design assembled an amazing team of on- and off-screen talent.Sean Connery, a relatively unknown Scottish actor and former bodybuilder, was cast as Bond against the wishes of studio United Artists, which wanted an established star such as Cary Grant for the role."Everything or Nothing," a new documentary about the Bond films, says the final seal of approval came from Cubby Broccoli's wife. "Is he sexy?" Broccoli asked her.Connery got the part.Behind the scenes were artists like John Barry, composer of Bond's pulse-quickening theme music; Maurice Binder, who created the famous gun-barrel title sequence; and designer Ken Adam, a German-born former RAF fighter pilot whose futuristic sets gave the films their look of modernist cool.In the documentary, which airs Friday on EPIX, Adam recalls feeling "crazy with courage" in those early days. Others remember the same devil-may-care atmosphere."It was barnstorming days," said David M. Kay, whose company provided aircraft for filming and stunts on the early Bond films, including the helicopter-volcano sequence in "You Only Live Twice.""We didn't have health and safety as we have now. Broccoli was an absolute cavalier and demanded things that were well-nigh impossible," Kay recalled.It was also enormous fun, he said — "Men playing with boys' toys."That sense of playfulness spilled over to the screen. "Dr. No" arrived in movie theaters with perfect timing, as Britain swapped postwar austerity for growing prosperity.Bond's world of cars, casinos and caviar was sexy, luxurious and colorful. Instead of a gray, shadowy figure, here was spy as glamorous jet-setter. The films turned Cold War anxiety into a thrill-ride from which the good guy always emerged triumphant."There had been nothing like it before," said Graham Rye, editor of 007 magazine, who remembers being blown away by the film as an 11-year-old. "A lot of British films at the time were austere, black-and-white, kitchen-sink dramas. When 'Dr. No' exploded onto the screen, it had a pretty visceral effect on everybody."Since then, Bond has survived showdowns with enemies from uber-villain Ernst Blofeld to steel-toothed assassin Jaws. Even more impressively, he has weathered the social revolution of the 1960s, financial woes and lawsuits, multiple changes of lead actor, the end of the Cold War and the dawn of the War on Terror.His survival is the result of chemistry, tenacity and luck."Dr. No" received mixed reviews — some positive, others dismissive. "Pure, escapist bunk," sniffed Bosley Crowther of the New York Times. But audiences responded, and "From Russia With Love," released the next year, was also a hit. By 1964's "Goldfinger," Bond was a phenomenon.From the start, success was enhanced by clever marketing. We may think of product placement and merchandising as recent strategies — Daniel Craig's Bond diverges from his martini habit to drink Heineken — but it was part of the package starting with the books, in which Bond's watch is a Rolex, his shampoo Pinaud Elixir.What began as Fleming's way of demonstrating his character's expensive tastes quickly became a commercial arrangement, now worth millions to the films' producers.In the '60s, Bond fans could wear 007 deodorant and aftershave or sport James Bond swimming trunks, complete with logo. Connery's Bond drank Smirnoff vodka, while the villain in "Goldfinger" played golf with Slazenger balls.More than movies, these were experiences in which key elements were established, expected and anticipated. The locations that spanned the globe and headed into outer space; the gravity-defying stunt sequences; the rocket belts, car-submarines and other gadgets; the megalomaniacal villains and their sadistic henchmen — all quickly became part of the Bond brand.So did the theme songs, many of them performed by the biggest artists of the day, from Paul McCartney ("Live and Let Die") to Madonna ("Die Another Day").And, of course, there were the "Bond girls," characters who are victims or villains but always fatefully — and often fatally — attracted to 007.Bond's scantily clad female companions have long provided ammunition for critics, who accuse the films of sexism, though others argue that the films offer eye-candy for everyone: Ursula Andress in a bikini, but also Daniel Craig in his tight blue swim trunks.Anticipating new tweaks on the familiar elements became part of the films' appeal, rendering them both instantly recognizable and eminently spoofable, as Mike Myers' pitch-perfect Austin Powers movies proved.The films' producers at EON Productions — today run by Cubby Broccoli's daughter and stepson, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson — have become expert at honing the formula. They are masters of suspense, drip-feeding details about each new film — title, locations, guest stars — to eager fans.Like its hero, the series has had many near-death experiences. Connery quit acrimoniously after six films. There was a long-running legal battle with screenwriter Kevin McClory over rights to the "Thunderball" script. The result was the unofficial Bond film "Never Say Never Again," which saw 52-year-old Connery return after a decade away from the role.Former model George Lazenby lasted just a single film — "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" from 1969, a dark-hued tale that ranks among many fans' favorites. Moore took Bond in a lighter direction during the 1970s.Audiences didn't warm to Timothy Dalton's tougher, meaner 1980s Bond, but Pierce Brosnan's suave superagent — circling the globe in ever more futuristic vehicles, including an invisible car— fit with the optimistic post-Cold War era.Just as 007's clothes have evolved with changing fashions — from Connery's lean '60s suits to Moore's flares to Craig's Tom Ford formalwear — producers have tried to find Bonds to mirror the mood of the times.The aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks brought a change of tone. Craig's Bond, who made his debut in "Casino Royale" in 2006, is a darker, tougher spy who harkens back to Fleming's original, restoring sadism and self-loathing to Bond's emotional arsenal.Although the Broccoli family won't comment, media reports say Craig has committed to two more films after "Skyfall," with Bond 24 due for release in 2014 or 2015 — that is, if 007 continues to cheat death.The most recent threat to Bond was a production delay on "Skyfall" when studio MGM filed for bankruptcy in 2010.But Agent 007 is in pretty good shape for 50. Will he last another half century?Rye, the magazine editor, thinks so."Bond, like diamonds, is forever," he said.____AP Fashion Writer Samantha Critchell contributed to this report from New York.____Jill Lawless can be reached at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless	4	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	3	4	2	4	4
424	no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - It might be hard to believe there are more pressure-packed moments in golf than standing over a four-foot putt to win a tournament and pocket a $1 million cheque.But almost to a man, members of the United States and European Ryder Cup teams who will battle at Medinah Country Club this week insist that barely gets the pulse racing compared to the heart-thumping pressure when playing for national pride.All 12 members of each side have won tournaments around the world, some have slipped into green jackets after winning the Masters while others hoisted the Claret Jug after British Open triumphs, but nothing compares to the thrill and heartbreak that accompanies every Ryder Cup.Two years ago at Celtic Manor Graeme McDowell rolled in a 12-footer on the 16th green that secured Europe's margin of victory, the Northern Irishman mobbed by team mates and a euphoric crowd one hole later as his opponent, American Hunter Mahan, was left crushed.In the aftermath of Europe's victory, McDowell described his U.S. Open win earlier that year to a back nine stroll with his dad compared to the weighty burden he felt that day."I can safely say that I don't think I can ever be more nervous on a golf course than I was that day for those last seven holes," McDowell recalled on Tuesday, the first day of official practice for this week's Ryder Cup."You're just trying not to mess up. You're trying not to lose it for your team mates. ... Coming down the stretch that day was some of the toughest golf I had ever played in my life."The Ryder Cup's team concept is a foreign but strangely alluring concept to most golfers who otherwise spend their careers focused on their own performance and bank accounts.But this week 24 of the world's best players will not pocket a penny for the opportunity to put themselves through an emotional meat grinder.At a tournament, if a golfer fails to make the cut, he has only to answer to himself. At the Ryder Cup players must deal with the unfamiliar responsibility of holding up their end and carrying the flag for their respective nations."For us to represent the United States of America and our team mates, it's something else," said Tiger Woods, who is taking part in his seventh Ryder Cup."When it gets to a certain point, either Friday afternoon, late in the evening, or Saturday late in the evening, and all the teams are gathered and there's like one group out there, and if you happen to be in that group, it's interesting."It's so much heat on you."It's different than playing by yourself. Playing for team mates, it just adds an element that it means so much more because it is our country and it is our team mates."GUT-CHURNING INTENSITYThe Ryder Cup generates the type of gut-churning intensity that can cause even golfers with the strongest knees to buckle. Each Ryder Cup produces moments of truth that will test a player's nerve and in some cases define careers.At Kiawah Island in 1991, known in Ryder Cup lore as "The War at the Shore," Mark Calcavecchia suffered one of the biennial event's great collapses.Four-up with four holes to play against Colin Montgomerie, Calcavecchia stumbled and allowed the Scotsman to escape with a half-point.A disconsolate Calcavecchia walked off the 18th green to the beach where he shed a few tears but the U.S. was able to end the day in celebration when Germany's Bernhard Langer, one of golf's coolest customers, missed a short putt on his final hole to hand the Americans a 14 1/2-13 1/2 victory.Experience will help defuse some of the anxiety but there is no escaping the pressure that has come to characterise the Ryder Cup."Experience is a big key this week, just knowing what to expect I suppose," said McDowell. "Just leave nerves on the first tee."It's such an amazing golf event and there's no doubt, the emotions that go with kind of the 12th match on a Sunday afternoon."It was fun to be able to do it; and the aftermath and the 17th green when everyone swamped that green, it was something like I've never seen in golf before, and cool to be a part of."(Editing by Frank Pingue)	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	2	3	3	2	2	3	4
425	norwegian-mass-killers-speech-hit-german-theatre-152333462	BERLIN (Reuters) - A Turkish-German actress will read out Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik's bizarre courtroom speech in German theatres next month in an effort to highlight the widespread prevalence of far-right ideology in Europe.Swiss director Milo Rau adapted the script of "Breivik's Explanation" for the German stage from an audio recording of the hour-long speech the far-right nationalist gave in April before being sentenced by an Oslo court to 21 years in prison for killing 77 people last year.Though Breivik's talk of an international underground of killers - latter-day Crusaders he called the Knights Templar - seemed to be mere fantasy, many of his beliefs are to be found within the fold of anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant populists."His ideological `manifesto' is a distilled representation of a cultural crisis that pervades the European continent and finds expression in an increasingly xenophobic populism," Kirsten Simonsen, a professor at Denmark's Roskilde University, wrote in "Bloodlands", a 2012 series of essays about Breivik.Some notions touched on by Breivik in his justification for setting off a bomb in Oslo and shooting dozens of teenagers dead on an island retreat - that Europe and its indigenous cultures are being weakened by immigration and multiculturalism - have been helping reshape right-wing continental politics for years.The theatre performances in Weimar and Berlin are intended to promote the view that while Breivik's actions were those of a madman, the ideology that drove him is shockingly widespread in democratic societies like Switzerland and Germany, the 35-year-old director told Reuters."It's merely a coincidence that Breivik was the one saying it," Rau said. "His words could just as well have come from 60 percent of the Swiss population."Citing the language of far-right Swiss nationalists who enjoy wide support in his country, Rau added that issues such as a referendum banning the construction of minarets in Switzerland exposed the parallels between Breivik's hate speech and the xenophobia in European society.Breivik's words will merely be read rather than dramatised and there will be no courtroom scene, Rau said. Turkish-German actress Sascha Soydan was chosen to distance the Breivik "character" and his actions from the ideology that drove him."It's not a good speech and it doesn't make for good theatre either," Rau said. "I want to show a text and an ideology, I don't want to depict the person behind them - that's why I opted for this extremely unauthentic portrayal and very dry way of doing it."Only snippets of Breivik's speech were ever made public during the proceedings in April because judges thought publishing it in its entirety would only provide Breivik with a platform for his xenophobic views."There's a reason the speech wasn't allowed to leave the courtroom - so that no one tinkers around with it and makes it seem better than it was," Rau said.Performances are scheduled to take place in Weimar on October 19 and in Berlin on October 27. A panel discussion will follow both performances.(Reporting By Chris Cottrell)	4	3	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	2	4	2	2	3	4	3

427	nrf-holiday-sales-rise-4-1-percent-2012-040237643--finance	NEW YORK (AP) — Americans are expected to spend more during what's traditionally the busiest shopping season of the year, but they're not exactly ready to shop 'til they drop like they have been in the past two years.The National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade group, said Tuesday that it expects sales during the winter holiday shopping period in November and December to rise 4.1 percent this year. That's more than a percentage point lower than the growth in each of the past two years, and the smallest increase since 2009 when sales were up just 0.3 percent.The projections are an important indicator for retailers that depend on the last two months of the year for up to 40 percent of their annual sales. But the estimates also offer valuable insight for economists who closely watch consumer spending, which accounts for up to 70 percent of economic activity.The holiday shopping season is one gauge of not only the shopping habits, but also the mindset of the average American during what has turned out to be a slow and uneven economic recovery. Right now, people are feeling better about rising home prices and a rebounding stock market, but job growth is still weak and prices for everything from food to gas are higher. At the same time, there's uncertainty about who the next president will be and some Americans worry that the U.S. debt crisis could lead to another recession."In all the years, this is the most challenging year doing a forecast," said Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the National Retail Federation, based in Washington, D.C. "There are so many uncertainties."No one's feeling those uncertainties more than U.S. shoppers. Darlene Johnson of Silver Spring, Md., says her outlook has improved in the last few months. The value of her 401(k) retirement plan has risen. Home sales where she lives are up again, and her neighbors are getting higher prices for their houses.Still, Johnson, who's been grappling with higher food and gas prices, says the economy is still not stable enough for her to splurge during this holiday shopping season. And she's worried about how the debt crisis could affect her.Johnson says last year, she overindulged and spent about $5,000. It took until this past May to pay down her credit card debt. As a result, this year, she plans to cut her holiday spending to $1,500."I felt too much pressure financially," said Johnson, who works for the National Institutes of Health, a government agency that's a conglomerate of research centers. "I am not going to do it to myself again."It's Americans' worries about the economic uncertainty that led the National Retail Federation to predict slower growth during the winter holiday shopping season than the increase of 5.6 percent and 5.5 percent in 2010 and 2011, respectively.Still, the forecast is higher than the average growth of 3.5 percent for November and December over the past 10 years. And it continues a growth trend that began after holiday sales fell 4.4 percent in 2008 during the middle of the recession. (The federation for the first time is counting online sales and sales from the auto parts and accessories business. It has revised every year's forecast from 2000 to reflect the change.)The federation's forecast also is still more optimistic than the International Council of Shopping Centers, a mall trade group that last week said it predicts a 2.9 percent increase. It's also higher than the 3.3 percent growth estimated by ShopperTrak, a Chicago-based analyzer of retail foot traffic, last month.The forecasts come as retailers wrap up what's expected to be a strong back-to-school shopping season. There have been no official numbers out on sales for that shopping period, which is typically the second biggest shopping season of the year and a barometer for what people are willing to spend during the winter holidays. But Ken Perkins, president of RetailMetrics LLC, said he expects revenue at stores opened at least a year to be up 5 percent for the combined August and September months.But predicting holiday spending is never easy. Take last year's holiday period. Overall sales were strong, but sales don't tell the whole story: Retailers' profits were eroded because they had to do a lot of discounting to get shoppers to spend, particularly during the final weeks before Christmas.And all the economic variables that will likely have an impact on this year's shopping season make predicting sales that much more difficult. Among them, the worry that the U.S. economy will fall off into another recession next year. That's when tax increases and deep spending cuts will take effect unless Congress reaches a budget deal.Retailers and economists are hoping history doesn't repeat itself. The last time there was such a budget battle, in August 2011, it ended with the country losing its top credit rating, nervous investors fleeing the stock market, and shoppers taking a break from buying.Still, Americans are more optimistic than they have been in a long time. Consumers' confidence rose to a seven-month high in September even as the unemployment rate has been stuck at around 8 percent, according to the Conference Board. Gallup Poll, which tracks consumer confidence daily, also registered a pickup in confidence last month to the highest level since May. The upcoming presidential election seems to be having an impact on how shoppers' view the economy, economists say.Adding to that, Americans have seen their stock portfolios grow as The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index has surged more than 15 percent this year. And national home prices were up in July 1.2 percent compared to the same month last year, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller index released last week. That's the second straight year-over-year gain after two years without one.Still, some economists question whether the higher level of confidence among Americans is sustainable. Confidence has been bouncing around since the recession and the current level is still well below what's considered healthy. Moreover, the spike in confidence has yet to translate into a surge in spending."You have to be confident to spend, but because you're confident doesn't necessarily mean you'll spend," said Dennis Jacobe, chief economist at Gallup Poll.For their part, retailers already are being cautious. John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, says retailers are expected to increase holiday hiring by 6 percent to about 700,000 for the October through December period compared with a year ago, when that figure was 660,200. That's well above the 324,900 hired during the financial meltdown in 2008, but still below the 746,800 level in pre-recession 2006, and well under the nearly 850,000 seasonal workers hired during the height of the dot.com boom in 1999. NRF predicts merchants will hire between 585,000 and 625,000 seasonal workers for the holidays. That's in line with last year's 607,000, according to the trade group's measure.And they're already starting to offer enticements to lure holiday shoppers. Kmart, a division of Sears Holdings Corp., Toys R Us and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. have announced last month they're either lowering or waiving the upfront services fees for their interest-free pay-over-time program. All three said the moves were in response to complaints from shoppers.	3	3	3	4	5	4	3	4	3	4	3	2	2	2	3	3
428	ny-state-senator-loses-election-backing-gay-marriage-233834273	NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Republican state senator whose vote was crucial to legalizing gay marriage in New York has lost his primary election while a Senate colleague who also broke with the party's stance against same-sex unions narrowly escaped defeat.Senators Roy McDonald and Stephen Saland were among four New York Senate Republicans to cast key votes last year to make New York the most populous U.S. state to allow homosexual marriages. After a count of absentee ballots, McDonald was determined to have lost his race while Saland narrowly won in September 13 primary elections.Mark Grisanti, another Republican senator who backed the gay marriage measure, which passed New York's Republican-controlled Senate on a 33-29 vote in June 2011, won his primary race by a clear margin. A fourth senator who supported the bill was not seeking re-election.McDonald lost the Republican nomination in the 43rd District to Kathy Marchione, the Saratoga County clerk, in a contest that frequently touched on the issue of gay marriage.Although the results are yet to be certified, Marchione had a lead of about 110 votes after a final count of absentee ballots, according to her campaign and The Saratogian newspaper. About 50 votes still were awaiting adjudication by a judge."Senator McDonald's vote on marriage was certainly on the minds of voters but they took even greater issue with the fact that he was telling people he would vote a certain way up to a week prior and then voted differently," said Ken Girardin, a spokesman for the Marchione campaign.A McDonald spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.Saland of Poughkeepsie and Grisanti of Buffalo have retained their party's support following the primaries.Saland's victory was not secured until Monday after a final tally of absentee ballots gave him a lead of a little more than 100 votes.The New York primary races were being closely watched as a measure of the tolerance Republican voters might have for candidates who deviate from the official party line, which defines marriage as being between "one man and one woman."Lawmakers in Rhode Island, Delaware and elsewhere are expected to weigh gay marriage legislation next year and some Republican backing could be needed to pass those measures.And this November, voters in four states - Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington - will decide ballot initiatives on the issue. Same-sex marriage has been legalized in seven states and the District of Columbia.But the outcomes of the New York primaries were close enough that both opponents and supporters of same-sex marriage were able to find encouragement in the results on Tuesday.Jason McGuire, the executive director of New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms, an evangelical Christian organization that lobbies against same-sex marriage, said Marchione's victory and even Saland's narrow win should be seen as a warning to Republican legislators tempted to "go rogue," as he put it."The fact that she came from behind with so little support shows that no amount of activist dollars can protect you from an angry electorate," he said of Marchione's victory.But Lynn Faria, the interim executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda, which has lobbied in support of same-sex marriage, said Marchione's narrow win showed many Republicans are willing to back candidates who support gay unions."Now that we finally know the unofficial results of our state's primary elections, even some among the most conservative of New York voters have sent a clear message that they will support elected officials who stood on the right side of history in June 2011," she said in a statement.

Madoff claimed when he pleaded guilty to fraud charges three years ago that he acted alone.Prosecutors say it will take about two months to present all the evidence against those accused of helping him cheat thousands of people out of nearly $20 billion.Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence in North Carolina.	3	2	2	3	2	2	2	2	3	2	3	2	1	3	2	4
431	nyc-worlds-largest-ferris-wheel-171830672	NEW YORK (AP) — The Big Apple is getting another "biggest": The world's biggest Ferris wheel is to be built on Staten Island, in an ambitious attempt to draw tourists to what's sometimes known as the city's "forgotten borough," officials announced ThursdayThe $230 million attraction, to be called the New York Wheel, is to grace a spot overlooking the Statue of Liberty, New York Harbor and the downtown Manhattan skyline — a singular view that officials hope will add to the appeal what they say would be the world's tallest Ferris wheel. The 625-foot-tall structure would swing higher than the Singapore Flyer, the London Eye, and a "High Roller" wheel planned in Las Vegas."The New York Wheel will be an attraction unlike any other in New York City — even unlike any other on the planet," Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a release.Construction is expected to begin in early 2014 on the privately financed project, which also includes a 100-shop outlet mall and a 200-room hotel. The grand opening could come by the end of 2015.While riding the Staten Island Ferry is a staple of many visitors' agendas, the city has long sought to entice tourists off the boat and into Staten Island, the least populous and most remote borough — one once known for hosting the world's largest landfill.Australian tourists Leah Field and Adam Lica, for example, were riding the ferry Thursday for its views of the Statue of Liberty. They thought they might have lunch on the Staten Island side but weren't planning to explore further."We weren't sure what there is to do there," explained Lica, 32, of Melbourne.Were there a giant Ferris wheel, would the couple stay to ride it? Probably, he said.Staten Island has its attractions, including a minor league ballpark and the zoo that hosts Staten Island Chuck, New York's answer to the famous prognosticating groundhog of Punxsutawney, Pa. Chuck bears the dubious distinction of having once bitten Bloomberg.But Staten Island, the only one of the city's five boroughs not accessible by subway, tends to get overshadowed by its municipal neighbors, so much so that some have at times suggested it secede from the city.To Staten Island resident Miatta Bryant, the wheel might bring the borough more respect."I think it'll be a really good idea," the 26-year-old certified nursing assistant said. "People always say Staten Island is so boring."The project is expected to bring $500 million in private investment to the borough's St. George waterfront, and the developers will pay the city $2.5 million a year in rent for the land.	3	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	3	2	4	2	3	2	3	4
432	nypd-watching-facebook-fight-gang-bloodshed-202724034	NEW YORK (AP) — Police investigating two gangs called the Very Cripsy Gangsters and the Rockstarz didn't need to spend all their time pounding the pavement for leads. Instead, they fired up their computers and followed the trash talk on Facebook."Rockstarz up 3-0," one suspect boasted — a reference to the body count from a bloody turf war between the Brooklyn gangs that ultimately resulted in 49 arrests last month.Authorities in New York say a new generation of gang members is increasingly using social media to boast of their exploits and issue taunts and challenges that result in violence. And police and prosecutors have responded over the past several years by closely monitoring Facebook and other sites for leads and evidence.On Tuesday, New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced plans to beef up the NYPD's cyber crackdown by expanding the use of aggressive online investigative tactics and doubling the size of the department's gang unit to 300 investigators.The reinforcements will focus less on established gangs like the Bloods and Crips and more on loosely knit groups of teenagers who stake out a certain block or section of a housing project as their turf and exact vengeance on those who trespass or fail to show the proper respect."By capitalizing on the irresistible urge of these suspects to brag about their murderous exploits on Facebook, detectives used social media to draw a virtual map of their criminal activity over the last three years," the commissioner said in remarks prepared for delivery at a law enforcement convention in San Diego.Examples of the public displays of digital bravado abound. In the Brooklyn case, suspects sought to intimidate informants by posting court documents containing their names, authorities said. In another throwdown, the Rockstarz posted a photo of a Very Crispy member and the comment, "He is scared. Look at him."Police say much of the potentially incriminating material they gather can be found on Facebook profiles that are public.But as part its new, stepped-up efforts, the department will refine and expand use of a tactic instrumental in the three-year Brooklyn gang investigation — having officers adopt Internet aliases, create phony profiles and seek to "friend" suspects to gain access to nonpublic information, officials said.It's an effort that should be closely regulated, said Christopher Dunn, associate legal director for the New York Civil Liberties Union."Electronic undercover work is fine," Dunn said. "But we worry about the ease with which the police can use deceit on the Internet to monitor private communications."Police and prosecutors insist they are following strict legal protocols."When we meet with the police and we talk about investigative techniques, when they are on these social media sites, we'll give them certain directions," Ed Carroll, head of the Gang Bureau of the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, said Tuesday. "We don't want to set up any situation where anyone is being entrapped or put in a position where they're going to agree to commit a crime."In Chicago, police similarly monitor Facebook and other social media to learn what gang members are saying about shootings and other crimes. They also built a database of the city's gang members and provide commanders with software that allows them to send officers to spots where they expect a gang to retaliate for a shooting.A federal judge in New York has already weighed in on the privacy issue, siding with prosecutors in a gang case in the Bronx.In that case, federal investigators infiltrated the private Facebook posts of a suspected leader of a drug crew leader by using the account of a "friend" who became an informant. Court papers says the posts included comments about cocaine deals such as, "I'm trying to see the man for like 600 grams," and photos of the suspect making gang hand gestures.Defense attorneys tried to have the material thrown out, arguing it was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure.In a decision last month, U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley wrote that defendant Melvin Colon's "legitimate expectation of privacy ended when he disseminated posts to his 'friends' because those 'friends' were free to use the information however they wanted — including sharing it with the government."___Associated Press writers Verena Dobnik in New York and Don Babwin in Chicago contributed to this report.	4	5	5	4	4	4	3	4	4	2	4	2	2	4	4	
433	obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics	Two new independent studies of health insurance premiums and health care spending indicate both are rising at an accelerated pace, despite President Obama's 2008 promise to contain those costs and his pledge that his health care legislation would reduce premiums.Spending on health care surged 4.6 percent in 2011 - up $4,500 per person, on average - according to the nonpartisan Health Care Cost Institute. That's up from a 3.8 growth rate in 2010.Health insurance premiums for individuals and families also climbed year-over-year, up 3 percent ($186) on average for an individual and 4 percent ($672) on average for a family, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.During Obama's term, between 2009 to 2012, premiums have climbed $2,370 for the average family with an employer-provided plan - a rate faster than the during the previous four years under President George W. Bush, according to Kaiser.Experts point to rising health care costs as the driver of increased individual spending and higher premiums.During the 2008 campaign and health care reform debate in 2009, President Obama said repeatedly that his plan would bend the cost curve downward, ultimately saving the average family $2,500 per year.At a rally in Virginia in June 2008, Obama said: "In an Obama administration, we'll lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year.""We'll do it by investing in disease prevention, not just disease management; by investing in a paperless health care system to reduce administrative costs; and by covering every single American and making sure that they can take their health care with them if they lose their job," he said at the time. "We'll also reduce costs for business and their workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses."We won't do all this twenty years from now, or ten years from now," he said. "We'll do it by the end of my first term as President of the United States."And in a debate with Sen. John McCain in October 2008: "The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year," he said.Obama and Democrats enacted the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. "Obamacare," in March 2010, including many of the projected cost-saving measures that were hailed before voters.Many of those cost-savings have yet to be realized.President Obama explained in response to a question from ABC News at a Sept. 2010 press conference that "bending the cost curve on health care is hard to do.""I said at the time, it wasn't going to happen tomorrow, it wasn't going to happen next year. It took us decades to get into a position where our health care costs were going up 6, 7, 10 percent a year. And so our goal is to slowly bring down those costs," he said.Obama added, "as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care, at the margins, that's going to increase our costs, we knew that. We didn't think that we were going to cover 30 million people for free, but that the long-term trend in terms of how much the average family is going to be paying for health insurance is going to be improved as a consequence of health care."Last year, I asked White House deputy chief of staff Nancy-Ann DeParle about that $2,500 in savings the president pledged. She insisted families will see that savings seven years after the president said it would be achieved - by 2019."Many of the changes in the Affordable Care Act are starting this year, and in succeeding years," DeParle told ABC News, "and by 2019 we estimate that the average family will save around $2,000."DeParle said that the "big increases that occurred (in 2010) were probably driven by insurance plans overestimating what the impact would be and maybe trying to take some profits upfront before some of the changes in the Affordable Care Act occur."The White House did not return a call for comment about the big increases in 2011.-Jake Tapper and Devin Dwyer	3	2	4	3	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	2	1	3	3	3

436	obama-using-voter-registration-stay-close-nc-074114793--election	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Dozens of volunteers armed with clipboards and voter registration forms gather at President Barack Obama's field office here every day. Their mission: Fan out across the city seeking new voters in this rapidly growing state."Are you registered to vote at your current address?" asks Douglas Johnston, a volunteer wooing voters outside the county courthouse. "Do you know about early voting?"The effort, it seems, has borne fruit — to the tune of more than 250,000 new registered voters in North Carolina since April 2011, according to Obama's team. That's more new voters than the campaign has registered anywhere else in the country.It's an eye-popping total in a state that Obama won by just 14,000 votes four years ago. And the flood of new voters — presumably a chunk of them Democrats — could help keep North Carolina within the president's reach in a year when everything else here seems to be working in Republican Mitt Romney's favor.North Carolina has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate just twice in 40 years. The state's economy is abysmal; its 9.7 percent unemployment rate is among the nation's highest. And the president's embrace of gay marriage put him at odds with a majority of North Carolina voters, including many blacks, who make up the core of his support here.But less than six weeks from Election Day, Romney is spending millions of dollars in television advertising in North Carolina, defending territory that remains more conservative than most of the states that will decide the election. That raises questions about his chances in places like Ohio, Florida and Virginia, where polls show him trailing the president.Compared with Obama, Romney has fewer paths to victory in the state-by-state contest to cobble together enough wins to reach the requisite 270 Electoral College votes. That makes North Carolina's 15 electoral votes more important to him than to Obama, who could still win the White House without a North Carolina victory.Romney's campaign won't say how many new voters they have registered in the state.And registration numbers alone don't tell the whole story in North Carolina. Democrats have long outnumbered Republicans in the state, even though voters sided with GOP presidential candidates for decades. And Democratic registration has fallen by about 90,000 since the end of 2008, while unaffiliated voters have increased by more than 250,000.A shortage of independent polls in North Carolina makes the state's status 40 days out hard to judge. But both parties say the race is tight."Changing demographics have made this state more competitive than past years," said Robert Reid, Romney's North Carolina communications director. But he expressed confidence that the lagging economy would help the Republican win a close contest."The race is, and has been, within the margin of error," said Ken Eudy, a veteran Democratic strategist in North Carolina.North Carolina's rapid transition from a GOP stalwart to a presidential battleground has largely been due to increased voter registration of new African-American and Hispanic residents, as well as of transplants from the Northeast.They're people like Diana Hrabosky, a Democrat who just moved to the state and registered to vote on Wednesday with an Obama campaign volunteer. And Walter Woody III, who recently turned 18 and is eligible to vote for the first time."It seems like no matter what race you are, people are starting to get more Democratic," said Woody, who is black, after he finished filling out a registration form.This year, Romney's campaign was determined not to get caught off guard in North Carolina like GOP nominee John McCain was four years ago. Republicans have built a more substantial ground operation here, but still trail Obama in manpower. The president has 53 field offices across North Carolina to Romney's 24.About 1.6 million people in North Carolina, or one-fourth of the electorate, are registered to vote but not affiliated with a party.Paul Shumaker, a Republican consultant who has handled statewide races, said those voters may present just as many problems for Romney as the Democrats."Having to go through a Republican primary that pulled him to the right hurts him in building a winning coalition in the state," Shumaker said.Theresa Jeffers is one of the unaffiliated voters siding with Romney — though she says it's more a vote against Obama than in favor of the Republican."I was hoping so much that he would be successful," Jeffers, 64, said of the president. She said she's been disappointed by his performance in office, particularly on the debt.Romney is hoping millions of dollars in television advertisements will convince more voters like Jeffers to side with him. The candidate and his GOP allies have spent more than $32 million on ads in North Carolina, including $2 million last week alone.Obama and Democrats have spent nearly $18 million on North Carolina advertising. But their rate of weekly spending has slowed, down about half from their peak in the summer. Obama's campaign is also not running the costly two-minute ad it released Thursday in the state.Neither candidate has devoted much time on the ground in North Carolina. Romney has made four trips to the state, while Obama has been here three times, including during the Democratic Party's convention in Charlotte earlier this month. But their running mates and wives have been frequent visitors.Obama had planned to deliver his acceptance speech at a Charlotte football stadium with seating for 74,000 and use the gathering for voter registration and recruitment. But the outdoor event was canceled, with Democrats blaming the weather and Republicans accusing the president of not being able to draw a capacity crowd.___Associated Press writer Charles Babington in Washington contributed to this report.___Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC.	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	2	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	4

438	oils-slide-continues-crude-near-92-165844038--finance	Oil prices fell on Wednesday for the third day in a row as traders realized that a recent run-up to $100 may have been overdone.Oil was at $91.99 in early afternoon trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was down $3.30, or 3.5 percent.Several things were pushing prices down. Analysts said traders are taking profits after oil got above $100 per barrel on Friday for the first time since May. And there have more signs this week that the global economy is slowing down, which tends to push oil prices lower because people and businesses use less energy.Also, crude inventories rose three times more than analysts had expected last week. Crude supplies grew by 8.5 million barrels to 367.6 million barrels. That's 8.4 percent higher than at the same time last year, according to the Energy Information Administration's weekly report.Analysts expected a rise of 2.5 million barrels, according to Platts, the energy information arm of McGraw-Hill Cos.Oil has fallen about 7 percent this week. It hadn't dropped below $92 per barrel since Aug. 10.Oil's decline came despite some news that might have pushed prices higher. The Bank of Japan said on Wednesday that it would buy more government bonds, which is intended to boost Japan's economy. And ongoing tensions in the Middle East have tended to drive prices higher."Yet we continue to fall," said Addison Armstrong, senior director for market research at Tradition Energy. "I think that has accelerated some profit-taking. After all, crude did have a pretty good run from $86 up to $100."Brent crude traded on the ICE Futures exchange in London also fell sharply. It was down $3, or 2.7 percent, to $109.03 per barrel.Traders were also keeping their eyes on oil supplies as U.S. Gulf Coast refineries returned to production after shutting down due to Hurricane Isaac."We're getting back a few more refineries post (Hurricane Isaac), but on the flip side a few refineries had some restart issues and a few are headed into maintenance," said Carl Larry of Oil Outlooks and Opinions in a newsletter.Regular gasoline at the pump fell a half a penny to $3.854 per gallon.In other futures trading in New York:— Wholesale gasoline fell 5.9 cents to $2.84 per gallon.— Heating oil slipped 7.7 cents to $3.0501 per gallon.— Natural gas rose 2.9 cents to $2.802 per 1,000 cubic feet.---Associated Press writers Pablo Gorondi in Budapest and Pamela Sampson in Bangkok contributed to this report.	2	4	2	3	4	4	4	2	4	2	4	1	2	1	3	3
439	olympus-former-executives-plead-guilty-scandal-trial-013639963--finance	TOKYO (Reuters) - Three former executives of Japanese camera and endoscope maker Olympus Corp <7733.T> pleaded guilty on Tuesday after being charged in connection with a $1.7 billion accounting cover-up in one of the biggest corporate scandals in Japan.Prosecutors charged ex-chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, former executive vice-president Hisashi Mori and former auditor Hideo Yamada with inflating the company's net worth in financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 2007 and 2008, in violation of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law."The full responsibility lies with me and I feel deeply sorry for letting down our business partners, shareholders and the wider public," Kikukawa told the Tokyo district court at the start of the trial."As the president of the company I take full responsibility for what happened," he added.The three former executives had been identified by an investigative panel, commissioned by Olympus, as the main suspects in the fraud seeking to delay the reckoning from risky investments made in the late-1980s bubble economy.The scandal was exposed last October by chief executive Michael Woodford, who was sacked by the Olympus board after querying dubious deals later found to have been used to conceal the losses. Woodford campaigned to win his job back, but has given up that bid, blaming cozy ties between management and big Japanese shareholders and citing the strain on his family.Since then, Olympus has admitted it used improper accounting to conceal massive investment losses under a scheme that began in the 1990s. The firm is under investigation by law enforcement agencies in Japan, Britain and the United States.In December it filed five years' worth of corrected financial statements plus overdue first-half results, revealing a $1.1 billion dent in its balance sheet, triggering talk it would need to merge or forge a business tie-up to raise capital.(Reporting by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	3	2	3	2	1	3	3	3

442	opposition-seizes-jail-torture-video-georgian-election-094826639	TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili promised on Wednesday to punish those responsible for torturing and raping prisoners, after video of the abuse was shown on television and sparked protests in the capital Tbilisi.The government of the former Soviet republic said guards had been paid to stage the abuse for political motives, less than two weeks before a parliamentary election in the former Soviet republic.The prosecutor's office said 10 people had been arrested including the head of the Tbilisi prison, two deputies and a number of guards. The prisons minister said she was resigning."Tonight, I tell all the victims of these inhuman actions and the whole nation that the Georgia we have built and we are all building together shall not and will not tolerate such behavior - in its prisons or anywhere else," Saakashvili said in a statement issued in the early hours of Wednesday."Those who committed these crimes will spend long years in jail, as will those who bribed guards to stage these horrors and film them," he said, promising that the rights of prisoners would be better protected.Georgia, a key transit route for oil and gas supplies across the volatile Caucasus region, is gearing up for an October 1 election in which Saakashvili and his United National Movement face a challenge from a new opposition coalition, Georgian Dream, led by billionaire entrepreneur Bidzina Ivanishvili.'RAPE ME' POSTERSHundreds of demonstrators rallied overnight in the capital after two pro-opposition television channels, including one owned by Ivanishvili, showed the footage purporting to show torture, rape and other abuses in the Tbilisi prison."This bloody regime should step down," Dachi Tsaguria, one of the organisers of the protest, told Reuters.The protesters, who were urged to join the rally by messages on Facebook, held posters saying "Rape me!"Dozens of people began gathering in the center of the capital to resume the protest on Wednesday.The government said the videos had been staged and recorded by police officers who had been bribed by "politically motivated persons"."An investigation revealed that several members of the jail's security department had been involved in a plan to carry out abusive activities and record them," the Interior Ministry said in a statement."Evidence shows that payments were made to coordinate and stage these appalling activities," it said.Georgian Dream, which unites several opposition parties, has gathered large numbers to its rallies in the Caucasus state, although most opinion polls show it trails the ruling party before the election.Ivanishvili, 56, has a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $6.4 billion. He and other opponents accuse Saakashvili of curbing freedoms and criticise him for leading Georgia into a disastrous war with Russia in August 2008.(Reporting by Margarita Antidze; editing by Mark Trevelyan)	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	4	3	
443	orioles-beat-red-sox-6-3-clinch-playoff-022728996--mlb	BALTIMORE (AP) — The champagne was on ice, plastic shields were in place above the cubicles in the Baltimore clubhouse and couches were removed to accommodate a celebration 15 years in the making.The party never happened — at least not at the ballpark. Baltimore clinched its first playoff berth since 1997, but not until late Sunday when the Texas Rangers beat the Los Angeles Angels 8-7 in the finale of a day-night doubleheader.After the Orioles beat the Boston Red Sox 6-3 earlier Sunday, around two dozen players and coaches took scoreboard watching to a new level by staying on the field at Camden Yards and rooting for the Rangers to win the opener,Orioles players exchanged high-fives and fist-bumps following their fourth straight win, then gathered along the first-base line to watch the scoreboard telecast of the ninth inning, which began with Texas winning 4-3.Many in the crowd of 41,257 stood and watched, too.But a two-run double by Torii Hunter put the Angels in front and ruined the fun. As the Orioles walked off the field, manager Buck Showalter waved to the crowd and offered a fist-pump of encouragement.Sitting in front of his locker with a beer in his hand, first baseman Mark Reynolds said, "It would have definitely been cool to celebrate with our fans. They've been supporting us all year. To be able to celebrate out there with them and take in the moment, it would have been pretty neat."Baltimore, on the other hand, is looking to go into the postseason as AL East champions. The Orioles remain tied atop the division standings with the New York Yankees, who rallied to beat Toronto 9-6 and also clinched no worse than a wild-card berth.Both contenders have three games left. New York begins a season-ending series against visiting Boston on Monday night, and the Orioles travel to Tampa Bay.Baltimore held out hope of cracking open a few cases of champagne in Florida."I take particular enjoyment in ruining someone else's clubhouse," reliever Darren O'Day said.Shortstop J.J. Hardy added, "I'm not going to say there's no disappointment, but we all understand we need to keep playing good baseball to get where we want to be. We'll just worry about ourselves and win the next three games."Who'd have thought the Orioles would be talking about division titles, playoff berths and champagne after 14 consecutive losing seasons and four straight last-place finishes? The Orioles (92-67) already have 23 more wins than a year ago."Our goal now is try to figure out a way to play some more baseball games here at Camden," Showalter said. "Hopefully, it's see you later."Hardy, Nate McLouth and Chris Davis hit solo homers, and Jim Thome drove in two runs for Baltimore. The Orioles completed a sweep and went 13-5 against Boston, their most wins in a single season versus the Red Sox since 1970 (13-5).Joe Saunders (3-3) allowed three runs, eight hits and no walks in 7 1-3 innings for Baltimore. Obtained in a late-August trade with Arizona, Saunders has yielded a total of 12 earned runs in his last six starts.Jim Johnson worked the ninth for his 50th save.Cody Ross and Daniel Nava homered for the last-place Red Sox, who have dropped five straight and 16 of 22. Boston (69-90) last lost 90 games in 1966."We haven't had a good season," manager Bobby Valentine acknowledged.Zach Stewart (0-2) gave up five runs and seven hits, including two homers, in 2 2-3 innings. In three starts this season he's surrendered eight home runs.After being beaten and bashed by the Orioles, who hit seven homers in the three-game series, the Red Sox now head to Yankee Stadium.A sunny, breezy fall afternoon couldn't have started much better for the Orioles. After the video board showed the Yankees and Angels losing early, McLouth hit the fourth pitch from Stewart over the left-field wall."After that just trying to do damage control," Stewart said. "Try to keep it at that score. Obviously I didn't do that."Hardy and Davis followed with singles before Stewart hit Jones with a pitch to load the bases. After Matt Wieters bounced into a run-scoring 4-6-3 double play, Thome followed with grounder up the middle that beat the shift and rolled into the outfield, scoring Davis for a 3-0 lead.Boston wasted doubles in the second and third innings before Hardy led off the bottom of the third with his 22nd home run. Jones singled with one out, and Thome chased Stewart with an RBI single.Ross homered in the fourth to get the Red Sox to 5-1. Davis connected off Clayton Mortensen in the fifth, his 31st homer of the season and fourth in four games.Nava homered in the seventh with a man on.NOTES: Jones was chosen Orioles MVP in a vote among media covering the team, the second straight year he's won the award. "It is given to me, but I think the whole team deserves it," he said. ... Boston hit three doubles and now has a major-league leading 214 for the season. ... Red Sox RHP Clay Buchholz, who's 2-4 with a 5.84 ERA lifetime against the Yankees, starts Monday night against CC Sabathia. Rookie Wei-Yin Chen (12-10) starts for Baltimore in Tampa Bay against Alex Cobb (10-9). ... The top three players in the Baltimore lineup — McLouth, Hardy and Davis — combined to go 6 for 10 with three HRs and five runs.	4	4	3	3	4	2	2	3	3	4	3	1	2	2	3	3

But the OSCE verdict on the election is sure to increase his international isolation and lock in place poor ties with the West."The blatant violations in these elections make it clear to everyone that Belarus is the last dictatorship in the heart of Europe," said Guido Westerwelle, foreign minister of Germany, Europe's biggest economy."Together with our European partners we will increase our efforts to push for the release of political prisoners, to strengthen Belarus civil society and to isolate President Lukashenko and his regime even more."Lukashenko and his inner circle are under travel and other sanctions from the United States and the European Union.CRACKDOWN ON PROTESTRelations with the West nosedived when he cracked down on street protests against his re-election in December 2010.

447	overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916	NEW YORK (AP) — Just after 10 p.m., when most people their age are going to sleep, a group of elderly folks suffering from dementia are just getting started, dancing and shaking tambourines and maracas in a raucous version of "La Bamba.""It's a party," says an 81-year-old woman, among dozens of patients brought to a Bronx nursing home every night for a structured series of singalongs, crafts and therapy sessions that lasts until dawn.The program, which appears to be rare, is kind of a "night camp" for dementia victims who don't sleep at night or tend to wake up agitated or become frightened or disoriented by the fall of darkness.It's meant to provide care and activity — lots of activity — to fill the wee hours for people with Alzheimer's and similar diseases who live at home. And it's meant to provide their caregivers — usually a son or daughter — with a treasured night's sleep."Without this program, my father would be lost, and I would be crazy," said Robert Garcia, whose 82-year-old father, Felix, is in the program at the Hebrew Home at Riverdale called ElderServe at Night. "He doesn't sleep. At night he's wide awake, and he needs activity."Garcia, who lives in a Bronx apartment with his wife and three of their children, said that before his father went into the program he would wake up in the night, loudly, and keep everyone else from sleeping."We would all wake up, and my daughter would ask, 'Why is Grandpa screaming? Why is he so grumpy?'" Garcia said."Now he comes home in the morning, shows me his drawings, tells me what they did all night."While many nursing homes offer temporary "respite care" so caregivers can catch up on sleep or go on vacation, the overnight-only program at the Hebrew Home fills a niche.But costs are high, and such programs are rare. An official at the Alzheimer's Association said she knew of no other.Daniel Reingold, president and CEO of the Hebrew Home, said the nonsectarian overnight program was started in 1998 because anecdotal studies found the biggest reason people gave for admitting loved ones into the nursing home was sleep deprivation of the caregiver."Someone with Alzheimer's can be getting up at 3 a.m., banging the pots and pans, thinking they were making dinner, even walking out of the house," Reingold said. "We heard stories of caregivers who were sleeping on mattresses across the front doorway so their loved one couldn't get out."Most patients' care is covered by Medicaid, which pays the Hebrew Home $140 a night, plus $74 for transportation to and from home.Dr. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, said sleep problems are typical in dementia and include the syndrome known as "sundowning," in which the fall of darkness causes confusion and fear. At the Hebrew Home, shades are kept closed.Abrams says an overnight activity program like the Hebrew Home's is preferable to "fighting nature by insisting that participants try to sleep."Ruth Drew, director of family services at the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, said, "Many family members want to care for relatives with Alzheimer's at home, but in order to do that, the caregivers themselves have to remain healthy. You cannot stay healthy if you don't get a good night's sleep."Many patients sleep a few hours at home during the day.As the night passed at the Hebrew Home, other activities were offered to the 34 patients, who were in their 60s to 90s. Most moved on to a "cooking" program, where they were asked to peel and slice a banana, then add grapes and blueberries for a fruit salad.During the slow process, the patients were asked, in English and Spanish, about colors and shapes. Several downed the fruit as it came their way, before salads could be compiled.Other nighttime activities include walks through the nearly empty halls of the nursing home and "movie nights" with popcorn. Patients who are up to it are sometimes taken on field trips; for example, to see the neighborhood's Christmas lights.In quiet rooms, patients with more profound dementia were guided in simple puzzles like putting a peg in a hole. Others had sand or water poured over their hands to stimulate tactile sensations and perhaps reminiscences."They haven't been to the beach in years," said program director Deborah Messina. "Maybe it's a fond memory."One darkened room was filled with recorded sounds of nature, a pleasant aroma and twinkly lights, all meant to provide gentle stimulation.On occasion, a patient would nod off. There are "resting rooms" for patients who want to sleep, but half-hour naps in their chairs are more common."It's like a sleepover," Messina said. "It's a little bit of a party, and like a sleepover, when they come home in the morning, they haven't slept much."	4	4	4	2	4	3	2	4	4	2	3	2	2	1	4	4
448	pablo-escobar-t-shirts-hit-mexico-drug-war-195722537	MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Nearly two decades after Colombian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar died in a hail of bullets, his eldest son is conquering new markets in Mexico - with a fashion line in his father's image.Sebastian Marroquin's designer T-shirts, plastered with photos of Escobar, are hot sellers in Mexican states that are on the front lines of the country's deadly drug war.The shirts are emblazoned with images of the Medellin cartel boss, who flooded the world with cocaine before he was shot dead in 1993. Featuring pictures from Escobar's student ID card, driver's license and other images, the shirts cost between $65 and $95 - a small fortune in a country where about half of the population lives in poverty."We're not trying to make an apology for drug trafficking, to glamorize it in the way that the media does," insists Marroquin, 39, who was born Juan Pablo Escobar Henao, but changed his name to avoid reprisals after his father's death.In a bid to head off criticism that the line glorifies drug crime, the shirts carry messages to provoke reflection. One bearing Escobar's student card reads: "What's your future looking like?" while a design emblazoned with his driver's license warns: "Nice pace, but wrong way."The cotton shirts, which went on sale last year in Mexico, are selling well in stores in Culiacan, the capital of western Sinaloa state, which is home of Mexico's most wanted trafficker, Sinaloa cartel chief Joaquin "Shorty" Guzman.The clothing is also on sale in Guadalajara in western Jalisco state, long a refuge for drug traffickers, which has been swept up in Mexico's raging drug violence. About 60,000 lives have been lost in the last six years.Analysts warn that the increasingly popular 'Escobar Henao' clothing line simply reinforces an already widespread fascination with the symbols of cartel culture such as marijuana leaves and AK-47s among youngsters in Mexico."I see it as a strong symbolic product," said Vicente Sanchez, a researcher at Mexico's Colegio de la Frontera Norte. "The state ... has to have a better grasp of things directed at young people, as that's the way that these anti-values gain ground," he added.But Marroquin, who has stores in Austria, Guatemala and the United States as well as Mexico, dismisses criticism, pointing to others who cashed in on his legacy. There are plenty of books on Escobar's exploits and even a Colombian television soap opera, "Pablo Escobar: The Boss of Evil" that aired this year."Those who set out to criticize me are the same who have profited from the story, life and name of Pablo Escobar," Marroquin told Reuters in an interview on Skype.The 39-year-old has said he held off opening stores in Colombia out of respect for drug trafficking victims there.Despite the success of the clothing line in Mexico and other markets, Marroquin insists that there has been an enduring downside to his father's legacy that has followed the family in the 19 years since his death."In 1994, we left Colombia ... but because of our surname, we couldn't get a passport anywhere in the world ... for the crime of having Escobar DNA," says Marroquin, who lives in Argentina. "We have lived liked criminals without being them."(Writing by Tim Gaynor; Editing by Simon Gardner and Stacey Joyce)	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	4	3	4

454	park-defends-refusal-wolves-184423303	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — The National Park Service acted properly when it ruled out using wolves to control the elk population in Rocky Mountain National Park, government lawyers argued Thursday before a federal appeals court.The government also defended the use of trained volunteers to help Park Service employees shoot and kill excess elk, saying it didn't violate a hunting ban in national parks.In a hearing before the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a law student representing the wildlife advocacy group WildEarth Guardians argued the Park Service did not give enough consideration to the wolf option and rejected it without giving the public a chance to comment.The group also said letting volunteers shoot elk instead of limiting the shooting to Park Service employees was tantamount to hunting.WildEarth Guardians sued the Park Service in 2008, asking a Denver federal judge to overturn the park's elk-thinning policy. The judge upheld the policy last year, and WildEarth Guardians appealed to the 10th Circuit.The appeals court normally meets in Denver but heard this case at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder as part of an outreach program. The judges did not say when they would rule.Rocky Mountain National Park sometimes has so many elk that they overgraze the vegetation, leaving other animals without enough food and habitat. Few natural predators are left there, and hunting is prohibited, so little remains to keep the elk population in check.The park launched a 20-year program in 2008 to thin the herd by having park employees and trained volunteers under park supervision periodically shoot and kill elk. The program also includes fences to protect vegetation from elk and redistributing some of the animals.Officials said reintroducing wolves to control elk numbers was infeasible. They cited a lack of support from other agencies, safety concerns of people who live nearby, expected conflicts between wolves and humans and the amount of attention that a wolf population would require of park officials.Park spokeswoman Kyle Patterson said 131 elk have been killed in the culling program during since 2008.The current size of the herd in the park's lower elevations is 600 to 800, which is within the target range set by the program, so no elk were killed last winter.No decision has been made on whether or how many elk will be killed this coming winter.Wolves disappeared from much of the West after decades of hunting and government-backed extermination. They were re-introduced in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in 1995, and some advocates have argued for bringing them back elsewhere.___Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP___Online:National Park Service fact sheet: http://1.usa.gov/UllcuKWildEarth Guardians: http://bit.ly/T94CDm	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	1	2	3	4

456	pentagon-dont-tweet-former-seals-bin-laden-book-202939677	While the Pentagon is still mulling over , it is sure about one thing: it doesn't want any of its employees tweeting about that guy's best-selling book. Today, the reports the Defense Department has issued guidelines on handling No Easy Day, the blow-by-blow memoir about the mission to kill Osama bin Laden and employees are prohibited from tweeting, Facebooking, or using their work email to discuss the book. They are allowed, however, to purchase a copy of it—and they Pentagon doesn't even mind if they put on a bookshelf rather than, as Scarborough writes, "special containers for classified information." Scaborough describes the four other rules as follows:Workers “shall not discuss potentially classified and sensitive unclassified information with persons who do not have an official need to know and an appropriate security clearance.”People with first-hand knowledge of the raid “shall not publicly speculate or discuss potentially classified or sensitive unclassified information outside official U.S. Government channels.”And, finally, employees “are prohibited from using unclassified government computer systems to discuss potentially classified or sensitive contents of [No Easy Day], and must not engage in online discussions via social networking or media sites regarding potentially classified or sensitive unclassified information that may be contained in [No Easy Day].”The crackdown on discussion about the book, which has been widely dissected in and an , summons the memory of materials: Things the public and the press already know a lot about, but the government has to pretend is top secret. As reported last week, according to Publisher's Weekly the book sold 253,000 hard copies in its first week, a calculation that doesn't even include Walmart sales. It's safe to say, if there's classified material in the book, the secret's out!	2	4	3	4	2	2	1	2	4	2	4	3	1	1	1	4

In the beginning of the game, it was almost like you could hear people talking and I'm just trying to focus, you know what I'm saying?"So I think for me it would probably have been better if we had a packed house."Pettitte was not at his sharpest, having to pitch out of first-and-third jams in the second, third and fourth innings, but when he needed to, he was able to coax a ground ball that helped him escape danger.Yankees manager Joe Girardi was pleased."He pitched out of some jams, got some important strikeouts. He did a really good job," said the skipper.Asked how much Pettitte could help the Yankees, whose 10-game AL East lead in July has evaporated with the charge put on by the red-hot Orioles, Girardi said: "A lot. There's a lot of experience there and he knows how to get it done."Pettitte, who ended a one-year retirement from the Yankees to come back this season, said he was getting antsy to pitch."When you see these guys go through what they've been going through and I've been sitting here watching, trying to cheer-lead for them, it's just great to be able to go out there and contribute a little bit," he said."Any time you win at this time of the year is precious."Girardi said having Pettitte back was big."You have confidence in Andy because he knows how to get that double play ball, get that strikeout and make the big pitch, and know he's not going to be overwhelmed by the situation."Pettitte, who improved to 4-3, threw 75 pitches, right at the limit Girardi had set for him in his return. He gave up four hits, walked two and struck out three."I didn't think my command was as sharp as I would like. But it's obviously a good win and I'll take it," said Pettitte, a perfectionist who has thrived in the postseason and tops Major League Baseball's all-time list with 19 postseason wins. "It's good to get out there and compete with these guys."My arm feels great. I'm 100 percent. I just have to get my legs back in shape and get my pitch count up so I can get us late into games."Pettitte, winner of five World Series rings with the Yanks, said the team expects the race to go down to the wire."We know this is going to be a dog fight," added Pettitte, who said the team saw highlights of Tuesday night's 18-inning win by the Orioles over Seattle before Wednesday's game."Obviously, you'd love to see them lose some games, but we just need to keep winning, keep playing well."(Editing by Frank Pingue)	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	4	3	2	3	2	2	1	3	4
459	philippines-muslim-rebels-close-peace-deal-151550203	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine government and Muslim rebels resumed talks Tuesday on resolving final differences in a preliminary peace accord they hope to conclude soon, in what is expected to be a major breakthrough toward ending a decades-long rebellion in the country's south.Government negotiators met with representatives of the 11,000-strong Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to attempt to seal what they call a "framework agreement" on major issues, including the extent of power, revenues and territory to be granted to a Muslim-administered region. It would be the most significant progress in years of negotiations on ending a rebellion that has left more than 120,000 people dead and held back development in the south.Western governments have long been worried that rebel strongholds could become breeding grounds for al-Qaida-affiliated extremists.Rebel negotiator Mohagher Iqbal said at the talks' resumption that they are "now on the home stretch and the smell of success is reinforced every day."Iqbal warned that if the negotiations are not concluded soon, opponents might endanger a final deal. A breakaway rebel group has opposed the talks, and some Christian politicians, wary of losing land and power to minority Muslims, have been accused of undermining the negotiations."If we cannot conclude it soon successfully, now that we are at the brink of the exercise, we will be in trouble," Iqbal said. "The greatest source of risk comes from spoilers, leaders, and parties who believe that these ... negotiations threaten their power and interests."Government negotiator Marvic Leonen said that "to state that what we hope to be able to do again in the next few days is historical is definitely an understatement.""We are on the brink of layering the written predicates that can frame the process of building trust as we usher in an era of peace, of hope and of recovery," Leonen said.The Moro rebel group has been fighting for self-rule for minority Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation's south. It dropped a demand for a separate Muslim state and now seeks an expansion of an existing Muslim autonomous region and more powers and resources to rehabilitate the violent, poverty-wracked area.The initial accord is to contain general agreements on key issues. A transition commission would be established to work out the details of the preliminary pact, which would hopefully lead to a final accord in as little as three years, Iqbal has said.In 2008, the planned signing of a preliminary pact was scuttled when opponents went to the Supreme Court, which declared the agreement unconstitutional, prompting three rebel commanders to attack Christian communities in the south. The attacks and an ensuing military offensive killed more than 100 people and displaced about 750,000 villagers before a cease-fire was forged.Last August, a rebel faction opposed to the talks attacked several army camps and outposts in southern Maguindanao and North Cotabato provinces, sparking two weeks of sporadic fighting that left more than 50 dead and displaced 45,000 others. The new unrest eased after the military launched a crackdown.	4	4	4	3	4	3	2	3	3	2	3	1	1	2	3	4
460	philippines-oscar-hope-drama-aging-gay-man-014125313	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — An independent drama that explores the loneliness and missed opportunities of an ailing, 70-year-old gay man is testing Philippine sensibilities about sexuality and hoping to advance in the Academy Awards' foreign-language film competition next year."Bwakaw," or "Voracious," has received positive reviews and local awards and is doing the rounds of international film festivals in Toronto, New York, Hawaii and Tokyo.Writer and director Jun Robles Lana says the movie is named after a stray dog with a voracious appetite for life that has a bond with the main character, Rene. Bwakaw's zest for life contrasts with Rene's grumpy disposition.Rene came out of the closet in his twilight years, thinks it is too late for love and only awaits his own death. He has made a will and labeled his few possessions to be given away to friends. He even bought a coffin at a funeral home's closing-out sale.But when Bwakaw dies after an illness, Rene, played by veteran actor Eddie Garcia, finds new appreciation for life. "It's the dog that basically teaches him to live life to the fullest," Lana said in an interview Wednesday."It's really more about loneliness, although you can't help that some people or critics are branding it a gay film simply because the character is gay, but that's really beside the point," he said.Lana admits that while Filipinos are generally gay-friendly — the most popular movie star is Vice Ganda, an out-and-out gay comedian — local mainstream audiences might not be too receptive to a serious take on homosexuality in the conservative and predominantly Roman Catholic society."We tend to look at gay characters as iconic, funny characters," he said. "So when you make a movie like this, you really have to market it in such a way that it would be more appealing to them."He said that the movie focuses on the comedy aspect in order to appeal to a wider audience.But the filmmaker hopes that between the laughs, moviegoers will find that it is more than a comedy.He said he made the film with the intention to honor his mentor, writer Rene Villanueva, who died in 2007. He described Villanueva, who came out as gay later in his life, as generous and harsh at the same time, and an inspiration for the main character, Rene.Lana said the drama "eventually became a story about growing old, missed opportunities, about how desire is inextricable from our lives."For Lana, who started in art house films but has for the last few years been mainly involved in commercial movies, "Bwakaw" was also "a return to my roots.""I did not expect this film which I made for very personal reasons would resonate with so many people and not just Filipinos," he said. "I'm really just thankful for all the wonderful things going our way."The Philippines has submitted entries to the Academy Awards for many years but has never been nominated or even short-listed."Bwakaw" is one of around 40 films entered in the foreign-language category this year. The list is to be pared to 10 late this year and to the final five nominees by January.	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	2	4	4

463	plane-going-everest-region-crashes-killing-19-040304213	KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) — A plane carrying trekkers into the Everest region crashed just after takeoff Friday morning in Nepal's capital, killing all 19 people on board, authorities said.The pilot reported trouble two minutes after takeoff, and Katmandu airport official Ratish Chandra Suman said the plane appeared to have been trying to turn back to the airport. Suman said he could not confirm if the plane was already on fire before it crashed.The twin-engine propeller plane belonging to domestic Sita Air crashed onto open ground near the Manohara River on the southwest edge of Katmandu. The morning weather was clear.Firefighters brought the fire in the wreckage under control and police rescuers were trying to pull out the bodies, Katmandu airport police chief Narayan Bastakoti said.Seven passengers were British while five were Chinese, Bastakoti said. The other three passengers and the four crew members were from Nepal.The plane was heading for Lukla, the gateway to Mount Everest. Thousands of Westerners make treks in the region around the world's highest peak each year. Autumn is considered the best time to trek the foothills of the Himalayan peaks.The crash follows an avalanche on another Nepal peak Sunday that killed seven foreign climbers and a Nepali guide.	2	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	1	3	1	1	3	3	4

467	polls-rigged-against-mitt-romney-093000016--election	The latest polls show President Obama widening his lead over Mitt Romney in Ohio and Florida, crucial swing states, but the Romney campaign rejects the idea that the tide is turning in favor of the Democrats. Republican skeptics say the polls are wrong because the people conducting them are interviewing too many Democrats and too few Republicans, exaggerating Obama's support and underestimating Romney's. Are the major polls skewed against Romney? Here, a brief guide:How much of a lead do the polls give Obama?Obama is ahead by six percentage points among registered voters, and by five percentage points among those most likely to show up at the polls, according to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. In Ohio, a state that no Republican presidential nominee has won the presidency without, Obama is ahead 53 percent to 43 percent among likely voters, according to a new Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll. Real Clear Politics says that the average poll has Obama ahead with 48.7 percent to Romney's 45 percent nationwide, with a five-percentage point lead in Ohio and a three-point edge in Florida. Pro-Romney skeptics say the polls — all of them — are biased in Obama's favor.SEE MORE: 4 ways Mitt Romney can defuse his '47 percent disaster'What do they think is the problem?The skeptics say that pollsters are choosing their sample sizes based on the assumption that the 2012 turnout will be similar to 2008's, when record numbers of Democratic-leaning Latino, black, and young voters went to the polls. This year, though, some of those Democrats have grown disillusioned, and Republicans eager to deny Obama a second term are more motivated than they were four years ago, Romney supporters say. "I don't think [the polls] reflect the composition of what 2012 is going to look like," Romney pollster Neil Newhouse says. Some polls even forecast a turnout even more favorable to Obama than in 2008, GOP consultant Rick Wilson says in the New York Daily News, "which even Obama's most dedicated partisans think is highly unlikely."Why do Republicans think the pollsters are getting it wrong?They say they smell a rat. "The Democrats want to convince [anti-Obama voters] falsely that Romney will lose to discourage them from voting," Republican pollsters John McLaughlin tells National Review. "So they lobby the pollsters to weight their surveys to emulate the 2008 Democrat-heavy models." One conservative blogger, Dean Chambers, has even created a website called unskewedpolls.com where he adjusts the data according to assumptions by automated pollster Rasmussen Reports, which tends to favor Republicans, and concludes that Romney has led Obama 52 percent to 44 percent in the average poll since Labor Day.SEE MORE: 3 paths to electoral victory for Mitt RomneyAre the complaints valid?According to pollsters, they're ridiculous. Poll takers do weight their samples according to demographic traits, such as race, gender, and age. Party identification, though, is something their polls should measure, not control. The nation is roughly evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, with a smaller group of independents in between, but there's usually a "party-ID gap" at the polls that reflects the mood of the electorate (Democrats had a seven-point edge, 39 percent to 32 percent, in 2008). If pollsters try to even out the numbers artificially, says Doug Schwartz, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, "they are substituting their own judgment as to what the electorate is going to look like. It's not scientific."So are the polls unfairly skewed against Romney, or not?Look, says Jim Geraghty at National Review, "a split of D+7 or more is excessive." A Democratic turnout advantage of three or four percentage points — halfway between the GOP peak of 2010 and the Democratic one of 2008 — is more fair. If pollsters think Dems can count on another historical high, they should at least "explain why." Pollsters say their critics are underestimating the weight of minorities in the electorate. The fast-growing Latino population, for example, favors Obama over Romney, who drifted to the right on immigration during the GOP primaries. Not only that, says Steve Benen at MSNBC, but the notion that pollsters — "literally, all of them" — would be "deliberately publishing bogus poll results is pretty silly." Silly, but predictable, says Doug Mataconis at Outside the Beltway. "The 'biased polling' argument is just a sub-set of the 'biased media' argument" conservatives have flogged for decades. You can bet that if Team Romney's internal polls were better, they'd be leaking them. They're not, because polling is a science, and the trend is clear. If you deny it... well, "That's not skepticism, that's partisan spin."SEE MORE: Mitt Romney releases his 2011 tax return: 4 takeawaysSources: The Hill, MSNBC, National Journal, National Review (2), New York Daily News, The New York Times, Outside the Beltway, The Wall Street JournalRead more political coverage at The Week's 2012 Election Center.SEE MORE: Was Mitt Romney really the GOP's best candidate?View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	4	3	4	2	3	3	4
468	poulter-keeps-europeans-hunt-ryder-cup-000130320--spt	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) — Ian Poulter and Europe aren't ready to concede the Ryder Cup, winning the last two matches and bringing the American juggernaut to a screeching halt.The Americans still have a10-6 lead, but that looks tight compared to the blowout they were on the verge of only a few hours earlier Saturday. The U.S. needs 14 ½ points to regain the Ryder Cup. The largest comeback in Ryder Cup history was at Brookline in 1999, when the U.S. erased a 10-6 deficit on the final day."It's been done before," Europe captain Jose Maria Olazabal said.Don't count Europe out, not with Poulter. The excitable Englishman loves the Ryder Cup, and has his team's best winning percentage to back it up. He's now 11-3-0 in Ryder Cup play, and has had a hand in half of Europe's points so far.This might have been his best performance yet. Down 2 with six holes to play, Poulter made five straight birdies and he and Rory McIlroy stunned Jason Dufner and Zach Johnson 1 up. With his entire team watching, Poulter drained a 12-footer to clinch the match then let out a roar that might have been heard across the Atlantic.	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	3	2	3	4
469	presidential-decathlon-obama-winning-213521154--abc-news-politics	Presidential campaigns aren't decided on the last day of a race. They are decided in all the days and moments leading up to Election Day. They turn toward the candidate who puts together a lead going into the final voting in November, and who won or lost the important moments along the way.In that way, this race in its final months is like a decathlon. Instead of individual sporting events, it is the combination of 10 moments that determines which candidate has the most points on Nov. 6.Thus far, I would suggest there are have been five moments of significance. President Obama has either won or tied in each of these, allowing him to build up a small but significant lead. Polls, when considered as a group, speak to this lead, revealing a race that right now is trending overall (and in all important states) as somewhere between a 1-point and 6-point Obama advantage. Nearly every poll falls within this range.I have listened to many Republicans try to point to one poll as indicative of the race and ignore all the other data available. This is what I call confirmation bias. It is when we ignore information that runs counter to what we want to hear and we look for information that confirms what we desire. It happens all the time - in politics, and in life.They'll need to abandon that tendency if they aim to win any of the important moments coming up in the next seven weeks.Let's look at five moments already conducted, then the five moments still on the horizon.So far, Romney basically tied in his best event, which was picking a vice-presidential nominee - Paul Ryan. He spent 10 days talking about something other than the economy and ended up with little to no bump. His next best event was the Republican convention, and at best you can say he tied this. The biggest take away was from a fading actor, Clint Eastwood, talking to an empty chair.The next event on the calendar was the Democratic convention, and President Obama won this going away, and ended up getting a pretty good bounce from it. Though the bounce didn't completely last, it did settle into a pretty important 3-point lead.Interestingly, the next two moments in the campaign were spontaneous ones that no one could have predicted. First was the Libyan tragedy and violence. In this case, the public judged Obama to have handled the crisis calmly and effectively while Mitt Romney's precipitous statements were viewed by many voters negatively. An Obama win in this event.Another unpredictable moment came with the release and coverage of a tape of Romney at a fundraiser in which the candidate talked disapprovingly of 47 percent of the country - an unforced error but a Romney loss in this event.So we are left with five events to come that include three presidential debates in October, one vice-presidential debate, and an unpredictable moment.In order for Romney and his campaign to get back in this race and have a chance on Election Day, they are going to have to win convincingly at least three of these remaining five moments. And with voting already beginning early in many states, Romney is probably going to need to do very well in that first debate in Denver. That could be a make-or-break moment for his campaign.The only way the Romney campaign can achieve all this is by accepting reality for what it is, not convincing itself anymore that everything is fine. His team must make a real change in the relationship they have with the voters they need to win in this election. And like in life, the first sign of self-respect is taking real accountability for how they got in this mess and accepting the hard truth of what they need to do to succeed. Let's see if they have hit rock bottom and can turn things around for the five events left.	4	4	4	3	4	2	2	3	3	2	3	3	1	1	4	3
470	private-space-travel-gets-big-boost-california-115952924	As NASA's space shuttle Endeavour orbiter flew to its retirement home in sunny California today (Sept. 21), Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. signed legislation to bolster the commercial spaceflight sector in that state.The Assembly bill limits liability for private spaceflight companies.“California aerospace pioneers like Virgin Galactic, SpaceX and the Spaceship Company are blazing a path to the stars with commercial space travel,” Brown said in a statement. “This bill allows commercial space-travel companies to innovate and explore without the worry of excessive liability.”A summary overview of Assembly Bill 2243 shows that it provides qualified immunity from liability to a spaceflight entity for injuries to a space flight participant, so long as a written warning statement is provided to the participant and the injury was not the result of spaceflight entity's gross negligence or intentional acts. [Now Boarding: The Top 10 Private Spaceships]The bill requires a spaceflight entity to have each participant sign a “prescribed warning statement” acknowledging that the participant understands the “inherent risks associated with space flight activity, including death, and also acknowledging that the space flight entity has limited liability for injuries or damages sustained by a participant as a result of these inherent risks.”High desertLeading the measure that was targeted to an emerging industry in California was Assemblyman Steve Knight (R-Palmdale). Last August, the bill unanimously passed in both houses of the California State Legislature.Knight also said in a statement that, until recently, human space travel was accomplished through government space agencies, with volunteer participants assuming liability for injury and damage. Assembly Bill 2243 provides limited liability for commercial space ventures to ensure innovators remain competitive in this promising marketplace.“California, and specifically the High Desert, has a long tradition of pioneering aviation for a century, and human spaceflight since the Apollo era, and was the site of the first private human space flight event, which resulted in the winning of the Ansari X Prize in Mojave, California, in 2004,” Knight said.History of spaceflightOver the past few decades, Knight added, California has lost a significant slice of its human spaceflight industry development to other states, specifying Alabama, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Texas. The human spaceflight business in California, he said, continues to struggle due to the poor business climate in general, and the current litigious environment.“The history of space flight and California are inseparable,” Knight said. “Providing the commercial space industry with a competitive advantage will ensure our state maintains and possibly gains jobs in this important market.”The bill-signing was praised by Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson, who called California a state that tears down barriers and cultivates innovation, from social movements like environmentalism to the start-up culture of Silicon Valley.Branson called the bill a benefit to the teams at Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Co. at the Mojave Air and Space Port — the construction site of the WhiteKnightTwo/SpaceShipTwo launch system.“This legislation will ensure that California continues to be a place that looks forward … and not back,” Branson said.For a complete look at the newlegislation, visit: http://leginfo.ca.gov/bilinfo.html and enter Assembly Bill 2243.Leonard David has been reporting on the space industry for more than five decades.

471	produced-election-night-coverage-171900395	This is an assignment memorandum for the producers of election night coverage. I feel I am modestly qualified to make these assignments because of my past experience covering politics at the network level, and because this year, I might well be — for the first time — a viewer.The great gadgets and graphics and gimmicks are fun to watch.SEE ALSO: Decoding the next two monthsBut there are a couple of dynamic data points that everyone who has followed the race closely and those who are just tuning it for the drama will want to know.The three Big Stories of the night are obvious: Will Obama get re-elected? Will Republicans take control of the Senate? Will they hang on to the House?SEE ALSO: Abuse allegations splinter U.S. speed skating teamIf I were producing the coverage, I'd make sure that, at all times in the lower third of the screen space, we'd have a graphic showing the current and projected advantage for Republicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate. These numbers ought to be automatically updated to reflect new projections. That is, let's say that it's 9:00 p.m. ET, and based on the races that have been called and projected so far, Democrats are clinging to a one-seat Senate majority. Right now, Democrats have a four-seat edge (two independents caucusing as Democrats, the vice presidential tie breaker, and 51 seats to their name). So the two data points that could be useful right at that moment would show the current composition (53) and the projected composition (51). But the more accurate graphic would show how many seats Republicans need to win to flip the chamber. And that's four, not three. So producers: Your graphic should look something like this. It should be on screen at all times, or rotated with the House control graphic, which I'll describe next.U.S. SENATESEE ALSO: The NFL needs to give in, nowNOW: D +4PROJECTED: D+2SEE ALSO: The American ambassador to Libya is murderedThe House graphics are a bit more complicated. Republicans control 242 seats and Democrats control 193. But this tells the casual viewer very little. Republicans have a 25-seat advantage in the House. So the House graphic would read:NOW: R+25SEE ALSO: The dead cat livesPROJECTED: R+12The font would be slightly different for the projected make-up, and it would attest to its dynamic status. Since polls in Hawaii and Alaska don't close until very late, networks have to use projections. What makes the second part of the graphic interesting is that it can be updated in real-time to reflect House projections and real-vote returns that come in. (All networks use essentially the same computer back-end to crunch the numbers; their projection models differ slightly based on the political scientists and analysts who serve on the decision desks.) As the PROJECTED number is updated, it can flash — and anchors/reporters can explain (briefly) why the projection has changed, and perhaps the races that have been called can also flash on the screen. The graphic does not perfectly correspond to the 435 individual House elections because some can't be called even though the winner might be obvious. But the computer models will take the safe seats into account and the human modelers will make responsible projections.SEE ALSO: 5 ways Romney can still winNow, to the presidency. The magic number is 270 electoral votes. There are two ways to handle this. One is to simply show the projected electoral votes for each candidate in real-time.CURRENT EV (269 NOT CALLED)SEE ALSO: Welcome to The CompassROMNEY + 145OBAMA + 124SEE ALSO: The president for the upper halfAnother would show how many EVs are needed.TO WIN (300 of 538 NOT CALLED)SEE ALSO: When a gaffe isn'tROMNEY needs 100OBAMA needs 29SEE ALSO: No easy answers for No Easy DayAnother rotating graphic could show SCENARIOS to victory. They'd be in shorthand:ROMNEY'S PATH NOW: WINNING OH, CO, NV, AND NMSEE ALSO: Why Apple's events matterOBAMA'S PATH NOW: WINNING CO AND NV, OR IA AND NVBut here's where networks can get creative.SEE ALSO: Apparently, it's not just the economy (stupid?)They'll have data to show where lies the outstanding vote, and in each state, it is fairly easy to write a formula that allows an anchor to say something like: "In Ohio, about 14,000 votes separate President Obama from Mitt Romney, but Romney needs to win about 56 percent of the outstanding precincts — precincts that tend to give Republicans 60 percent of their vote. So Ohio looks good for Romney, based on the turnout models that we have."On screen, you'd see:OHIO (18 EVs)SEE ALSO: A premortem obituary for Romney is prematureOBAMA: 392,303 — 52 percentROMNEY: 378,304 — 48 percentSEE ALSO: When the shuttle landedMargin: 14,000Precincts reporting: 43 percentSEE ALSO: Romney's theory of provocative weaknessTilt to precincts not yet reporting: 60 percent GOP-----------------At this point, John King, Chuck Todd, and their maps can go to town. But rarely do networks actually quantify the projected outstanding vote in states, and I don't know why. They have the data (I've seen it), and it anchors the drama of the night in reality.The exit poll data and the real-vote tracking ability of the networks is truly awesome on election night, and for the sake of viewers, I think it ought to be incorporated into the graphical crawls more easily.Technically, there are no impediments. But producers need to think through these things in advance as they figure out how to tell the story on election night, a story that is largely numerical.View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	4	4	4	4	4	1	3	3	3	4	3	3	1	1	3	3
472	proof-star-treks-warp-drive-might-actually-182000581	Star Trek fans know that the Starship Enterprise zips around the universe — and escapes some seriously hairy situations — with warp drive, a technology that allows Captain Kirk and Co. to move faster than the speed of light. Warp drive may seem far-fetched to some (Mel Brooks once mocked it as "Ludicrous Speed" in his comedy Space Balls), but it's actually related to the theory that space-time, the fabric of space, can be manipulated to allow objects to move faster than photons of light. And now a NASA scientist, Harold White, says he has created a feasible model for warp drive, building on a theory expounded by Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994. Here, a guide to these far-out findings:What's the history of this warp-drive theory? Alcubierre was the first scientist to come up with a model for warp drive. Imagine a football-shaped spacecraft attached to a ring that would constantly encircle it. The ring, potentially made of exotic matter (or theoretical particles), would somehow cause space-time to warp. "By creating one of these warp bubbles, the spaceship's engine will compress the space ahead and expand the space behind, moving it to another place without actually moving," says Jesus Diaz at Gizmodo. The problem? The energy needed to warp space equals "the mass-energy of Jupiter," says Shane McGlaun at TechnaBob.Okay. So what has this NASA scientist discovered? White says Alcubierre's model would be far more energy efficient with a ring shaped like a rounded doughnut, instead of a flat ring. In addition, White says "the intensity of the space warps can be oscillated over time," further reducing the energy required, says Clara Moskowitz at Space.com. With these adjustments, White says his warp drive can be powered with a "mass about the size of a spacecraft like the Voyager 1 probe NASA launched in 1977." All in all, his warp drive model would move objects at 10 times the speed of light.How is he testing his theory? "White and his colleagues have begun experimenting with a mini-version of the warp drive in their laboratory," says Moskowitz. They are using a "laser interferometer" to make miniscule versions of space-time warps, in what White has described as a "tabletop experiment."Is warp drive really necessary? Yes! "With our current propulsion technologies, interstellar flight is impossible," says Diaz. And even if scientists could summon the energy to propel a space craft to another star, "it will require decades — centuries even — to get there." If humans are "ever going to become a true spacefaring civilization, we're going to have to think outside the box a little bit," Richard Obousy, president of Icarus Interstellar, tells Space.com.Sources: Gizmodo, SlashGear, Space.com, TechnaBob, VentureBeatView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	4	4	3	4	3	4	1	4	3	2	3	2	2	1	3	4
473	protests-threaten-georgian-leaders-grip-power-143321364	TBILISI (Reuters) - Nana Dumbadze was all set to vote for Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili's party in an election next week. That is, until she saw television footage of prisoners being raped.The 37-year-old teacher was so shocked that she has decided to switch allegiance from the leader of the Rose Revolution that swept out the ex-Soviet old guard in 2003 to an opposition bloc, Georgian Dream, led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili.The prison brutality scandal, which has ignited protests, has left Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM) facing an unexpectedly tough battle to keep power in the volatile Caucasus state, a transit route for oil and gas to the West.It has raised the stakes for Saakashvili. He has promised to leave the presidency next year and needs a UNM victory in the October 1 parliamentary election to keep a hand on Georgia's reins and avoid the risk of political oblivion.The parliament will have stronger powers after next year's presidential election and Saakashvili could steer an ally into the post of prime minister with enhanced authority or take the job himself, though he is not expected to do that."I'd intended to vote for Saakashvili's party but after watching what we've all seen on TV I've changed my mind and will vote for the opposition now," Dumbadze said. "I think it's immoral to vote for this government."Dumbadze described asking her mother to make sure her two sons, aged seven and 10, do not see the footage on television while she is away at work or on errands.The scandal has dimmed the image the pro-Western, U.S.-educated Saakashvili cultivated as a reformer who has curbed corruption and ushered in democracy, handing ammunition to foes who say he has actually trampled on rights and freedoms.The grim footage has enabled Ivanishvili, a once-reclusive tycoon who has a spectacular glass and steel house overlooking Tbilisi, to call the vote "a choice between good and evil".Saakashvili, 44, became the West's political darling when he rose to power after the bloodless revolution that toppled Eduard Shevardnadze, a former Soviet foreign minister.But opponents have accused Saakashvili of monopolizing power and criticized him for leading Georgia into a disastrous five-day war with Russia in 2008. His promise to take Georgia into NATO remains unfulfilled and has soured relations with Moscow.The abuse scandal has increased tensions before the vote, prompting calls for restraint from the West.The opposition says 60 supporters have been detained by police, describing an "atmosphere of fear and intimidation". The ruling party says supporters have been attacked by protesters and urged the six-party Georgian Dream to reject violence.Saakashvili's government says the video, which shows guards beating, punching and humiliating prisoners, as well as inmates being raped with various objects, was recorded by guards who were bribed by "politically motivated persons".But Saaskashvili has also promised to clean up the jails. His interior and prisons ministers have resigned. The Tbilisi prison chief, two deputies and several guards have been arrested."I think they did quite well in reacting," said Thomas de Waal, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. Whether it will be enough for Saakashvili's party to hold onto power is less clear.FADED ROSE?An opinion poll in August put UNM on 37 percent support against 12 percent for Georgian Dream and showed 43 percent of respondents could vote either way. No polls have appeared since the protests but the opposition is expected to make gains."I think that these events will have a huge impact on the election and will overshadow the nihilism, illusions and the government's propaganda," said Shorena Shaverdashvili, editor-in-chief of the independent Liberal magazine.De Waal said the abuse scandal would "help support the opposition narrative in Georgia that the government has built a facade which hides unpleasant realities and has failed to improve the lives of ordinary people.""But the opposition is still less well mobilized and hasn't been able to articulate very well what it is offering instead and the electoral system also favors the ruling party, so I still expect the UNM to win more seats on October 1," he added.Many Georgians just want better living standards."I'll vote for anyone whose promises seem the most realistic," said Lali Narmania, 58, who lives in a shabby apartment on Tbilisi's outskirts with her disabled husband and son, existing on a monthly state allowance of 250 lari ($150).Narmania is unemployed and her husband is bedridden by a wound from the 1992-1993 war in which the Black Sea region of Abkhazia broke from Tbilisi's control.Georgia's economy, hit by the war and the global financial crisis, has been growing again since 2010. But inflation was 11.2 percent that year and the government expects a rate of 6-7 percent this year after a dip to 2 percent in 2011.Saakashvili was hailed by the West as a shining example for his promise to clean up the corruption, rigged elections and economic stagnation that blighted Georgia's first decade of independence after the Soviet Union collapsed.His team restored 24-hour electricity and clamped down on police bribe-taking, and the economy took off before the war and crisis. But critics accuse him of curbing democracy, persecuting opponents, pressuring courts and controlling the media.The war with Russia put Abkhazia and the rebel region of South Ossetia, both now recognized by Moscow as independent nations, further from Georgia's reach. Russian leaders depict Saakashvili as a hothead itching to take the regions by force.Saakashvili, for his part, says President Vladimir Putin wants to gain sway over a country that was under Russian or Soviet control for almost two centuries. He has called the abuse scandal "Russian mud" financed with "Russian money"."Those who thought that they could carry out Putin's orders in our country will be very disappointed," Saakashvili told supporters on Sunday in Zugdidi in western Georgia.Ivanishvili, who has sold the Russian assets that were a chunk of his estimated $6.4 billion, says Saakashvili is playing the "Russian card" to draw attention away from internal problems. "Saakashvili just wants you to forget about what you've all seen," Ivanishvili told a crowd in Zugdidi.(Reporting by Margarita Antidze; Editing by Steve Gutterman and Timothy Heritage)	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	3	3	2	3	2	1	2	4	4
474	psychopaths-poor-sense-smell-study-finds-190855932	New research suggests we may be able to sniff out psychopaths by their poor scores on a smell test.In the study, psychologists at Macquarie University in Australia tested the noses of more than 70 college-age participants, all without criminal records. The researchers had the subjects try to identify common odors (like orange, coffee and leather) and distinguish between different scents.The participants then were given personality tests to check for their level of empathy and psychopathic tendencies. For example, the subjects were asked to rate on a 5-point scale how much they agreed with statements such as: "I purposely flatter people to get them on my side;" "People sometimes say that I'm cold-hearted;" and "I have broken into a building or vehicle in order to steal something or vandalize."Psycopathy is a personality disorder marked by superficial charm, a lack of empathy and impulsive tendencies.The researchers reported a correlation between a poorer sense of smell and psychopathic personality traits.They say this makes sense because previous research has shown that people with such traits have decreased function in the brain's frontal lobes, a region associated with impulse control and acting in accordance with social norms — and dysfunction in that part of the brain is associated with an impaired sense of smell.Criminal psychopaths' speech patterns can also give them away, according to research presented in 2011. When speaking of their crimes, psychopaths use less emotion and focus more on their basic needs than non-psychopaths, that research found.Psychopaths, believed to make up as much as 1 percent of the general population, may attempt to fake answers during psychological evaluations, so a measure of smelling ability could offer a helpful new way to detect psychopathic traits, the researchers said.The study, led by Mehmet K. Mahmut and Richard J. Stevenson, was published recently in the journal Chemosensory Perception.	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	3	3	3	2	1	2	2	4	3
475	putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421	MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that any attempt to unilaterally use force or interfere with events in the Middle East or North Africa would be counter-productive, rebutting growing calls to intervene in Syria's civil war.Russia and China have strongly opposed the idea of foreign intervention in Syria, vetoing three United Nations Security Council resolutions backed by Western and Arab states that would have increased pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to stop the bloodshed.Both countries have also voiced opposition to new sanctions on Iran and to any moves to attack it."Attempts to replace the universal principles of the U.N. Charter by unilateral actions or partisan deals, moreover to use force bypassing the U.N. do not do any good, as is well known," Putin told foreign ambassadors in the Kremlin, where he was receiving their new credentials.Putin said his warning concerned civil unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, adding that the U.N. Charter was meant to be used to solve problems "through negotiations, without external interference"."Incitement of violence in different forms in order to change the regime only pushes the situation into a dead end. Violence creates violence," Putin said.Putin's warning came as Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani told the U.N. General Assembly in New York that Arab nations should intervene in Syria given the U.N. Security Council's failure to stop the conflict there.The 18-month-old revolt, which began as peaceful street protests, has escalated into a civil war in which activists say over 27,000 people have died.Russia accused NATO of overstepping a U.N. Security Council mandate for a no fly zone over Libya last year to help rebels overthrow former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.Earlier this month, Putin condemned the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya but made it clear he believed Western support for rebels in Arab countries was fuelling chaos."Most recently we received proof that such a position is right. It is time to learn some lessons from what is going on," Putin said on Wednesday.Russia has also accused Western nations of encouraging Syrian rebels including armed extremists.(Reporting by Gleb Bryanski; Editing by Nastassia Astrasheuskaya and Andrew Osborn)	3	3	4	2	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	1	1	3	3	4

478	radvanovsky-takes-donizetti-queen-191548089	WASHINGTON (AP) — Early in the second act of Donizetti's opera "Anna Bolena," the heroine confronts her lady-in-waiting Jane Seymour, who confesses that she will soon replace her as the wife of Henry VIII.It's one of the great scenes in bel canto opera. And as performed by soprano Sondra Radvanovsky and mezzo-soprano Sonia Ganassi at the Washington National Opera on Tuesday night, it exploded off the stage and sent sparks flying into the auditorium at the Kennedy Center.It was the unmistakable high point of an evening that, despite a good deal of fine singing, otherwise never quite caught fire.Part of the problem was the visually imposing but heavy-handed staging by Stephen Lawless, part of it the limp conducting by Antonello Allemandi.And then there was Radvanovsky herself. This prodigiously gifted American soprano remains something of a work in progress.There was a lot to like in her first crack at this touchstone role, which the legendary Maria Callas restored to the modern repertory in 1957. The basic quality of Radvanovsky's voice can be thrilling — a penetrating sound that is hard-edged without being harsh. She unleashed astonishing power, especially at the top of her range (though she was not always able to scale back the volume when she should have). But there were still traces of her tendency to sing flat, and some of her phrasing was rhythmically imprecise.Dramatically, she has not yet found the emotional depth to portray the tragic queen as much more than the weepy victim of a conniving king. The one exception came in the encounter with Ganassi, when the Italian mezzo's own intensity seemed to jump-start her performance. Throughout the night, Ganassi used her ample, plummy voice to create an impassioned portrayal of a woman torn between her love for Henry and her pity for Anna.American bass Owen Gradus made a handsome, swaggering Henry, binge-eating and drinking as he engineered the trap that would rid him of his unwanted wife. He sang energetically, though his voice is a size too small for the role. Georgian tenor Shalva Mukeria displayed a pleasant, slightly nasal sound and nailed his many high notes as Anna's beloved Percy. British mezzo Claudia Huckle was impressive in the trousers role of the hapless page Smeton.The production, created for the Dallas Opera, uses a single set by Benoit Dugardyn consisting of large wooden panels that surround the stage and take different configurations as scenes change. Scenery is wheeled in or lowered from the flies. Choristers appear on two tiers of balconies above the walls. This allows for some striking tableaux as the figures overhead watch and comment on the action below.But Lawless has a way of belaboring the obvious, including his overuse of Anna's daughter, the young girl who would become Queen Elizabeth — and figure prominently in two subsequent Donizetti operas. The real Elizabeth was not yet 3 when Anna died and has no role in the opera as written. Played here as a girl of about 10, she is dragged into numerous scenes to witness her mother's degradation, even watching as Anna puts her head on the chopping block at the end. In a program note, Lawless speculates this may be why Elizabeth never married!There were other miscues, like the pantomime during the overture that showed Henry shedding one wife for the next, played incongruously for laughs. And it was a mistake to drop a large grill with prison bars during Anna's final scene, obscuring our view of her just when we should be focusing our eyes on nothing else.The production, which opened the company's season Saturday night, runs for six more performances through Oct. 6. For Radvanovsky, it's a warm-up for an even more demanding assignment: In coming seasons she will repeat the role at the Metropolitan Opera and will add the heroines of Donizetti's two other "queen" operas — "Maria Stuarda" and "Roberto Devereaux."	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	2	3	1	4	4

480	rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business	LONDON (Reuters) - The credit rating firm DBRS is in no rush to change its Spanish rating despite the country's worsening economy because stabilization measures such as the European Central Bank's new bond-buying program could start at any point.DBRS is one of four firms the ECB uses to rate collateral, but following serial downgrades from S&P, Fitch and Moody's, is the only one saving Spanish bonds from an extra 5 percent charge the ECB automatically applies to sub A-rated sovereign bonds used as collateral in its lending operations.Markets' eyes are currently trained on Moody's to see whether it strips Spain of its investment grade status as Madrid struggles with cash-strapped regions, an ailing bank system and rising debt refinancing costs.It delayed the decision on Tuesday to give itself until the end of the month, but some analysts believe a downgrade from Baa3 could help push Madrid to take EU aid.Despite that focus, a DBRS downgrade would do more real damage because unless they could find alternative assets, it would cut the amount of ECB money Spanish banks would be able to borrow.Madrid may be able to relax a little though. Fergus McCormick, head of sovereign ratings for DBRS, said the fact European help was waiting in the wings would spare Spain from any knee-jerk rating changes."In the context of a weak economic environment, an unclear policy response from Europe, and popular discontent in Spain, the higher deficits are worrying and place further downward pressure on our A (low) rating, which has a Negative trend," McCormick told Reuters."And yet, we are not going to jump to conclusions. Why? Because the backstop could come into play and stabilize bond markets, providing Spain time to reduce its deficit more gradually and implement tough structural reforms."He added there were a lot of unanswered questions on whether the euro zone's bailout funds will, as previously indicated, help to recapitalize Spain's banks, and also on how the ECB will deploy its new bond-buying program."We have no doubt that Europe has the ammunition to stabilize the situation. Whether it will use it remains to be seen," McCormick said in e-mailed comments.(Reporting by Marc Jones; editing by Stephen Nisbet)	3	3	3	3	3	4	2	3	2	2	3	3	2	3	3	4
481	ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl	(Reuters) - The Baltimore Ravens will be looking to avenge a heartbreaking loss that cost them a trip to the Super Bowl last season when they host the New England Patriots in primetime on Sunday for Week Three's marquee showdown.A missed 32-yard field goal from then Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff that likely would have sent the AFC Championship into overtime is the lasting memory of the Patriots' 23-20 win but the pain was particularly acute for some Baltimore veterans.Ed Reed, one of the finest free safeties of the past decade, considered retirement after the bitter disappointment of that January loss but decided to return for one more shot at a Super Bowl championship ring.On Sunday he comes face to face with the Patriots again but insists the defeat is no longer on his mind."That was last year. They only crowned one champ last year, if I'm not mistaken. It's behind us," Reed, 34, told reporters."We're a totally different team this year. We don't even have some of the same guys on the team. It's always a new year the next year. I know I'm not worried about what happened last year. It was over and done with after that game."The changes to the Ravens roster have been matched by some alterations in style with quarterback Joe Flacco making more use of the no-huddle offense but it remains the defense, with Reed and fellow veteran Ray Lewis, that is the defining aspect of the Baltimore team."They're very, very talented players, they play well within their scheme, and they complement each other well," said Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. "They're very physical, they're very tough, they're very smart and they really take advantage of bad offensive plays."I think more so than anything, they really capitalize on mistakes, so we've got to try to limit our mistakes."The Patriots have managed to do that pretty well against Baltimore - their only loss in seven meetings came in the 2009 season's wild card round, with Reed one of three Ravens to intercept Brady."He's pretty much ingrained permanently in my mind," Brady said. "He's such a playmaker for them, and he shows up in a lot of different spots."He has such a great understanding of what offenses are doing. He obviously studies hard; he competes incredibly hard, and if you make a mistake, he really capitalizes."In other action, the Miami Dolphins host the rival New York Jets on Sunday in an AFC East divisional clash that will have some extra spice as it marks Jets' offensive coordinator Tony Sparano's return to Miami, where he was a head coach before being fired last year.The New Orleans Saints, 2009 Super Bowl winners, look to avoid an 0-3 start when they host the Kansas City Chiefs who are also 0-2 this season."I'm optimistic that we're going to get this thing back on track very quickly," said Saints quarterback Drew Brees."Obviously we're disappointed by the 0-2 start, but there's nothing we can do about it now except learn from our mistakes."In contrast, two of the league's six unbeaten teams will meet in San Diego where the Chargers host the Atlanta Falcons.The 2-0 Houston Texans travel to Denver to face Peyton Manning and the 1-1 Broncos while Monday night's game sees the Green Bay Packers at the Seattle Seahawks.(Reporting by Simon Evans in Miami; Editing by Frank Pingue)	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	4	3	3	3	2	4	2	3	4
482	rays-eliminated-despite-5-3-win-over-orioles-054802326--mlb	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Joe Maddon planned to sleep well, regardless of whether the Tampa Bay Rays got the help they need to keep their playoff hopes alive."I'll find out tomorrow morning," said Maddon, who then was asked if he expected to sleep well. "Absolutely. Like a baby."Bad news awaited the manager when he woke up Tuesday — his team was eliminated from postseason contention.The Rays won for the 11th time in 12 games, beating Baltimore 5-3 on Monday night. That stretch kept them in contention for the AL's second wild-card until Oakland beat Texas 4-3 later Monday night.Baltimore already is assured of being in the playoffs for the first time in 15 years, but still has its sights on outlasting the Yankees for the AL East title. The Orioles fell a game out of first place behind New York when the Yankees beat Boston."We've played 12 playoff games and we've won 11 of them," said Maddon, whose team has outscored opponents 80-31 during the surge. " But we do need help, there's no question about that. Again, regardless, I just love the way our guys are going about their business."Alex Cobb allowed two hits over seven innings, Ben Zobrist hit his 20th homer and Chris Giminez had a two-run double off Wei-Yin Chen as the Rays pulled away from a 1-1 tie in the seventh.Cobb (11-9) yielded a fourth-inning single to J.J. Hardy and an opposite-field solo homer to Matt Wieters that had tied it in the top of the seventh.Chris Davis homered for the fifth straight game for Baltimore, a two-run shot off Kyle Farnsworth that trimmed Baltimore's deficit to 5-3 in the ninth.Fernando Rodney gave up singles to Adam Jones and Wieters to put the potential tying runs on base. The Rays closer struck out Jim Thome and Mark Reynolds before getting Endy Chavez to hit a grounder back to mound to end the game. It was Rodney's 47th save in 49 opportunities."We didn't take care of our business. We lost," Jones said. "When it comes to the Yankees, we can't control them. We can't control if they win or lose."The Orioles arrived in St. Petersburg for the season-ending series later than expected Sunday night after their plane had to divert to Jacksonville because of a fire in the galley.They officially clinched at least a wild-card berth when the Los Angeles Angels lost the second game of a doubleheader to the Texas Rangers late Sunday, and manager Buck Showalter, coaches and players celebrated by having a short meeting and toasting the accomplishment at the team hotel."We've clinched a spot, but we've got an opportunity to win the East. That's big," Jones said before the game. "You get to put up a banner at Camden Yards. It speaks something about the team. It means you finished ahead of the Yankees and Boston and Tampa Bay, everybody."Cobb retired 10 in a row before Hardy singled between shortstop and third base for Baltimore's first hit. The 24-year-old right-hander walked Jim Thome with one out in the fifth and Nate McLouth with one out in the sixth. McLouth stole second, but was stranded when J.J. Hardy grounded to shortstop and Chris Davis took a third called strike.Wieters' career-high 23rd homer home run cleared the short wall in the left-field corner known as 162 Landing, the spot where Evan Longoria hit the 12th-inning homer that the sent the Rays to the playoffs on the final night of last season."It is frustrating when it's out of your hands, but we put ourselves in that position. We could have held our own destiny," Cobb said. "Even coming into the last road trip we had that chance, but we let a couple slip that we wish we could have had back, but we're doing all we can now with what we have."While Maddon is hoping for another dramatic finish, the manager said he won't fret if the Rays fall short of earning their fourth berth in five seasons."Honestly, it just is what it is. We had opportunities early in the year to win more games, and we did not. But so did everybody else," Maddon said."Everybody else is going to be bemoaning the same points if they don't get there at this juncture. So for me, it's about staying right here, keeping the blinders on. It's about moving it forward, organizationally speaking. We've stil got a heartbeat. Let's see what happens. I expect to come out (Tuesday) with another game that means something."NOTES: Chen, who's 0-4 over seven starts since last winning on Aug. 19, hasn't won since Aug. 19, allowed four runs — three of them unearned — and six hits in 6 2-3 innings. ... Zobrist joined B.J. Upton as the only Rays with at least 20 homers. He has driven in 21 runs in 28 games since the start of September. ... Baltimore RHP Jason Hammel (sore right knee) threw five innings in the Florida instructional league and could be available to pitch for the Orioles late this week. ... Orioles RF Nick Markakis (broken left thumb) will have surgically-inserted pins removed in a week.	3	3	4	2	5	5	2	2	2	4	2	3	1	3	3	2
483	real-jersey-boy-frankie-valli-play-broadway-143512599	NEW YORK (AP) — For a short time this fall, Broadway will feature Frankie Valli in two different places.There will be the fake one taking the stage of the August Wilson Theatre for the Tony-winning "Jersey Boys," and the real one appearing for seven nights at the Broadway Theater with The Four Seasons beginning Oct. 19.The 78-year old Valli has been belting iconic hits like "Can't Take My Eyes Off You," and "Sherry" with his trademark falsetto for years. Recently, the New Jersey native spoke to The Associated Press about his career, a stint on "The Sopranos" and where to get the best corned beef sandwich in New York.___AP: What's special about playing Broadway this fall?Valli: I can't think of anybody who had a play on Broadway about their life and appeared on Broadway at the same time, so it was something that I was trying to get happening for a couple years and unable to get anybody to really understand what I was talking about.AP: Since recording technology was far less sophisticated when you started out, how important was it to emotionally deliver the song in the studio?Valli: The first and most important part about having a hit record is something that I learned a long, long time ago. You needed to have a hit song in order to have a hit record. If you didn't have a hit song it didn't matter how great the performance was or the arrangement or the production — you didn't have a hit record. That's just the way it was. It didn't matter if your name was Frank Sinatra or James Brown. It just didn't matter. Every artist has misses. You hopefully go into the studio and do music that your audience is going to like but that does mean they're gonna like everything that you make and sometimes you can run out of ideas.AP: How did The Four Seasons approach it?Valli: I always looked at The Four Seasons as being more of an innovative group for the kind of music that they did. We really never followed what was happening on the radio. We weren't listening to what was happening on the radio. We went in and made music that we loved to do. We had fun doing it. I think when you start to sit down and try to figure out what is it that makes the hit is when you begin to have trouble.AP: What was it about The Four Seasons and that era?Valli: It was a very strange phenomenon because we were a guy's group and girls liked what we did, but in a lot of cases there were groups that guys didn't like because they felt they were being threatened. We were not that. We were saying a lot of things that these street guys wanted to say.AP: When did you realize you wanted to be a recording artist?Valli: I first started out in this business not really wanting to be a pop singer. I was more interested in jazz. That's what I wanted to do. And I remember as a kid, I would sit in the kitchen on the floor — we lived in the projects — with the door open to the outside and I'd listen to "Symphony" Sid, which was on the radio from 12 at night until 6 in the morning. My father would go bananas so I had to keep it so low.AP: What led you to your trademark falsetto vocals?Valli: A lot of groups did. They just used falsetto a little differently than they did. We used it as a lead-in. We used it much stronger. Everybody else used it as background. In a lot of cases we used it as background, too. I sang lead and then when we were making the record I sang a high background part with it.AP: At what point did you know you were onto something?Valli: To be perfectly honest with you, at first when I decided to do pop music I wasn't overly excited, you know? I was trying to do this jazz thing. Jazz wasn't really happening to any great degree. Listening to the radio one day I said, 'Hell, I can do this too.'AP: What would we be surprised to learn that you listen to?Valli: I like country music, I like jazz, and I like blues. (Bob) Dylan is probably one of my all-time favorite, favorite people that there is. Probably America's greatest poet. I've always seen him as that. As (Bruce) Springsteen is the other side of Dylan. Dylan brings out everything that's wrong in the world and Springsteen he finds things that are good.AP: What was it like playing Rusty Millio on the "Sopranos"?Valli: I loved it. It's a part of my life that was really a part of my life, although I was never mobbed up. I grew up in New Jersey. I lived in a neighborhood where there was a presence of organized crime... but all the clubs and bars that everybody worked in were owned by these guys. So I got to know everybody.AP: What did you have for lunch?Valli: We went for a corned beef sandwich on Houston Street — Katz Deli. The secret isn't in not how much meat it is. I don't know if you noticed but they cut it with a knife. It doesn't cut on a machine because it just crumbles. There are no places that do it like that anymore. They undercook it in most places, because they get more sandwiches out of it. You overcook it, and it shrinks. But that's the only way it tastes just right.___Online: http://www.frankievallionbroadway.com___John Carucci covers entertainment for The Associated Press.

484	reality-tv-invisible-front-hollywoods-labor-wars-192926075	LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Reality TV is the invisible front in Hollywood's labor wars.Though reality TV workers once made it as far as the bargaining table, most are as far as ever from winning union representation.Under its former president, the strongly pro-organizing Patric Verrone, the Writers Guild West tried to shine a public spotlight on the sector with its "Reality Rights" campaign.But the issue was knocked out at the finish line in the guild's last contract negotiations with the studios and networks. Meanwhile improved work conditions, a fragmented, freelance work force and pressures of a weak economy have set those efforts back considerably since 2009.WGAW's Director of Communications Neal Sacharow, insists the fight isn't over yet. "We want writers in reality TV who want to organize their production companies or shows to know that the WGAW is ready and available to work with them to get Guild representation," he told TheWrap.But since Verrone was defeated by Christopher Keyser in his bid for re-election last year, the WGAW's efforts have taken on a much lower profile and their tactics have changed dramatically.Other obstacles remain in the path of unionization.Jeff Bartsch has worked as a television editor for years on shows including "America's Next Top Model", "Supernanny" and "Blind Date.""Reality is the Walmart of TV production," he told TheWrap. "Networks pit production companies against each other and bid production budgets down so low that producers often feel that the added cost of union contracts would cost them, and their employees, their jobs."Bartsch remembers taking part in the WGA-sponsored effort in 2009 to organize reality editors and story producers but said that things have changed. He noted that certain reality production companies in Hollywood - once known as the worst offenders in treating their employees - have improved working conditions, making organizing more difficult than it already had been.Then there's the problem of determining what is out there to organize.There is no umbrella group for the production companies. Many production firms are put together for a specific project, the way a TV movie or indie film is. The projects can be one-offs, planned for single season or simply canceled quickly. Neither the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers nor the Motion Picture Association of America maintains overall data on the sector.One of the best indicators of reality's scope comes from FilmLA. The non-profit agency responsible for issuing location permits reports that for the past three years, about 40 percent of the TV permits issued have been for reality projects.In the second quarter of this year, reality TV projects accounted for 1,461 permitted production days. That dwarfed the permitted days for dramas (581), sitcoms (274) and pilots (253).."That's a big part of the problem," said Steve Dayan, the business manager for Teamsters Local 399. "So many of these shows are so small and so transitory that by the time you become aware of them, they're gone.The economy doesn't help, either, particularly here in California where so many productions have left the state."Many of the shows that do stay are extremely low-budget, which is a big part of their appeal to the networks. And there is a sense among producers, and even some cast and crew members, that unionization is not the best business model.Other elements of reality TV production make it a challenge to organize workers.Employees tend to move from one project to another and often switch companies at the same time. And the workers are often young people anxious to gain a foothold in show business and unconcerned with either health or retirement benefits."It's hard to organize in reality because you have so much freelance employment," Lowell Petersen, executive director of the WGA East told TheWrap. "You don't have traditional setups like nurses in the hospital or factory workers on an assembly line. It's project by project."All that said, some strides have been made.The WGA East scored a landmark victory in July, winning company-paid health benefits, paid time off and compensation minimums for roughly 30 reality writer-producers via deals with Lion Television ("Cash Cab") and Optomen Productions ("Worst Cooks in America"). The deals, which took nearly three years and numerous filings with the National Labor Relations Board to achieve, were the guild's first reality pacts in the region. There is less reality production in New York, and it much of it tends toward documentary-type fare, as opposed to on the West Coast.In August, IATSE's Local 700 won company-paid health and retirement benefits for 11 crew members on the Burbank-based Mission Control Media-produced Syfy show "Hot Set" after shutting down production.And IATSE also brought the crew at "Biggest Loser" into the fold after a two-week walkout in 2010. SAG-AFTRA represents the majority of show hosts and regular performers and the Directors Guild of America points to 650 reality directors under contract since 2003.But those triumphs have been hard to come by and relatively rare, and no one disputes that the majority of reality workers remain non-union.The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and International Alliance of Stage Employees have quietly stepped into the vacuum left by the Writer's Guild West. They are favoring a stealthier, bottom-up approach.Dayan of the Teamsters said his union takes a similar tack for the sake of the employees. "They don't want to be seen talking with you because they don't want to be fired," he told TheWrap. "I think of us like the police and fire departments - it takes the citizenry to call first."The unions' motivation isn't entirely altruistic. The difficult economic times and the degree to which the networks have replaced scripted fare with cheaper unscripted shows have taken a toll on some of the unions' dues base and health and pension funds in particular."For us, safety issues are critical." said Dayan, who represents drivers. "There are federal and state laws that apply when you're transporting employees in terms of drug testing and proper rest. We have to convince the employers that using union drivers is not only the safe way and the right thing to do, but it is cost-effective."Dayan remains optimistic, but said he wished that the Teamsters and other unions had been more aggressive when reality TV production began exploding in about 2000."I would absolutely say there is momentum to organize within the reality sector," Dayan said. "Our relationship with the IA has definitely paid off, and we're making inroads. It's slow, but it's sure."	2	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	2	3	3	2	3	3	
485	rebel-wilson-proves-eat-dessert-every-day-hollywood-190626193	LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Playing a character called Fat Amy is probably not the dream of most Hollywood actresses but Australian comedienne Rebel Wilson enjoys breaking the rules - and she's not about to stop eating dessert.After several small but memorable roles in films such as "Bridesmaids" and "Bachelorette," the 27-year-old Wilson looks poised to make it big in the musical film "Pitch Perfect," which opens in U.S. movie theaters on Friday.The film, about an all-girls college singing group competing against male rivals, has an ensemble cast that includes Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow and R&B singer Ester Dean.But it is Wilson who steals the show with wild antics and improvised one-liners as singer Fat Amy, a cardio-averse, over-confident member of acapella group The Bellas.Variety's review said the "picture belongs to Wilson," adding that the actress "fearlessly steps into yet another part that pokes fun at her figure, and happily reveals an outsized singing voice and hilarious dance moves to match."Boxoffice Magazine wrote that Fat Amy "is the role that will turn her into a star," pointing out that Wilson is "hilariously, thrillingly crude" and "could very easily gobble up the film if she weren't such a generous ensemble performer."Wilson has no qualms about making fun of her own figure."In comedy, you've got to use what you've got," Wilson told Reuters. "I'm not a size two, so of course I'm going to use that physicality to my advantage."Weight maybe be a factor in her newfound Hollywood career but she is conscious about staying healthy."You need to have a lot of stamina to do this (job,)" she points out. "I try to be healthy. I train three days a week with a trainer. But I do like to eat, clearly. And I do eat dessert every day. If I cut that out, yes, I would lose weight."At the moment, however, she has no plans to cut anything out and is enjoying breaking down barriers.She recently finished shooting action comedy "Pain and Gain" directed by Michael Bay, a filmmaker known for working with models and directing commercials for Victoria's Secret."Guess what I wear in the movie? Victoria's Secret underwear - that's all I'm dressed in," said Wilson."I know I'm not the physical body type that he usually casts, but for some reason he likes me and thinks I'm funny, so maybe I'm changing his mind," she said of the director.HALLUCINATIONWilson's physical stature was never something she thought would be a factor when it came to her career because she did not set out to be an actress.She graduated from the University of New South Wales with a law degree and was a Rotary International youth ambassador for Australia, stationed in South Africa. While there, she contracted malaria, an event she called "life-changing.""When I was in the hospital in intensive care, I had this hallucination that I was an actress and that I was really, really good, and that I won an Oscar," Wilson recalled.She decided to make a career change. Unable to find acting work or an agent, she wrote and starred in her own play, "The Westie Monologues," which became a huge success in Sydney.That led to professional work on Australian television shows and she eventually came to the United States. Last year's comedy hit "Bridesmaids" - in which she played Kristen Wiig's slacker, diary-reading roommate - put her instantly on the map."That really set the bar high," Wilson admitted. "I got a lot of movies off the back of that."She'll soon be getting more exposure in the TV comedy "Super Fun Night," which was picked up by ABC this month. In yet another sign that she's not just another Hollywood actress, she wrote the script for herself to star in.(Reporting By Zorianna Kit, editing by Jill Serjeant and Claudia Parsons)	3	4	2	3	4	2	2	4	4	1	3	2	4	2	3	
486	reds-clinch-playoff-spot-minus-manager-dusty-baker-214715356--mlb	CHICAGO (AP) — The Cincinnati Reds became the first team in the majors to clinch a playoff spot this season, beating the Chicago Cubs 5-3 Thursday while manager Dusty Baker remained in a hospital after being diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat.Ace Johnny Cueto and the NL Central leaders ensured themselves of at least a wild-card spot. Cincinnati cut its magic number to two for winning the division for the second time in three years.The Reds said Baker would remain in a Chicago hospital for an additional day so doctors could monitor his progress. He left Wrigley Field before Wednesday night's game and underwent another test Thursday.Baker is hoping to return to Cincinnati on Friday. Bench coach Chris Speier ran the team for a second straight game.Cueto (18-9) pitched six shutout innings as the Red completed a three-game sweep.The Reds broke a scoreless tie by getting five straight singles off reliever Manuel Corpas (0-2) in the seventh during a five-run rally capped by Henry Rodriguez's two-run double.Chicago starter Jason Berken allowed just two hits in six innings against a lineup missing most of the Reds' regulars.Cueto gave up five hits with four walks and broke a three-game losing streak.The Cubs scored in the seventh on Anthony Rizzo's RBI single and in the eighth on Welington Castillo's fifth homer again. Rizzo had an RBI grounder in the ninth against Alfredo Simon, who pitched the final 1 1-3 innings for his first save in as many chances.The Reds secured their second playoff appearance in three years despite having the back of their bullpen wiped out by injuries during spring training and losing their best hitter — 2010 National League MVP Joey Votto — for nearly two months.Baker did some of his best managing to pull them through.His first challenge was cobbling together a bullpen after closer Ryan Madson tore an elbow ligament in spring training, ending his season. Setup men Nick Masset and Bill Bray also got hurt before the season opened.Baker eased Aroldis Chapman into the closer's role, and the hard-throwing left-hander set a franchise record with 27 consecutive saves.Baker also had to juggle his batting order and lineup after Votto tore knee cartilage and was sidelined on July 16. The Reds went on their best tear of the season without their top hitter, going 32-16 and taking control of the NL Central.There was some good fortune, too. All five starters have made it through the season without injury, a franchise record. The Reds had to use a sixth starter only because of a doubleheader.By the time September started, the Reds were firmly in control and counting down the days until they'd clinch.NOTES: Cueto's two strikeouts gave him a career-best 159. ... Reds 2B Rodriguez and CF Denis Phipps made their first career starts and SS Didi Gregorius started for just the fourth time. ... The Cubs stay home to play the wild card-contending Cardinals with Chris Carpenter (0-0) set to make his season debut against Chris Volstad (3-10). ... The Reds will start Bronson Arroyo (12-8) at home against the Dodgers' Joe Blanton (9-13) on Friday night. ... Berken, picked up on waivers from Baltimore earlier this month, struck out four batters in one inning — the fifth Cubs pitcher to ever do that — when Ryan Hanigan reached on a third strike wild pitch in the second.___AP Sports Writer Joe Kay contributed to this report.	2	2	4	3	3	3	2	2	2	3	2	3	3	2	2	2

488	remarkable-rookie-colsaerts-saves-europe-shutout-004553957--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - Ryder Cup rookie Nicolas Colsaerts single-handedly saved Europe from being shut out in Friday afternoon's fourballs with a sensational round in what amounted to a duel with Tiger Woods.Colsaerts, the first Belgian to play in the Ryder Cup, got little help from his playing partner Lee Westwood but still carried the team to a one-up win over Woods and Steve Stricker, making eight birdies and an eagle."I've dreamt about this," Colsaerts told reporters. "It's difficult to imagine you're going to do so well. But this is match play. Your focus gets very intense. I just did the best I could."It felt wonderful to be able to produce and deliver on such a big stage with a lot of eyes on you and this unbelievable atmosphere."Westwood said he felt like a spectator with the best seat in the house as he watched his partner roll in a series of monster putts."I didn't really have a lot to do," the Englishman said. "He brought me in to read a putt on 15 and I panicked."I wondered why he was even asking me because everything he looked at went in. I mean, why ruin it now? It was an amazing, amazing round of golf."Colsaerts, the longest driver among the 24 players on the Ryder Cup rosters, was steady off the tee but sizzling hot with his putter, draining half a dozen birdie bombs of 20 feet and longer to hold off Woods.Woods, who also lost his morning foursomes match, posted seven birdies in the afternoon, including five over the last nine as he carried the fight to Colsaerts."Nicolas probably had one of the greatest putting rounds I've ever seen," said Woods, who had a chance to win the 18th and halve the match but grazed the left edge of the cup on his 15-foot birdie putt.Europe assistant captain Paul McGinley said the point earned by Colsaerts was vital for the team after they ended the day 5-3 behind."It was psychologically massive that we won that game and didn't get a whitewash," said McGinley. "All credit to him, it was brilliant."Colsaerts had five birdies on the front nine then an eagle-three at the par-five 10th by draining a five-footer.He added birdies at the 13th and 15th holes to fight off Woods, and then after the world number two stuck his tee shot at the long par-three 17th to four feet, he drained a 25-footer to halve the hole and maintain a one-hole lead.It was a remarkable performance for a player who had fallen so far off form that he lost his European Tour card, then his regular status on the Challenge Tour."When you look back and see where I was three years ago I'm just the perfect example that if you want something really bad and put your work into it, if you've got the heart and the passion, anything is achievable," Colsaerts said this week."It's almost like I feel I've come back from the dead, which is a bit of a weapon. I'm kind of proud of my story," added the Belgian, who won the World Match Play Championship in May, and the China Open last year.Colsaerts comes from a sporting family. His great-grandfather represented Belgium in Olympic basketball and water polo and his father played top-level field hockey.Asked if Woods had said anything to him during the round, the Belgian said: "No, except on 18. When somebody like Tiger Woods looks at you and goes, 'Great playing, man,' you understand you've done something pretty good."(Editing by Julian Linden)	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	3	4	5	3	3	3	2	4	3
489	report-ohio-nurse-didnt-realize-she-took-kidney-215302619	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A nurse who accidentally disposed of a living donor's kidney during a transplant said she didn't realize it was in chilled, protective slush that she removed from an operating room, took down a hall to a dirty utility room and "flushed down a hopper," according to a report released by health officials on Monday.The nurse said she had been on a break when a surgeon told everyone the kidney had been put in the sterile, semi-frozen solution. That detail was in a review by the state for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and obtained by The Associated Press through a records request. The transplant was Aug. 10 at the University of Toledo Medical Center.Hospital administrative staff members interviewed on Aug. 21 hadn't determined how the nurse took the 13-gallon bag of slush, meant to extend the kidney's viability, past several members of the medical staff without them noticing a problem, the report said.It said poor oversight and communication and insufficient policies were factors in the kidney's disposal, which prompted the voluntary, temporary suspension of the hospital's living-donor kidney transplant program and led to reviews by health officials and a consulting surgeon hired by the hospital.The hospital, in northwest Ohio about 135 miles north of Columbus, "failed to provide adequate supervision and communication resulting in a donor's kidney being carried out of the operating room, down a hall, into a dirty utility room, and flushed down a hopper," the report stated.The hospital has since enacted clearer policies to clarify communication between nurses who fill in for one another and to make sure nothing is removed from an operating room until the patient has been moved from it, the report said.The surveyors determined the hospital wasn't in compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, conditions of participation for transplant and surgical services. CMS will authorize a full review of the conditions of participation for the hospital, and, if it's found out of compliance, it could be terminated from the Medicare program, CMS spokeswoman Elizabeth Surgener said in an email.The hospital, which says it offers specialty care in areas including cardiology, cancer, surgery and kidney transplantation, also may submit a plan of correction.A spokesman said he had no comment to provide from the hospital Monday.The hospital hasn't said what happened to the intended kidney recipient, who was supposed to receive an organ donated by her brother. The intended recipient and her brother were released from the hospital, which didn't identify them and said it couldn't say whether she received a different kidney.Hospital officials apologized and hired a Texas surgeon to evaluate their transplant procedures but have not released the results of that evaluation.The medical center suspended two nurses after the incident; one was later fired, and the other resigned, the hospital said. A surgeon was stripped of his title as director of some surgical services, and a surgical services administrator put on paid leave has resumed work.The hospital also notified 975 patients and potential organ donors and recipients that they might need to make other arrangements for services typically provided through the program under review.___Follow Kantele Franko on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/kantele10 .	3	4	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	2	2	1	1	1	3	4
490	republican-study-warns-against-bailout-state-pensions-223332962--sector	(Reuters) - State and local governments facing pension liabilities that already total in the trillions of dollar will be forced to seek bailouts from the U.S. government, Republican Party Congressional staffers said in a study released on Wednesday, as they warned that such bailouts could have dire consequences.Republican staff of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee said with state debt topping $4 trillion, including $2.8 trillion in unfunded pension benefits and at least $627 billion for retiree health care, states may buckle under the pressure to raise taxes, cut spending and take other measures to pay off their debt."Despite the massive federal debt and fiscal imbalances, it will be hard for Washington policy makers to deny sympathetic retired teachers, police and firefighters after a previous Congress bailed out Wall Street and U.S. automakers," the Republican staff commentary said.But it warned that any federal bailout would test the political fabric of the nation, citing the tensions in the European Union over the Greek bailout as a similar situation.In a federal bailout, taxpayers in U.S. states now keeping up with their pension liabilities would be paying for states with the worst-funded public retirement systems, the study said.Because of the difficulties faced in reforming public pension systems -- including union opposition to any reduction in pension and other benefits and the protections provided by law and even by state constitutions -- the study said that a different approach should be taken.It recommended that the U.S. government reduce its potential aid to states in proportion to their unfunded liabilities until their pension funds become solvent over a specific time frame.It also suggested that the ability of states to issue tax-free bonds could be revoked if their pension funds are expected to go broke within 10 years."As undesirable as a federal bailout of state pensions is, setting forth the terms and conditions of a potential bailout may be exactly what is needed to prevent one from happening," the study said. "If the states understand how severe the terms of a federal bailout would be, they are more likely to take action now to fix their unsustainable pensions."(Editing by Peter Bohan)	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	3	3	3	3	2	1	2	3	4
491	review-3-d-makes-beautifully-bleak-dredd-pop-032558453	A wickedly dark comic streak breaks up the vivid violence and relentless bleakness of "Dredd 3D."The action extravaganza from director Pete Travis and writer Alex Garland, based on the cult-favorite British comic series "2000 A.D.," offers a fully realized world with both intensity and tension. But after about an hour the claustrophobia of it all — the dreary, concrete sameness and the overpowering electronic score — feels smothering and grows tiresome. Maybe that's the point, though: to wear us down.The visceral visuals, shot in 3-D by Oscar-winning "Slumdog Millionaire" cinematographer and frequent Lars Von Trier collaborator Anthony Dod Mantle, feature extreme close-ups and sequences of super-cool slow-motion photography, which wisely are spread sparingly throughout the course of the picture. A guy doesn't just get shot in the face — we see the bullet enter his mouth and send blood spurting out his cheek through the screen in such deliberate, distinct fashion, you can practically count the drops.Karl Urban stars as the stoic Judge Dredd, the baddest bad-ass of them all in a dystopian future where enforcers like him serve as judge, jury and executioner, right on the spot. Dredd is the most fearsome of the judges in the squalid, densely populated Mega City One, with his ever-present helmet and a low, monotone grumble that recalls both Christian Bale's Batman and Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name. He acts entirely with his mouth and his sheer intimidating presence. He gets no poignant origin story.(For the uninitiated, Dredd is actually much funnier than this description makes him sound; his terse, deadpan responses to the most absurdly graphic and depraved situations provoke many of the biggest laughs.)Olivia Thirlby, best known for indies and comedies like "Juno," has a calm yet confident presence as the rookie Judge Anderson, who happens to have been assigned to Dredd for training upon one particularly bloody day. Her psychic abilities make her an asset when things get especially chaotic, and her slightly ethereal nature provides a welcome complement to Dredd's intense groundedness. She also serves as our emotional guide to a world that's essentially emotionless, aside from fear.Dredd and Anderson respond to a gory triple homicide at the Peach Trees housing complex, a 200-story ghetto tower ruled from on high by the ruthless prostitute-turned-drug-lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey, her beautiful features disfigured by a severe facial scar). When the judges take one of her lieutenants into custody as a suspect (Wood Harris, best known as Avon Barksdale from "The Wire"), Ma-Ma puts the whole place on lockdown and insists she'll keep it that way until someone shoots the judges dead.Many of the residents are happy to do her bidding because a) they're deathly afraid of her and b) she's got them hooked on a powerful drug called Slo-Mo, which reduces the sensation of reality to 1 percent of its usual speed. These moments make "Dredd 3D" stand out visually from so many other movies, whether they're action flicks or drug films. Oversaturated and finely detailed, the Slo-Mo sequences are mesmerizing for their richly colored and radiantly sparkling beauty — and again, Travis doesn't overdo them, which is key.Hardcore fans of the comic who hated the jokey 1995 "Judge Dredd," starring Sylvester Stallone as the title character and featuring Rob Schneider, won't just be relieved to see this incarnation. They'll be downright giddy."Dredd 3D," a Lionsgate release, is rated R for strong bloody violence, language, drug use and some sexual content. Running time: 98 minutes. Three stars out of four.___Motion Picture Association of America rating definition for R: Restricted. Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	3	3	4	2	3	1	4	4
492	review-great-cast-saves-enemy-people-010145601	NEW YORK (AP) — You almost have to admire the devilishly intricate dilemma Henrik Ibsen creates for his hero in "An Enemy of the People." It's diabolical.Minute by minute, the pressure piles on the shoulders of Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a rather vain scientist who has discovered that the spa town of his birth is built on toxic water. Yet this well-intentioned whistleblower is put in an untenable spot, and eventually branded an enemy of the people.A fine Manhattan Theatre Club's production that opened Thursday at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre starts shakily but ends as a full-throated defense of the individual.Boyd Gaines and Richard Thomas are marvelous as the battling brothers at the heart of the play, but there are terrific turns also by Gerry Bamman, Michael Siberry and Kathleen McNenny. Director Doug Hughes paces it like a thriller, with the heat rising steadily.In his egotistical and naive way, Stockmann expects a parade in his honor when he finds proof that the baths in his 19th century Norwegian town are a health threat. But the town depends on the tourists who flock to the baths and the mayor, who happens to be Stockmann's brother, is nonplussed by the science. Or is it sibling rivalry?At first, Stockmann gets the support of the press — represented by journalist Hovstad (a complicated John Procaccino) — and the mainstream townsfolk — represented by a prominent citizen and printer Aslaksen (Bamman). They want to use the issue to attack the town leaders. But that plan disappears as soon as the mayor points out the economic disaster that closing the baths would entail. Public opinion, so fickle, has shifted, but Stockmann can't back down or compromise."I want to be able to look my sons in the eye when they grow up into free men," he says.Watching the pendulum swing from Stockmann in control to his brother getting the upper hand is a pleasure, with four-time Tony Award winner Gaines becoming increasingly despondent and wild, while Thomas plays his character with gleeful unctuousness.McNenny, as Stockmann's wife (and Gaines' real-life wife), is fierce in a part that burns bright but for too short a time. Her character both appreciates her husband's sense of honor but also sees the disaster his lost income and exile would bring."I have truth and honor on my side," says Stockmann."What good are they when you have no power?" she replies. But save for a few strong scenes, Ibsen puts Mrs. Stockman on the sidelines — a shame.By now the townspeople have become a mob and that has given Hughes an opportunity to make his staging spill into the audience. For Stockmann's courtroom-like defense of the exceptional individual over the ordinary throng, Hughes has gotten five actors to occupy the theater's first row and cheer and boo. One is drunk. Democracy, Ibsen is saying, is a foul-mouthed mob.The web of pressure relentlessly closes on Stockmann. His father-in-law, who may be responsible for the toxins, gives him an ultimatum that affects his family's financial health, and the townsfolk approach the doctor again with a scheme to make money if he will only retract his findings. His brother never relents: Blood, of course, proves less thick than sludge.No matter, says Stockman, who keeps his sense of humor even as he fights to keep honest."They tore my best trousers," he says. "The first lesson of freedom fighting, never wear your favorite trousers when you go out to fight for truth and justice."The production benefits from John Lee Beatty's spare, unfussy sets and Catherine Zuber's striking costumes, particularly the black leather trench worn by Hovstad. The palette here is plenty of grays, darks and muted colors — perfect for a grim look at morality.Other than the acting, there's little subtlety in this play, which often feels more like a lecture. Environmentalists will find a warning about global warming and libertarians may pull out an articulate defense of individualism.But theater-goers without a political agenda get to watch a bunch of actors at the top of their game. "The strongest man," says Stockmann at the rather overwrought conclusion. "He's always alone." Not to be rude, but this great cast proves the opposite.___Online:http://www.manhattantheatreclub.com	2	3	2	2	2	3	1	3	3	4	2	4	3	1	3	3
493	review-tv-guide-app-impressive-could-more-183451308--finance	NEW YORK (AP) — I grew up in a TV Guide household. I'd flip through the magazine each week to see what was on. Keeping track of what to watch was pretty simple with only three main networks and a new one called Fox. Cable channels showed mostly reruns and old movies.There are a gazillion channels these days, including basic and premium cable channels with decent original series. Add to that all the content available through streaming, downloads and DVDs, and it can be challenging not to miss your favorite shows. TV Guide's printed edition doesn't bother with full listings anymore.That's where the new TV Guide app comes in. Available for free for iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices, the app gives you a clean display of what's on TV over the next two weeks. An Android version is coming this fall.You can view listings by time or channel or search for specific shows. You can create a Watchlist of your favorite shows, movies, actors and sports teams and see what's available on demand now or on television later.The new app is more comprehensive than the guide on a digital-video recorder because it includes shows available on such services as Hulu, iTunes and Netflix, plus on-demand offerings through Xfinity for Comcast subscribers.But it could be much more.You start by creating an account and picking your television provider from a list. The listings are then customized according to what's available on your cable or satellite lineup (there's an "antenna" option on the list, too). You can choose to display all channels, or create a list of favorites containing channels you watch most often.You then start browsing the listings. If you see that "SpongeBob SquarePants" is on at 5 p.m. on Channel 6, you can set a reminder for the iPad (or iPhone) to notify you five, 10, 30 or 60 minutes before the show starts. You can have the iPad do that for all episodes or just new ones —or just that particular showing. By hitting "I'll Watch," you can make that known on a social network such as Facebook or Twitter.Or you can add the show to your Watchlist.The Watchlist is the best part of the new app. I can set it up for quick access to Mets games listings or anything on television starring Natalie Portman.That's also where you can find out whether any of your favorites are available on DVD through Netflix. It doesn't tell you about online streaming choices on Netflix (that's coming), but it does for Hulu, HBO, Cinemax, the CW, ABC, ABC Family and Sony's online streaming service, Crackle. Others are expected soon. The Watchlist also shows the episodes you can buy and download from Apple's iTunes store.On my Watchlist, I saw that a handful of "Revenge" episodes were available for free on ABC. Clicking on one took me right to ABC's app for viewing.Through another tab, called New Tonight, you can see which of your favorites are on television that night. You can see what's popular based on how many users have clicked "I'll Watch." With that feature, I learned of a show about a food truck competition on the Food Network.Beyond that, the app has news, photos and video on television and celebrities. There were also special features, such as the fall television schedule at a glance and the Emmy nominees in key categories.Unfortunately, the app was stingy when it came to giving me information on shows. I clicked on "666 Park Avenue," hoping to get a description of the new ABC show. All I got was an option to add it to my Watchlist.And that show about the food trucks? I had to go to the TV Guide website on a computer to find out more.As for the main listings, clicking on any program gets you a brief description, the kind you get in newspaper television guides or old printed editions of TV Guide magazine. You can add it to your Watchlist, request an alert or post it on a social network. That's it.One feature TV Guide might consider adding: The ability to click on a link to get all the other episodes of that show, including those on streaming or DVDs, as well as the other times that particular episode would be repeated on TV. I'd also like to see a list of each show's key actors in the episode description, along with links to find out what other shows they appear in over the next two weeks.Those features are available on TV Guide's website, but not on the app.TV Guide plans to add some of these features to its app at some point. To get it ready for the fall TV season, TV Guide says it had to focus on the features most requested, the ones most used on its website and those that might help it sell ads.The TV Guide app beats checking static listings in a newspaper or the TV Guide Network on television. In many respects, it also beats the TV Guide website, as it doesn't force me to get off my couch to find out what's on. I can have the iPad right there, next to my remote control.But it needs more to work as a personalized television guide.The New Tonight section comes closest to offering that, but shows I said "I'll Watch" don't appear there, unless I've added them to my Watchlist as well. Same goes for shows I've requested alerts for. It's also limited to a few hours that night — not during the day, not the next night, not next weekend. There also isn't a way to check off episodes I'd already watched, either on television or through streaming.The TV Guide app is worth checking out, particularly for the way it brings together all aspects of television — the traditional channels, online streaming and episodes on DVDs. It can certainly help to organize your television life. Just don't expect it to take control quite yet.___Anick Jesdanun, deputy technology and media editor for The Associated Press, can be reached at njesdanun(at)ap.org.	4	3	3	4	4	3	2	3	2	2	3	3	2	2	3	4
494	rg3-leads-last-minute-drive-beat-bucs-24-000906154--spt	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Billy Cundiff redeemed himself for a poor day kicking, booting a 41-yard field goal with 3 seconds remaining to give the Washington Redskins a 24-22 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.Cundiff missed three earlier attempts, including a 31-yarder that wound have put the Redskins (2-2) up by two scores early in the fourth quarter. He also missed twice in the first half, but was on the money after Robert Griffin III marched his team into position for the winning score.Tampa Bay (1-3) wiped out an 18-point deficit to go ahead 22-21 on Connor Barth's third field goal, a 47-yarder with 1:42 remaining.But Griffin wasn't finished. He completed three straight passes to move the Redskins from their own 20 to the 41, then ran for 15 yards to the 26. Two plays, Cundiff kicked the winner.	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	2	1	3	4

Lincoln Chafee hailed the state's investment, which he says will lead to expanded operations at Providence's port. He says the cranes will help increase container ship activity and create more jobs at the city's waterfront.The Port of Providence is managed by ProvPort, a nonprofit public-private partnership. In 2008, cargo at the waterfront exceeded 3.1 million tons, making Providence's port the second busiest in New England after Boston.	2	2	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	1	1	1	2	4

The judge said Taylor had broken a local law that prohibits residents from letting their pets habitually howl, bark or make other noise.Taylor's lawyer says the ordinance is unconstitutional because it gives no parameters for what noise constitutes a violation. He notes the statute says that if someone is annoyed, it's a public nuisance.A neighbor accused Taylor's bird of parroting vulgar phrases, cursing and loudly speaking expletives.

498	richard-gere-why-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-165401111	(First, fourth, and fifth answers contain profanity)LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - "Arbitrage," Nicholas Jarecki's indie drama about a high-powered New York hedge fund mogul (Richard Gere) enduring self-inflicted calamities on both personal and professional levels, opened on Friday and racked up exceptionally good business over its first three days. It grossed more than $2 million on fewer than 200 screens, the best-ever showing for a film that opened in theaters day-and-date with VOD.One of the screenings that didn't go on the ledger took place at the Academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills on Saturday night, where the film played to a nearly full house and reportedly won a strong reaction from the Oscar voters in attendance.Gere has never been nominated for an Oscar despite a 37-year career in film, and he's facing an uphill battle this year in a very crowded Best Actor category. But he's sly and quietly commanding as a wealthy trader whose world is on the verge of collapsing as a risky business deal goes bad and a midnight drive with his mistress turns deadly.You don't work very often. Why did you do this film?It's just a beautifully written script, beautifully structured. And it deals with a world that we all want to know more about. It's so relevant to our happiness, what those fuckers are doing.And I liked the moral ambiguity of all of the characters, especially the character that I'm playing. The gradations of self-awareness, the empathy or lack of it.We're conditioned to want to like the main character in a movie, but in the first few minutes "Arbitrage" gives us a laundry list of reasons why we shouldn't like this guy. Was it a challenge as an actor to keep us invested in him despite that?I could have made the choice to play this character as more of a Bernie Madoff, or even darker. I mean, a real villain. But that wasn't interesting to me, or to Nick. It was too easy, and if I did that I don't think you'd be invested in him, as you say. Although you don't like what the guy does, you've gotta take the trip with him.It's like with Bill Clinton. You know he's got problems, but he's our Clinton. It's like, "He's so lovable, he's so smart, he's cute, he's boyish ... " It was more important for me to get all the cylinders working on that part, as well as the machinations of what a Machiavellian guy in the financial world is capable of.So Madoff and Clinton were the touchstones?At the time we made this, Madoff was the elephant in the room. Since then, some characters have emerged who are more like this guy. Jamie Dimon is much more like this character than Madoff - he's a reputable, charming guy who just lost $9 billion of someone else's money.And Ted Kennedy. Chappaquiddick. I thought, Wow, this is a really potent combination: power with flaws, big ideas. Really Shakespeare-sized stuff here.A Shakespearean tragic hero, though, would end up dead. Your guy meets a much more ambiguous fate.There was a certain faction, including the director, that thought this guy was fucked. We had arguments about that. They said, "His wife owns him, and that's it - she's gonna leave him and take everything." I said, "No fucking way." Look at where Clinton is today. That's the route he's gonna take: He's gonna rope-a-dope for a while. He's gonna take the punches and do his mea culpas.Look, none of these people want to change their lives. is a woman totally invested in this guy and his world, and she loves him. Look at Hillary Clinton. She could have taken a totally different route, but I think she went with her heart. She said, "I love the guy, I know he messed up, but he's my Bill." And I think Susan's character will ultimately do the same thing.The character has a sense of invulnerability, as do a lot of people in that position. There's a feeling that things can be screwed up, but there's a way out of this.Absolutely. They're very confident: "I can make this work and I'm not going to lose." I spent time with those guys, and that's very much the mentality I wanted to feel on a visceral level. I see that with politicians, too.I remember that I used to do this real cowboy stuff in Nevada. We would move horses from the north pasture, the summer pasture, to the winter pasture and back again. It'd be 10 days, and you'd be out there moving 150 horses. A lot of fun. But you hoped for that moment when one horse would take off, you know? We were all good at what we did, keeping the horses in line and moving along, but we were so happy when one horse said "fuck it" and ran. Because everyone could get crazy then: "Let's go get 'em, boys!"I think that's part of the mentality. You never put it on the resume that you had a problem, but it gets your blood up.How big a concern was it that the director had never directed before?Huge. But he knows this world, and he wrote that script, so I knew that he can tell stories. You make a bet.Did his inexperience show during the shoot?Sure. He didn't know exactly where to put the camera, he didn't know what lens, but he hired really good people who know how to do that. He didn't know how to talk to actors, because he'd never been through it before. And he couldn't really demonstrate to them, because he's not a good actor.But he was good at keeping his energy up, and the stress level never buried him. It buries a lot of people.Do you assume a slightly different role in a case like this? Slightly. I'm always involved anyhow, but here I was translating to actors what he wanted. I could help him say things in a way that would communicate to an actor, and not obfuscate. It's easy to confuse someone - an actor especially. So sometimes I was just the interpreter, saying, "This is what he means" in the native language.You've talked about the tie between your character and politicians. What are your thoughts on the current campaign? I'm very happy that Obama's ahead. I'm pleased by that, and I will be voting for him, without a doubt.Will you be campaigning or speaking out?I don't think there's any need. It's not for me, it's for the president to tell the American people what he's going to do, and explain to them in a way that they'll feel it.	4	5	4	4	4	3	2	4	4	2	4	3	3	3	4	
499	rick-perrys-campaign-imploded-4-revelations-133900010--election	Some political gaffes are so bad, so disqualifying, that they act like the "political equivalent of antibiotic-resistant bacteria" and simply kill a campaign, says Jay Root, a reporter for The Texas Tribune and author of the new e-book Oops! A Diary From the 2012 Campaign Trail. That's exactly the kind of blunder that Texas Gov. Rick Perry, once considered the frontrunner for the GOP nomination, committed on Nov. 9, 2011, when, during a primary debate, he tried to recall the three cabinet departments he would eliminate if he became president. "I would do away with the Education, the, uh, Commerce, and, let's see," Perry said, in the campaign's most agonizing 53 seconds. "I can't. The third one I can't. Sorry. Oops." That last word became the epitaph for Perry's doomed bid. How did it happen? Here, four revelations from the vantage point of a reporter covering Perry's campaign:1. Perry got no sleep the night before his "oops"Root reveals that during the debate debacles, Perry "was just very sleepy," says Taylor Berman at Gawker. The candidate, who had undergone back surgery in July 2011, had painful sensations in his leg and foot that were keeping him up at night. As Root puts it, after the surgery sidelined him, he went from being a light sleeper to being an insomniac, and it showed. The morning before one debate the governor told his travel aide: "I didn't sleep a wink." A Florida GOP official who met the candidate during one commercial break told reporters she could tell he was in physical distress: "His hand was so cold, like ice. And he was sweating. I don't know what it was, but something was definitely wrong."SEE MORE: The media's obsession with political gaffes: 4 downsides2. Everyone was shocked by his disastrous debatesDuring one debate, Perry gave "a rambling, incoherent attack" in which he tried to accuse Mitt Romney of being a flip-flopper, says Connor Simpson at The Atlantic. Root says an ABC News reporter, Arlette Saenz, turned to him and asked, "Was he like this in Texas?" Root, often called on to provide similar perspective, was at a loss. "Honey, we're in uncharted waters," he told Saenz. "Behind the scenes, Perry's team was just as confused as anyone. Their guy was awful, and they knew it."3. The belated diagnosis for Perry's fog: Sleep apneaArmchair medical experts chalked up Perry's mental lapses to painkillers prescribed after his back surgery, say Ashley Killough and Kevin Bohn at CNN, but the campaign maintained he had stopped taking them. Advisers called in sleep specialists, who diagnosed sleep apnea, Root says, a disorder affecting one in 10 men, causing "loud snoring and temporary lapses in breathing that disrupt normal sleep." Perry's doctors prescribed a breathing machine that pushes a constant flow of air through the breathing passages, which helped. "Perry, an exercise junkie, soon got back to normal once he was able to work out again." By then it was too late, Root says. "The narrative had already been set. He was becoming an afterthought."SEE MORE: The battle over voter ID laws4. Perry was going down in flames — even without "oops"One thing Root's account makes clear, says Joe Holley at the Houston Chronicle, is that "even if Perry had slept like a baby for eight hours a night," he didn't stand a chance of acing a brutal, unforgiving presidential campaign. The "multitudinous gaffes" were just the tip of the iceberg. There was also "infighting and feuding at the top and the candidate's woeful ill-preparedness." Those factors alone "would have been enough to doom the campaign." The historically memorable "oops" moment "was merely the coup de grace."Read more political coverage at The Week's 2012 Election Center.SEE MORE: Ted Cruz's Texas Senate primary victory: 4 takeawaysView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	3	2	1	2	3	4

503	rioting-erupts-thousands-turn-dutch-town-party-promoted-135753942	AMSTERDAM - Thousands of revelers descended on a small Dutch town sparking a riot after a party invitation posted on Facebook went viral, authorities said Saturday.Prosecutor Hessel Schuth said 34 people were arrested were arrested Friday night and in the early hours of Saturday morning and would be prosecuted for public order offences. Several people were injured, but none were believed to be seriously hurt."Scum ran amok in our town," said Rob Bats, mayor of Haren, 185 kilometres (115 miles) north of Amsterdam."An innocent invitation on Facebook for a party led to serious rioting, destruction, plundering, arson and injuries in the middle of Haren," he said.Bats said an initial analysis showed a core group of rioters "were very violent and well-prepared and deliberately sought confrontation" with hundreds of police who had been dispatched to the town amid fears of trouble.Dutch media reported that the party originally was planned as a small celebration by a 16-year-old girl but her invitation went viral when she posted it on Facebook.Some of the people arriving in Haren on Friday wore T-shirts emblazoned with "Project X Haren," a reference to the film "Project X" that portrayed an out-of-control party.On Saturday, another Facebook group sprang up called Project Clean-X Haren, urging people to help clear up the debris littering the town's streets.	2	4	4	3	3	2	2	2	2	3	2	2	1	3	2	4

505	romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election	Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax return and posted it online Friday, triggering a mad media dash to see what was inside. (See the first page of the return below.) Romney and his wife, Ann, paid $1.95 million in taxes on investment income of $13.7 million last year (a significant dip from his 2010 haul of $20 million). The GOP presidential nominee made his fortune running private equity firm Bain Capital from 1984 to 1999 (or 2001, depending on whom you ask), so his earnings now come from money he has invested. That means he paid a lower tax rate — 14.1 percent — than workers pay on ordinary income from a paycheck. What do the revelations say about Romney and his run for the presidency? Here, four key takeaways:1. Romney paid too much... busted!The "gotcha moment" here, says Derek Thompson at The Atlantic, is the revelation that Romney only deducted $2.25 million of his $4 million in charitable donations, or less than he was entitled to. Why would he do that? Because he'd sworn up and down that he never paid less than 13 percent of his income in taxes over the last decade, and if he had deducted every penny he was entitled to last year, he would have had an effective tax rate under 10 percent. Pretty lame, as bombshells go, but liberals are chiding Mitt because he said he always pays what the law requires — no more, no less — and "if I had paid more [taxes] than are legally due I don't think I'd be qualified to become president." Ha! He paid too much but he said he didn't! "Yeah, yeah. Gotcha. Whatever."SEE MORE: Is Mitt Romney against a two-state solution in Israel?2. This was as good a time as any to tear off the Band-AidMitt has been promising to hand over his 2011 forms for some time, says Chris Cillizza at The Washington Post, so why now? For one thing, it's Friday, and it's a Washington tradition to dump news on topics you want hushed up when everyone's thinking about the coming weekend. More importantly, Romney's '47 percent' secret-video comments already made him the loser on "the big political scoreboard" this week, and "political strategy 101 dictates that when things are going badly is the best time to dump other bad." Besides, the first presidential debate is just two weeks away, and the longer he waited the more likely the returns were to become a big topic in his showdown with President Obama. Now he can move on, and work on turning everyone's attention back to the economy and Obama's handling of it.3. Romney told the truth; Harry Reid didn'tThroughout the summer-long push to get Romney to release years and years of tax returns, says Michelle Malkin at her blog, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) "claimed that a number of people had told him that Mitt Romney didn’t pay any taxes for a decade." Perhaps Harry and his imaginary friends would like to apologize now? Not only did Romney's trustee, Brad Malt, confirm that the former Massachusetts governor paid taxes every year for the past two decades, says Daniel Halper at The Weekly Standard, but his average tax rate was roughly 20 percent — which is what the Obamas paid last year. Sorry, folks, no scandal here.SEE MORE: Mitt Romney's 5 toughest Republican critics4. Congress and the IRS should be embarrassed, not RomneyThe only thing the 200-page tax return proves about him is that he is "a very wealthy man," which is neither surprising nor shameful, says Peter Suderman at Reason. The people who should be red-faced here are the ones responsible for the "needlessly complex" tax code that forces people to construct documents as thick as a phone book every time Uncle Sam demands his pound — or, in Romney's case, ton — of flesh. Maybe instead of wasting time prying into Romney's personal tax history, which isn't really that important, we should be hounding him to release "the details of his plan to reform the U.S. tax code, which he has so far refused to specify."SEE MORE: Mitt Romney's '47 percent disaster': A campaign killer?Read more political coverage at The Week's 2012 Election Center.SEE MORE: Mitt Romney's '47 percent disaster': Is it actually a golden opportunity?View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	2	3	2	3	2	3	2	3	3	3	3	3	1	2	3	3
506	romney-says-obama-trying-fool-voters-inaccurate-attacks-013006702--abc-news-politics	DENVER - Mitt Romney today accused President Obama of "trying to fool" voters into thinking Romney believes in things he does not, telling reporters aboard his campaign plane that Obama is running on talking points he knows are "wrong.""The president will not be able to continue to mischaracterize my pathway," said Romney, in answering a question about the importance of the upcoming debates. "I'll continue to describe mine, he will describe his, and people will make a choice. That's the great thing about democracy."I'm not going to try to fool people into thinking he believes things he doesn't," Romney said. "He's trying to fool people into thinking that I think things that I don't. And that ends at the debates."Romney's press conference came after a rough week for the candidate, and is the first sign of an attempt by the candidate to turn around the campaign, which is set to make stops in the battleground states of Colorado, Ohio and Virginia before the week's end.Asked by ABC News which issues he specifically thinks the President is trying to "fool" voters about or which particularly get to him, Romney rattled off a list: the auto maker bailout, taxes and social issues."They're not that they particularly get to me, but I think that they're inaccurate," said Romney.Romney said "nothing could be further from the truth" when Obama says he supported liquidating the auto industry."My plan was to rebuild the auto industry and take it through bankruptcy so that could happen, and by the way he doesn't mention he took them through bankruptcy," Romney said.Romney said Obama accuses him of being in favor of lowering taxes on wealthy people."No I'm not," Romney said. "I'm not going to reduce the taxes on the wealthy at all, in fact I want to lower taxes on middle income people. He says I want to raise them on middle income people - that's completely inaccurate."And on abortion, Obama's wrong on that, too, Romney said."He says I'm opposed to abortion even in cases of rape and incest," Romney said. "That's wrong."One ad after another of his ad statements has been determined to be factually inaccurate," Romney said. "And you know I understand that politics is politics but in the past, when you've had an ad which has been roundly pointed out to be wrong you take it out and you correct it and put something back on. He keeps running these things even though he knows they're wrong and saying them in rallies, even though he knows they're wrong."When asked if he doesn't think it's vital for him to "win" the first debate, which is just over a week away, Romney declined to get into the stakes of the debates."I don't expect this to be a contest of who can say the cutest phrase, I think it's a contest of very different directions for the country," he answered.The Obama campaign in a statement following Romney's remarks said that it's "odd" Romney "won't take personal responsibility for his campaign's troubles," adding that it takes "a lot of chutzpah" to "shed crocodile tears over a legitimate discussion of his record and policies.""Here are the facts: if Mitt Romney had had his way and we'd let Detroit go bankrupt, GM and Chrysler would no longer be in business today. He would raise taxes on middle class families to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires," said Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith. "And he endorsed the Republican Party platform that would ban abortion even in the cases of rape and incest. If he's so offended by his own positions, maybe he shouldn't have taken them in the first place."	4	3	4	3	3	4	2	3	3	2	3	4	1	3	3	3
507	romneys-fumbles-220011891	Let me begin with a prediction: Mitt Romney will be the next president of the United States.Why? Because I cannot believe the people of the United States will re-elect a sitting president who has spent so much of their money to achieve so little visible result.But polls are showing it's close, very close, and that Romney starts the fourth quarter slightly behind or dead even with a failed president.The conventional wisdom is that social issues are the problem for the GOP coalition, but the truth is the conservative movement's bigger problem is that Americans are not nearly as libertarian as our party elites. Hence, the poor analyses of the political problems Romney faces.What are Romney's fumbles?The first was his convention speech. Romney's is the first speech in the history of conventions that mustered approval of less than half of Americans, according to Gallup. Just 38 percent called Romney's speech "good" or "excellent"; 10 percent said it was terrible. The rest were simply unmoved, apparently.Why didn't Americans like the speech? Too much bio-fluff, too much blame -- and too little coherent case for how electing Romney president will get the economy moving.When the most memorable line from a convention speech involves the daily red rose your long-dead mom received from your even-longer-dead dad, you've fumbled it.The second Romney fumble was his blatantly hair-trigger political reaction to the murder of an American ambassador in Libya. Romney managed to make the first words out of his mouth as the jihadists attacked and killed a U.S. ambassador a criticism of the president of the United States.Memo to Romney campaign: In the middle of a firefight, Americans want our ammo aimed at the actual enemy, not a circular firefight.He should have said, "My message to these immoral killers is: Americans stand as one against your futile and ugly hate," and left the critique of foreign policy until after the ambassador's body was buried.Romney's third fumble was the Romney campaign's decision to defend his stray comment about the "47 percent" -- to own it, to make it a campaign theme on the grounds it is technically "true."Memo to Romney campaign: Old people who've worked hard and paid taxes all their lives do not like being lumped with welfare moms as "moochers."By doing so, Team Romney exacerbated what appears to be a growing liability on the Medicare issue. In a New York Times/CBS poll, more than 75 percent of voters favor keeping Medicare the way it is.A Times poll in the swing states of Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin found that about six in 10 voters say keep Medicare the way it is, and three-quarters of the likely voters in each of these states said Medicare is worth what it costs taxpayers. The Washington Post reports that in the key swing state of Virginia, Obama has opened up a commanding 13-point lead among likely voters on the question of who they "trust to do a better job determining the future of the Medicare program."We've learned in the last few weeks what we already knew: Romney is a weak candidate. But it's not Romney alone: Conservative elites appear unaware of how thin the ice is around making Medicare "reform" a top issue.Older voters are the fastest-growing demographic in America. They are natural GOP voters for traditional values -- unless you appear inordinately eager to reform the most popular social program in America.If Romney doesn't rise to the top of his game, he may not be president.It's the fourth quarter, but Romney's fumbles are keeping the game close.Only it's not a game. The future of the United States of America is at stake.(Maggie Gallagher is the founder of the National Organization for Marriage and has been a syndicated columnist for 15 years.)	4	4	3	3	4	2	1	4	3	1	3	4	1	2	4	4
508	romneys-ties-netanyahu-politics-iran-133422281--politics	Welcome to the Political Landscape, a weekly podcast where we discuss the news of the day with leading experts and analysts.Recently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared on American TV to state his belief that Iran is six months away from nuclear weapons capability. Many saw the comments as a strategic attempt during the U.S. presidential election to pressure either President Obama or Mitt Romney into committing to military action against Iran. Currently, the U.S. is focusing on economic sanctions against Iran.National Journal senior correspondent James Kitfield has written on national security and foreign for more than two decades. He’ll join me to discuss comments made by Romney that revealed just how aligned the presidential candidate is with Netanyahu. In this week’s magazine, Kitfield writes about Romney’s hard line stance on Iran and disavowal of a two-state solution with Israel. This position, Kitfield says, breaks with all presidents of recent history, Democrat or Republican.Then we’ll speak with Barbara Slavin, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and Washington correspondent for Al-Monitor.com, a new website devoted to news from and about the Middle East. Slavin recently returned from Tehran, the capital of Iran, where she saw the impact of U.S. economic sanctions and the state of the Iranian nuclear program.Check out last week's episode about deceptive super PACs.Check out all past episodes of the Political Landscape.	3	2	2	2	2	1	2	3	2	1	3	2	1	2	3	4
509	rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362	NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Harry's still finished, but don't rule out any return to the Potter world.Although J.K. Rowling's first novel tailored for adults is being released this week, she says her next book will likely be a children's book, and in the future she may pen a story related to the Harry Potter universe."I think it very likely that the next thing I publish will be for kids. I have a children's book that I really like, it's for slightly younger children than the Potter books," Rowling told the BBC in a television interview broadcast on Wednesday.In one of a handful of appearances to promote "The Casual Vacancy," which hits bookstores worldwide on Thursday, Rowling told the BBC: "Truly, where Harry's story is concerned, I'm done.Yet the 47-year-old best-selling British author did not rule out a Potter spin-off, while she was adamant it would never be for commercial reasons. The seven "Harry Potter" books have sold more than 450 million books worldwide."I have always left the door ajar because I'm not that cruel. If I had a fabulous idea that came out of that world, because I loved writing it, I would do it," she told the BBC."But I've got to have a great idea, I don't want to go mechanically into that world and pick up odds and ends and glue them together and say 'Here we go, we can sell this'. It would make a mockery of what those books were to me."Were that great idea to come, she said: "I probably would do it. I'm very averse to the prequel/sequel idea. I've never seen it work well in either literature or film. That's a personal preference."Rowling, who started her writing career as a financially struggling, single mother, said while there was clearly "an appetite for eight, nine, ten," Potter novels, she knew she only had enough plot for seven books about Harry's magical adventures."To go further would have been money for old rope. Couldn't do it. And that's largely why I slapped on that epilogue (in the final "Harry Potter" novel). (It) says he's leading a quiet life, and he's earned it. He's done," she said of the boy wizard.POTTER DIRECTOR'S CUT, TEEN OCDRowling said she would have liked more time to work on some of the books."I had to write on the run and there were times when it was really tough. And I read them, and I think 'Oh God, maybe I'll go back and do a director's cut". I don't know," she said in BBC interview."But you know what?" she added. "I'm proud I was writing under the conditions under which I was writing. No one will ever know how tough it was at times."In a separate interview with ABC's "Nightline", Rowling revealed that she had signs of obsessive-compulsive behavior when she was a teenager, and that one of the characters in "The Casual Vacancy" was drawn from her own experiences."These are things I know from the inside," she said in the interview, some of which was aired on "Good Morning America" on Wednesday. "When I was in my teens, I had issues with OCD ... checking things, it's very common, double checking, triple checking, it's an anxiety disorder."Rowling has spoken openly in the past about dealing with depression, which she estimated she had not had to deal with for more than a decade.She credited Harry Potter with helping. "Forget the money," she said; it gave her self-respect. "Harry gave me a job that I loved to do more than anything else," she told ABC.(Additional reporting by Mike Collett-White in London, editing by Jill Serjeant and Gunna Dickson)	4	3	3	3	3	2	2	4	3	2	3	2	1	1	4 	4

511	rules-could-oscar-documentary-field-different-look-192323775	LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Submissions for the Academy's Best Documentary Feature award have now closed, and a change in rules means the field of nominees could have a very different look this yearBear in mind, it probably won't be different enough to include the year's top-grossing doc, "2016 Obama's America" - though it'd be the very definition of irony if that conservative film made the cut, since the new rules that could alter the Oscar doc landscape were spearheaded by Documentary Branch governor and famous liberal Michael Moore.Under new rules proposed by Moore and passed by the branch and the Board of Governors last year, more members will be eligible to vote for the docs in the nominating process - and when their votes are tallied, it will be done using the preferential system, which often awards love-it-or-hate-it movies rather than the safer consensus favorites that prospered under the old system.It could mean that the Academy will find room for more of the pop-culture or social docs that were often overlooked under the old system in favor of straightforward issue-oriented films; movies like "Searching for Sugar Man," "Paul Williams Still Alive," "Wish Me Away," "Marley," "Jiro Dreams of Sushi," "The Iran Job" and "The Queen of Versailles" might find it easier to get the needed support than they would have last year.And "Samsara," the wordless and narrative-free doc that has done surprisingly well at the box office, seems tailor-made for the new rules - it's a thoroughly unconventional doc that could well be dismissed by a small committee, but might win enough passionate adherents in a larger body of voters.It's also hard to imagine that harder-hitting docs that were overlooked in past years - Werner Herzog's "Into the Abyss" and Steve James' "The Interrupters" among them - wouldn't be able to garner enough support to at least move to the 15-film shortlist under the new system.As to whether the new process will help 2012's three top-grossing docs, "2016 Obama's America," "Chimpanzee" and "Katy Perry: Part of Me" - well, that seems far-fetched, new system or not.Nature films like "Chimpanzee" haven't been a typical part of the lineup for decades, concert films almost never get in, and while the anti-Obama movie has played well to conservative audiences (not exactly the Academy's constituency), few have accused it of being a quality piece of cinema.We won't know how it all plays out until January, when the nominations are announced, or November, when the shortlist is revealed. But while the initial reaction to the new rules was focused on the requirement that qualifying films receive a review in the New York Times or the Los Angeles Times, the controversy over that rule was something of a red herring.In the long run, opening up the pool of voters and moving to the preferential count will likely have a bigger impact on the films that are nominated.Here's how the major change works:In the past, the first round of voting for the doc awards was in the hands of small screening committees. These groups of volunteers from the branch would received a randomly-selected batch of DVDs, and would give each film a numerical score; the films with the 15 highest scores would move on to a shortlist.Moore said that the committees could contain as few as five members, placing the fate of each film in the hands of an inordinately small number of members.The new system does away with the committees and the scoring system. Instead, all members of the branch, about 150, will receive screeners of all the eligible films (prepared and sent out at Academy expense), and will simply vote for their five favorites.That brings the voting in line with most other Oscar categories - which also means that ballots in the category will be counted using the preferential system, a complicated process that sorts ballots by the film listed first, and then redistributes them round-by-round until only five films remain.The preferential system places heavy weight on a voter's first choice and makes it far better to be passionately loved by a minority of voters than mildly liked by a majority. A film that is ranked first on only 10 of the ballots will automatically make the 15-film shortlist, while a movie ranked third or fourth on 50 ballots may well be left off the list.That means the emphasis could shift from the consensus films that prospered under the averaged-score system to more daring and divisive films that can do well under the preferential process.As for what films might end up on the shortlist, a few titles stand out: Kirby Dick's devastating rape-in-the-military doc "The Invisible War," Lee Hirsch's powerful "Bully," Amy Berg's "West of Memphis" (which will have to face the hurdle of having a film on the same subject, "Paradise Lost 3," nominated last year), Alex Gibney's Catholic Church expose "Mea Maxima Culpa," David France's AIDS doc "How to Survive a Plague," Eugene Jarecki's drug-war doc "The House We Live In" and Malik Bendjelloul's tremendously entertaining "Searching for Sugar Man."2012 docs that have grossed more than $1 million at the box office, in addition to "Sugar Man," "Bully," "Marley" and "Obama's America," include Lauren Greenfield's keenly-observed tale of excess among the super-rich, "The Queen of Versailles," and the Disney nature doc "Chimpanzee." (The former is a more likely nominee than the latter.)Director Steve James, whose "Hoop Dreams" was snubbed two decades ago, leading to a previous overhaul of the doc system, and whose 2011 film "The Interrupters" caused an outcry last year when it was left off the shortlist, is back with "Head Games," about sports-related concussions.Other possibilities include "Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry," "Beauty Is Embarrassing," "The Central Park Five," "Chasing Ice," "Detropia," "Escape Fire," "Ethel," "The Gatekeepers," "The Imposter," "Last Call at the Oasis," "The Law in These Parts," "One Day on Earth," "The Waiting Room" and the Keanu Reeves-produced "Side by Side," a series of conversations about the future of film in the digital age.But it's hard to determine which films have qualified; many of the most acclaimed docs have screened on the film-festival circuit, which itself does not give a film the one-week Los Angeles and New York runs required to qualify.Last year's field consisted of more than 100 documentaries. This year's, which is expected to be slightly smaller under tightened qualifying rules, will be set by the number of films that submitted their paperwork by the end of the day on Monday, and completed their qualifying runs by the end of the year.By mid-November, when the shortlist is revealed, we should know if Michael Moore's new rules have changed the look of the Oscar doc landscape. And Moore should know if by making the process more democratic, he also opened the door for a filmmaker on the opposite side of the political spectrum.But he's probably not losing any sleep over it.	2	2	4	3	4	4	3	2	2	4	3	2	2	2	3	4
512	russian-tv-host-gets-2-million-back-govt-193933039	MOSCOW (AP) — A glamorous Russian TV host who has emerged as a face of anti-Kremlin protests has won an unlikely victory in her battle against the government by seeing the return of nearly $2 million seized by authorities.Russian investigators seized the cash during a search of Ksenia Sobchak's apartment in Moscow in June. Sobchak said she was keeping the money at home because she didn't trust Russian banks.The authorities action was widely seen as part of a crackdown on dissent that followed President Vladimir Putin's inauguration to a third term in May. Sobchak is the only daughter of St. Petersburg's late mayor, who was Putin's boss in the 1990s.Russia's top Investigative Committee said Thursday it sent the money back to Sobchak after seeing no evidence of tax dodging.	2	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	1	2	2	2	2	2	4

For those who like keeping their files within reach on their smartphones and tablets, the need for high-capacity storage is a must. While most people will feel 64GB of storage on a smartphone or tablet is overkill, there will always be users who need more. Samsung (005930) announced this week that it has already begun mass producing “the industry’s highest density 128GB embedded NAND storage.” The chips are capable of reading data at 140MB/s and writing data at 50MB/s. “With 128GB of the new embedded memory storage, mobile handsets and tablet PCs can store up to 15 full HD, 8GB equivalent video files.” Samsung didn’t announce any new smartphones that will utilize the new 128GB chips yet, but it’s safe to say they will probably show up in a future revision of the Galaxy S smartphones or iPhone.ReadGet more from BGR.com: Follow us on Twitter, Facebook	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	4	2	2	1	1	2

517	sars-virus-detected-middle-east-070206993	British health authorities have alerted the U.N. of a new respiratory virus in a severely ill patient from Qatar.The man was sickened by a coronavirus, which causes most common colds but also causes SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. In 2003, SARS killed hundreds of people, mostly in Asia, in a short-lived outbreak.Britain's Health Protection Agency said in a statement late Sunday that the 49-year-old patient had recently traveled to Saudi Arabia.The U.N. health agency says virus samples from the patient were almost identical to those of a 60-year-old Saudi national who died earlier this year.The World Health Organization says it is trying to determine the public health implications of the two cases but isn't currently recommending travel restrictions.	3	3	3	4	2	3	2	2	4	2	4	1	1	3	3	4
518	sars-virus-reported-middle-east-181612631	A SARS-related virus has killed one man this year and recently made another ill, prompting the World Health Organization to issue a global alert about the disease.A 49-year-old man from Qatar is being treated in London for a new coronavirus, and Time reported that earlier this year a patient from Saudi Arabia died of a virus that was extremely similar. Those two cases have scientists wondering if the virus could be spreading in the Middle East.Coronaviruses affect the upper respiratory tract, and some also take hold in the gastrointestinal tract and the lower respiratory tract. While coronaviruses make up some cases of the common cold, they’re also responsible for more virulent infections such as SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.MORE: Contagion: How a Virus Changes the World (Video)A SARS outbreak in 2003 caused 774 deaths and 8,098 cases of illness around the world, WHO reports, which is why the organization is keeping a close eye on this small outbreak.According to the WHO report the Qatari man was healthy prior to becoming ill, and had traveled to Saudi Arabia before showing symptoms on September 3rd. He was admitted to an intensive care unit in Doha, Qatar on September 7th, and four days later was airlifted to London. The man has acute respiratory syndrome with kidney failure.A UK lab test confirmed that his illness was caused by a new coronavirus, and WHO is collecting more information to see how much of a public health risk the two cases pose. In the meantime, no travel restrictions are recommended. The Hajj pilgrimage, which brings millions to Mecca, is scheduled for late October.MORE: FDA Announces This Year's Flu VaccineSymptoms of SARS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, start with a high fever and may advance to headache, body aches and mild respiratory problems. Most cases progress to pneumonia, and there is no vaccine.The virus spreads due to close human-to-human contact via coughing and sneezing, but also can be picked up from touching a contaminated surface and could be spread through the air.The Associated Press quoted WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl on the outbreak as saying, “It's still (in the) very early days. At the moment, we have two sporadic cases and there are still a lot of holes to be filled in.”Michael Osterholm, a flu expert at the University of Minnesota , told AP that it’s important to verify how many mild and severe cases are out there: “We don't know if this is going to turn into another SARS or if it will disappear into nothing,” he said.How worried are you about another SARS epidemic?

519	scary-medicare-claims-141101605	A new TV ad in Florida harkens back to the notorious “death panel” falsehood. It wrongly claims Medicare benefits could be “rationed” and seniors denied treatment by the new health care law. In fact, the law specifically forbids rationing or restriction of benefits.American Crossroads, a super PAC launched with the help of Karl Rove, adviser to President George W. Bush, attacks Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in the ad, which features a gloomy gray-colored hospital bed with the word “rationed” in red capital letters resting on top of it. The ad’s announcer says: “This is where seniors could find out their Medicare benefits have been rationed or don’t cover their treatments.”The ad goes on to blame the so-called “rationing” on a board charged with recommending ways to slow the growth in Medicare spending. It says this “unelected board” would “decide what gets covered here,” showing a hospital room again.But the law doesn’t establish any kind of board that would make decisions on what care seniors get as they’re waiting in hospital beds, or anywhere else. The ad reminds us of long-ago-debunked claims from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who first claimed the law would establish “death panels” that would decide who gets health care and who doesn’t. Palin pointed to a provision that said Medicare would pay for voluntary counseling sessions for seniors to discuss end-of-life planning with health care professionals. She later pointed to the “unelected board” referenced in the American Crossroads ad.But the board, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, cannot, by law, “ration” care or determine which treatments Medicare covers. In fact, the IPAB is limited in what it can do to curb the growth of Medicare spending.It can’t restrict benefits or eligibility, increase premiums or taxes, or “ration” health care, according to the Affordable Care Act.Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, page 490: The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1818, 1818A, or 1839, increase Medicare beneficiary costsharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria.The Kaiser Family Foundation analysis said that the IPAB would be effectively restricted to finding savings from “Medicare Advantage, the Part D prescription drug program, skilled nursing facility, home health, dialysis, ambulance and ambulatory surgical center services, and durable medical equipment.”The 15-member IPAB would make recommendations for cutting spending that could only be overridden with a three-fifths majority of both houses of Congress, or Congress could institute its own reductions of an equal amount to what the IPAB puts forth. So the ad gets a point for correctly saying the board’s recommendations “could go into effect without congressional approval.” But that’s about the only bit of fact in yet another example of Mediscare in this election cycle.The American Crossroads ad also calls the 15 members of the board “unelected bureaucrats.” But as we’ve pointed out many times, the law says the members must include national health care experts, physicians and other health care professionals, economists, and representatives of consumers and seniors. They’ll be appointed by the president with the “advice and consent of the Senate.”The ad cites a July 13, 2011, article in The Hill newspaper as the source of its “rationed” claim. But The Hill’s article that day on the IPAB simply says that Republicans were claiming that the board would “ration care.” The headline: “GOP aims for focused IPAB attack.”An attack on the health care law wouldn’t be complete without the misleading claim that it’s “cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion.” That’s a $700 billion reduction in the growth of spending over 10 years, and, if it happens, a necessary step to prolong the solvency of Medicare Part A, which covers payments to hospitals.The ad wraps up its attack on Nelson by saying he “cast the deciding vote for Obamacare.” Nelson did vote for the bill — but he wasn’t any more critical to its passage than any other senator. And this isn’t the first time his vote has been given extra, and unwarranted, significance. The conservative 60 Plus Association said Nelson cast “a deciding vote” in an ad that was launched in June. As we said then, it was another Nelson, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who was one of the last Democrats to say he’d vote for the bill. Sen. Bill Nelson has pointed that out on his Facebook page.– Lori Robertson	3	4	2	4	3	4	3	4	3	2	3	3	2	2	3	4
520	schmidt-autographs-getting-way-too-hard-read-151715827--mlb	Since when did the signatures of today's celebrity athletes become worse than your local physician's scrawl on a prescription slip?Yes, I know, some now put their uniform number under their scribble. Have the constant paparazzi-like, autograph-stalking fans caused players to rebel by putting a bumpy line with a number as their autograph? Is it the chicken scratch on the ball that fans seek, or is it just being able to say, "I was there"?This spring, while with the Phillies in camp, I asked the clubhouse guy to get me some famous Phillies on balls for my charity auction. I must sign thousands every year for charity. It's funny how you get tired of the same requests over and over until you need one.Anyway, I get 10 signed balls given to me in a box that I bring home. A few weeks later, I'm doing inventory on some items I have gotten for the auction and I open the box of balls and I can't read any of the signatures. I study and study, hoping to see a curve or a clue that would lead me to the name.I asked my wife if she recognized any. None. I made out Roy Halladay, Jim Thome and Jimmy Rollins. A couple had the number — thank you Chase Utley, Ryan Howard, Cliff Lee and Hunter Pence. That was a great clue, at least for me, but what about the person who buys it at the auction and may not know the numbers?Signatures became valuable on collectible items back in the 1980s. At least that's my recollection. The autograph itself has been a cherished item for as long as I can remember. I stood next to the players' field entrance at Crosley Field in Cincinnati as a kid in the '60s one night hoping to get Willie Mays. No such luck.I have signatures I value, not because they are worth money, but because of how they were given to me.As a kid, my grandmother was on a plane with Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. How that happened, I don't know, but she brought me all three of their names on business cards. The first says "Best Wishes, Gary Player." The next says "Good Luck Mike, Jack Nicklaus." The next is "To Mike, Best Wishes, Arnold Palmer." All say "Sept 11, 62," which I believe my grandmother wrote in the corner.I was 12 years old in 1962. I'm looking at these cards now, I know all these men personally, have played golf with them, I know Player's and Nicklaus' kids. I was given the autographs 50 years ago of these famous golfers and I still have them. I can read them. You could read them. That's when an autograph was just that — a memory, an experience, something to look at that reminds you of good times.I remember signing my first autograph in 1970. It was after the first game of the College World Series with Ohio University. We beat Southern California, and as we were boarding the bus a little kid had a ball and we all signed it. I thought it was the greatest thing, putting my signature on a baseball. The first of a zillion, every one of which can be recognized.As most all of us who have taken advantage of our signatures having value, I have profited immensely from the memorabilia industry. Quite honestly, it has kept many of us from having to find a job after our careers ended, and for that we are thankful.My signature's value has never changed over the years. Sure, I know there is a class system in the industry, certain signatures retain value and others don't. In my case, one reason it has retained value is it's neat and you can read it. It is legible, shows respect and looks as though I put some effort into the process of creating a collectible item.I'm not in the class of Andre Dawson or the late Harmon Killebrew. Their signatures are artwork. Their slow, methodical signing technique shows immense respect for their names and the items on which they appear.What's the point? The point is this generation and its athletes have allowed the autograph phenomenon to assimilate into a game, of sorts. Who will be where and when, and what scam do seekers need to run to take advantage of the moment? It's a game the fans and players play every day. Collectors using small children and pretty girlfriends to get sellable merchandise, hiding out at various locations with briefcases, planning their attack just to get a scribble.No longer a handshake, smile and a short conversation and the personalized autograph that seals the memory. Now you get a scribble. And for some reason, fans accept it as normal.So, I got my dozen balls for the charity auction. I was excited that those guys scribbled for me, but I had to put some sort of sign next to each ball so people would know who signed them.Am I off base here, thinking that there is some link to one's level of respect for his signature as it relates to his respect for where it might be displayed? Or has the environment hardened the players to the point of not caring either way?Don't be surprised if the future of those famous athletes' autographs is simply their uniform number. Why not? At least you can read it. And it suffices for proof that the fan and the athlete shared space. Actually, I think a stamp makes more sense. Think about it, conversations aren't part of it, handshakes either, why not a legible stamp? Bop, bop, bop — think how many more can be done in the same time, albeit the value of each one would certainly drop.Probably too much to ask for a wholesale change in attitude from both sides. As if the players will sign neat and speak to the fans while signing, and fans and collectors will respect the player's right to privacy in certain areas and not stalk them near hotels and airports.Autograph utopia: Neat signatures, kind words, handshakes, no pushing or shoving, quality opposed to quantity. Any chance?Me, I just want to know which Phillies signed those balls.	5	4	3	4	5	3	3	4	3	2	4	3	3	2	4	
521	screen-adults-alcohol-misuse-task-force-210715718	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Health providers should screen all adults and pregnant women for risky drinking habits, a government-backed expert panel said Monday in new draft recommendations.The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines were released along with a summary of past research showing a few brief counseling sessions can help cut excessive drinking in people who aren't full-blown alcoholics.Researchers found that with such interventions, at least one in every ten risky drinkers can be brought back down to what is considered a safe drinking level.For men, that means no more than four drinks on any one occasion and at most 14 a week. For women, the numbers are three and seven, respectively."The really good interventions incorporate self-help materials, they incorporate an action plan made by the doctor and the patient - they're not just a prescription," said Dr. Daniel Jonas of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who led the research review but is not part of the USPSTF.It's estimated that about one in three Americans drink too much. Most of the misuse is known as risky or hazardous drinking, which doesn't involve physical dependence or diseases, but nonetheless has been linked to accidents and premature deaths.The new draft recommendations repeat the USPSTF's previous position from 2004, noting that the evidence is still insufficient to give advice regarding adolescents.They are based on the research update from Jonas and colleagues, which included 23 trials of alcohol counseling; each trial had anywhere from 72 to more than 1,500 people and lasted from six to 48 months.One of the most effective screening techniques is simply asking a person if he or she has had five or more drinks on any one occasion over the past year, said Jonas.If the answer is yes, the health provider should gauge the level of misuse. If it's limited to risky use, not yet causing direct physical or mental harm, then a few counseling sessions with the doctor can be helpful."The poster-child for these interventions was two visits with the primary care doctor, each one about 10 to 15 minutes and about a month apart and each one with a follow-up call from a nurse to reinforce the behavior," Jonas told Reuters Health.He and his colleagues found such interventions cut the average weekly alcohol use by 3.6 drinks on average compared with no intervention. They also reduced binge drinking by 12 percentage points and risky drinking by 11 percentage points.That means nine people would need to be counseled for one to cut back to safe drinking levels. And that might even be an underestimate of the true benefit of counseling, said Jonas. That's because even people who didn't get counseling had been screened, making them aware they drank too much and possibly leading them to cut back.Screening and counseling has little potential to do harm, according to the researcher. Still, there is no proof that drinking less actually leads to fewer accidents or deaths, which is why the task force gave the recommendation a grade "B" instead of a "A."Jonas acknowledged that with about a fifth of Americans being "risky drinkers," a universal screening program could be pricey. While Medicare reimburses doctors for it, it's time out of the calendar for both patients and health providers."That is really the biggest challenge with implementing this," Jonas said, adding that UNC is in the process of training its doctors to do the screening."Training is a big piece of it too, because a lot of providers need to learn how to do it," the researcher said.The USPSTF's draft guidelines are open for public comments until October 22.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/TeYLw9 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and http://bit.ly/N0G6LY Annals of Internal Medicine, online September 24, 2012.	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	2	3	2	2	2	3	4
522	sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897	MONTEREY, Calif. — The world's oceans are getting more acidic, a phenomenon predicted to wreak havoc on most sea life. But some organisms are performing better in these caustic conditions than researchers had anticipated, raising questions about what the oceans will look like in the future."We know evolution can occur on relatively short ecological timescales," said Gretchen Hofmann, a biologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, at the Third International Symposium on the Oceans in a High CO2 World meeting last week. She added that the big remaining question is which species will survive, and which won't be able to cope.As carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere (as a result of burning fossil fuels), about a quarter of that atmospheric carbon makes its way into the oceans, where it dissolves and makes the waters more acidic. Currently, because of this process, the oceans are about 30 percent more acidic than they were at the start of the industrial revolution.Species that make shells out of calcium carbonate are particularly compromised in acidic waters, where the carbonate ions needed for shell-making are not available. But other ocean-dwellers that rely on protein instead of calcium carbonate to create shells fare better. For instance, small crablike arthropods about the size of sand fleas actually increase productivity in extremely acidified water, said Kristy Kroeker, a biology doctoral student at Stanford University. "These are rapidly growing, small-bodied creatures with larvae that crawl instead of swim, and they actually do very well," Kroeker told LiveScience. [Spectacular Photos of Sea Creatures]Hofmann's lab has found that purple sea urchins are able to cope with highly acidic waters, probably because of the amount of genetic diversity within the species. The group collected sea urchins from a spot off the Oregon coast that has naturally high acidity from the upwelling of deep ocean water. In the lab, the researchers compared the genetic data of these urchins when raised at high-acidity and normal-acidity conditions, finding 150 genes turned on that helped the urchins move calcium around their systems.In addition to urchins, some corals tolerate the changing oceans better than others. Katharina Fabricius, a coral reef ecologist with the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said that colorful branching coral can't cope with higher temperatures and ocean acidity, but massive boulder corals and sea grasses survived in these conditions. Fabricius has worked in Papua New Guinea, along vents that bubble carbon dioxide into shallow water, giving a good experimental lab to researchers looking at future ocean conditions. [Photos of Colorful Corals]Her research suggests these reefs will still exist in 100 years. "But they would be much more simple. The complex species are unable to deal with high carbon dioxide situations," she said. Reefs are hope to hundreds of thousands of species, and replacing the branching coral — with its myriad nooks and crannies for habitat — with boulder coral means a drop in biodiversity. "If you don't have the structure, you don't have the habitat," Fabricius said.Other parts of the world share a similar story. Kroeker works in carbon-dioxide-bubbling vents off the coast of Italy. As waters become more acidic there, Kroeker explained, fewer patches of bright orange-and-pink algae can survive. "Instead, we see lots of fleshy seaweed. It looks like a dark mat on the seafloor." Kroeker’s 2010 meta-analysis detailed in the journal Ecology Letters also showed that crustaceans generally do better than other calcium-carbonate shell-making creatures. Some lobsters, prawns and crabs actually increase their shell-building when faced with more acidic waters.Even different algae species differ in their responses to ocean acidification. Dave Hutchins, a marine biologist at UCLA, said that harmful algae blooms like those that cause red tides are likely to produce more toxins in future ocean conditions."These blooms cost around $100 million per year in the U.S. alone, and may get more toxic in the future," Hutchins told LiveScience, adding that they're a special problem on the West Coast; sea lions washing up around the LA area were poisoned by algae called Pseudo-nitzschia that produce a powerful neurotoxin that leads to memory loss, nerve damage and death.A group of cyanobacteria called Trichodesmium that turn atmospheric nitrogen into a form other organisms can use for growth are also winners. His lab has looked at hundreds of generations of algae, and found that they produce far more nitrogen in high carbon-dioxide (CO2) conditions."For hundreds of generations, we grow them under lab conditions, and their production of nitrogen goes way up under high CO2," he said.Hutchins said he also found the algae couldn't scale back their nitrogen production, even when the carbon dioxide level drops. "They're stuck in an 'on' position, and we're trying to understand what that means in terms of marine food chains," he said.Ocean acidification also interferes with some fish's ability to sense predators. One bit of research presented at the conference showed that juvenile clownfish lost their ability to sniff out predators in high carbon-dioxide environments.	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	3	3
523	sea-ice-loss-means-development-arctic-143137347	NEW YORK — Arctic sea-ice extent shrank to an unprecedented low this summer, part of a long-term decline in the icy white cap over the far northern ocean.Researchers predict that nearly ice-free summers are on the way, although it’s not yet clear when this will happen. This shift has implications for climate — in particular, it is expected to aggravate global warming — and for the animals, such as polar bears and walruses, which depend on the ice for habitat.But the loss of ice over the Arctic Ocean also opens up the possibility for increased shipping, tourism, oil and gas exploration, and fishing. But this potential development raises challenges with which nations will have to grapple, said Anne Siders, a postdoctoral researcher with the Columbia Center for Climate Change Law, to an audience at Columbia University Wednesday (Sept. 19).Siders was among a panel of researchers who discussed the science behind the declining sea ice, the suite of changes occurring in the Arctic and public perception of it. [10 Things You Need to Know About Arctic Sea Ice]A predictably open Arctic Ocean creates opportunities and challenges for nations that ring the Arctic. Here are some of them.The opportunities:Fishing: Warming ocean temperatures, migrating fish and changes in sea ice may create conditions favorable to the development of new commercial fisheries within the Arctic, according to the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A U.S. plan, approved in 2009, temporarily prohibits commercial fishing in U.S. Arctic waters until more information is available.More ship traffic: A journey through the Northwest Passage north of Canada or along the Northern sea route over Russia can cut thousands of miles off a trip that could otherwise require a ship to travel through the Panama Canal or the Suez Canal. Between 1906 and 2006, only 69 ships traveled through the Northwest Passage, said Michael Byers, professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, in a recent article in the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. In 2010, 18 traveled through, and in 2011, 22 made the trip. As ice in the passage has dwindled, tourist trips on cruise ships and private yachts has increased, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reports.Gas and oil: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in 2008 that the Arctic holds a wealth of undiscovered energy reserves: 90 billion of barrels of oil, 1,670 trillion cubic feet (47.3 trillion cubic meters) of natural gas, and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids —most of it offshore. The quest for these resources is underway, in spite of setbacks. The oil company Shell announced on Monday(Sept. 17) it was delaying until next year plans to drill off the Alaskan Arctic coast. The loss of ice would make this prospecting easier.The problems:Inadequate maps: The increase in traffic brings up a navigation problem. NOAA's maps and other navigational information are unavailable or outdated in parts of the Arctic Ocean, because thick, impenetrable sea ice kept ships out. In addition, most Arctic waters that are charted were surveyed using obsolete technology dating back to the 1800s, according to NOAA.Little infrastructure or support: Alaska has twice the length of coastline as the lower 48 states, but the U.S. Coast Guard has extremely limited resources to devote to search-and-rescue operations or to oil spill cleanup, Siders said. Admiral Robert Papp, the Coast Guard commandant, has been quoted in the media as saying, "The Coast Guard has zero capability in the Arctic. … If we are going to have a permanent presence there, it's going to require some investment. We don't have the infrastructure in place right now." As an example of when things go wrong: In 2010, a cruise ship called the MV Clipper Adventurer ran aground in the Northwest Passage, and its passengers had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard. [Disasters at Sea: 6 Deadliest Shipwrecks]Territorial disagreements: The Arctic coastal nations, the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway and Denmark (Greenland is a Danish territory) are seeking to lay claim to territory far out over the continental shelves, but the United States can't lay its own claim and has little say in others’ because the U.S. is not a party to the U.N. Law of the Sea Treaty, CNN Money reports. There are other territorial issues as well, for instance, Canada maintains that the Northwest Passage is sovereign Canadian territory, while other nations, including the U.S., maintain that it is an international strait.The loss of summer ice will not, however, transform the Arctic into the Caribbean.“Some of the challenges to operating in the Arctic are and have been the same for a very long time,” Siders said, adding these will remain at least to some degree, requiring people to work “in the dark, in the cold, in the middle of a storm,” as earlier arrivals have done before.Follow LiveScience on Twitter @livescience.

524	seattle-city-council-votes-back-nba-arena-plan-015258382--nfl	OLYMPIA, Washington (Reuters) - The Seattle City Council on Monday voted 6-2 in favor of an arena financing deal with hedge fund manager and aspiring NBA franchise owner Chris Hansen that aims to lure the NBA back to the city.The Pacific Northwest city lost the Seattle SuperSonics to Oklahoma City in 2008, where the team was renamed the Thunder, after the owner faulted city officials for not coming up with a plan to build a new arena.The team's departure after four decades in Seattle angered basketball fans in the city, and officials are trying to bring back the National Basketball Association to town."This is about a can-do spirit, looking to the future and grabbing the opportunities that are being presented to our city," said Councilman Tim Burgess, who voted in favor of the financing deal.The arena deal builds on a memorandum of understanding struck in May to require an outlay of up to $200 million in public bonds to help pay for the $490 million project.That agreement was struck between hedge fund manager Chris Hansen, Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and King County Executive Dow Constantine.The public bonds would be repaid by taxes and rent payments generated from the arena."This may set a new bar for deals that cities strike with pro sports teams," said Seattle City Council President Sally J. Clark, who voted in favor of the agreement.The two council members voting against the deal acknowledged that their colleagues had extracted relatively favorable terms from Hansen and his partners but said that it was not enough."This revised agreement may prevent the most problematic outcomes," said Councilman Richard Conlin. "That does not mean that we will wind up benefiting from it or that it is a good use of the city's time, resources or financial capacity."The King County Council still needs to sign off on the deal before Hansen can begin shopping for a team. In a statement, King County Councilman Joe McDermott said the county body was likely to do so soon."I am certain we will stand together with a final in the next few weeks," McDermott said.Under the agreement, Seattle officials would create a $40 million transportation fund to help offset traffic congestion in the area that could worsen with the new arena.The new terms also include at least $2 million to spruce up the SuperSonics' old home, Key Arena, up to $5 million to help pay the rent for the WNBA's Seattle Storm should they wind up playing in the new arena, and a personal financial guarantee from Hansen on paying off the arena debt.Hansen could also be required to buy the new arena for $200 million after 30 years.The deal is contingent on an environmental assessment of the project that will include an exploration of alternate sites.Hansen has spent millions of dollars acquiring land near downtown for the proposed arena close to the stadiums of the Seattle Mariners baseball team and the NFL's Seattle Seahawks.Hansen's plan calls for having teams from both the NBA and the National Hockey League play in the new arena, but ground could be broken on the project for an NBA team alone."This is a magical day and a long time coming," said Kris Brannon, one of a handful of diehard green- and yellow-clad SuperSonics fans that cheered and hugged in the City Council chambers after the votes were tallied.The NBA franchise most often linked in media reports with a possible move to Seattle is the Sacramento Kings. The team previously expressed an interest in moving to Anaheim in southern California.(Editing by Tim Gaynor and Mohammad Zargham)	2	2	4	3	3	4	2	2	2	3	2	3	3	1	3	4
525	second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249	NAIROBI (Reuters) - A Kenyan junior minister was charged in court on Thursday with hate speech and inciting violence after calling on members of a tribe to leave a neighborhood in the capital Nairobi.Ferdinand Waititu is the second minister to be charged with inciting violence in two weeks, raising fears some politicians are still bent on stoking unrest for political gain ahead of a March presidential election.The prosecution told the court the assistant minister for water had said words "calculated to bring violence to members of the Maasai community living and working in Kayole," a densely-populated neighborhood in his Nairobi constituency of Embakasi.Waititu told the Maasai to leave the area on Monday after Maasai guards battered a street boy to death. He said: "We do not want to see members of the Maasai in Kayole from today," according to the prosecution.Two people were killed in fighting that broke out after Waititu's comments. Police are investigating whether the violence was linked to his remarks.Waititu was suspended from ministerial duties until the court case was concluded, President Mwai Kibaki's office said in a statement.Next year's vote will be the first since the International Criminal Court launched cases against four Kenyans, including two presidential contenders in the 2013 election, over accusations they masterminded tribal violence that killed more than 1,200 people following a disputed 2007 poll.Elections have traditionally been flashpoints of unrest in a country where political allegiances tend to be based on tribal loyalties rather than political ideology.Many Kenyans are wary of repeat clashes next year and a reconciliation body set up after the last bout of post-election violence has urged politicians to refrain from making inflammatory remarks.Mzalendo Kibunjia, who chairs the National Cohesion and Integration Commission in Kenya, said he hoped the judicial case against Waititu would deter other politicians from stoking unrest."Everybody who wants to campaign on those tired, old terrible politics, there will be no room for you. You had better learn new tricks of political mobilization," he told Reuters.Waititu, a political ally of deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta who is one of the four facing crimes against humanity charges at the International Criminal Court, was remanded in custody until the court decided whether to grant bail.APOLOGYWaititu, from Kenya's Kikuyu group, apologized for his remarks which he called a "slip of the tongue" but failed to stop the prosecutor pressing charges, a move broadly supported by a public tired with politicians showing little regard for the law.Earlier this month, President Mwai Kibaki sacked Assistant Livestock Minister Dhadho Godana who was accused of inciting violence in a dispute over land and water in Kenya's coastal region in which over 100 people have been killed.Godana pleaded not guilty and was released on bail.Waititu, who is running for governor of Nairobi, was bound to lose his position as assistant minister under the terms of a new constitution enacted in 2010.The constitution requires ministers to resign when they are charged with serious crimes, a measure designed to end decades of impunity.(Editing by Richard Lough and Andrew Heavens)	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	1	1	2	3	4

528	senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853	WASHINGTON (AP) — On its last day in session before the election, the Senate tied itself in knots over 41 polar bear carcasses that hunters want to bring home from Canada as big game trophies.After punting tough decisions on far weightier issues like raising taxes and cutting spending, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., insisted that the Senate address the wide-ranging sportsmen's bill before voting on must-pass legislation to prevent the government from shutting down at the end of next week.Republicans resisted for a while Friday, contending the only reason Reid wanted the vote now on the bill long sought by hunters and sport fishermen was to benefit Democratic incumbent Jon Tester 's re-election prospects in a tossup race in Montana that could determine which party runs the Senate next year."This isn't a campaign studio, It's the Senate," Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., complained on the Senate floor Friday. "We've got responsibilities to meet. Let's meet them. And leave the politics out of it for once."The House had passed a similar bill in April that was co-sponsored by Rep. Denny Rehberg, Tester's Republican opponent in the Montana Senate race. In the end, Tester would get only a test vote as the Senate, yet again, punted another issue until after the election.Tester's bill combines 19 measures favorable to outdoorsmen. In addition to dealing with the polar bear hides, it would allow more hunting and fishing on federal lands, let bow hunters cross federal land where hunting isn't allowed, encourage federal land agencies to cooperate with state and local authorities to maintain shooting ranges, exclude ammunition and tackle from federal environmental laws that regulate lead, boost fish populations and protect animal habitat.Tester suggested that Friday's compromise allowing for a test vote but delaying a final one exemplifies why Congress has such a poor approval rating from voters."That might take some of the politics out of it and if we ever made a decision here without politics it would be an earth shattering day," Tester said. "This bill right here is a prime example of what is wrong in Washington, D.C. — it's being held up for no reason whatsoever."The polar bear provision would allow the 41 hunters —including two in Montana — who killed polar bears in Canada just before a 2008 ban on polar bear trophy imports took effect to bring the bears' bodies across the border. The hunters involved were not able to bring the trophies home before the Fish and Wildlife Services listed them as a threatened species.Tester said it would just allow a few people who have polar bear trophies stored in Canada to finally bring them home. "These polar bears are dead, they are in cold storage and we know exactly who they are," he said.Michael Markarian of The Humane Society of the United States criticized the measure. "The cumulative impacts of incentivizing this killing over and over again are contrary to American conservation law," he said.	3	3	3	4	4	4	3	4	2	3	2	3	3	3	3	4
529	sequel-kings-novel-shining-due-september-2013-150441005	LONDON (Reuters) - More than three decades after "The Shining" was first published, the sequel to Stephen King's classic horror novel is finally coming out next year."Doctor Sleep" is due for publication on September 24, 2013, the U.S. author said on his website.The original book was published in 1977, and its success helped establish King's fame as a horror novelist."Scribner and Hodder & Stoughton have established September 24, 2013 as the official first publication date for Doctor Sleep, a sequel to The Shining," King said on his website.In 1980, "The Shining" was adapted into a film directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Jack Nicholson in the role of Jack Torrance, the troubled writer who moves his wife and psychic son, Danny, to the isolated Overlook Hotel in the Colorado mountains.In the sequel, Dan Torrance, no longer a boy but a middle-aged man, is still haunted by his father's legacy and the horrific childhood year he spent at the Overlook Hotel, according to a synopsis of the book posted on the website.He uses his gift - the shining - to comfort the dying in a New Hampshire town but his life is upset when he meets a 12-year-old girl who also has the shining and whom he "must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals," the website said.King has written some 50 novels, including "Carrie," "The Dead Zone" and "Misery."(Writing by Alessandra Rizzo, editing by Paul Casciato)	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	1	2	1	1	1	3	4
530	serb-acquitted-setting-fire-us-embassy-181342272	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — A Serbian court on Thursday acquitted the prime suspect charged with setting fire to the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade in 2008, but convicted him of the lesser offense of stealing property from the building and sentenced him to a year in prison.A Belgrade high court judge said there was no evidence that Milan Zivanovic, 24, took part in the burning of the embassy when Serb rioters stormed it on Feb. 21, 2008, in anger over Washington's support for the statehood of Kosovo, the predominantly ethnic Albanian province that had declared independence from Serbia.But the judge said Zivanovic, a university student, took part in the stealing of a leather jacket and gloves that belonged to an embassy employee. One assailant was killed in the fire set by the attackers.Apparently unhappy with the verdict, the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade said in a statement that it "will continue to monitor the course of appeals in this case, especially on the more serious charge of which the defendant was acquitted by the court. " It said: "We stress that it is important to pursue justice against all those, including those in authority, who ordered or otherwise supported this egregious violation."Zivanovic's lawyer, Bane Janev, said he is satisfied with the verdict, claiming his client was driven to attack the embassy "by a strong sense of patriotism."The attackers, mostly soccer hooligans, threw stones and flares at the embassy building, breaking windows and setting it on fire. The extremists also attacked other Western embassies in the Serbian capital.The incident caused tensions in U.S.-Serbia relations and triggered calls by American officials to bring to justice more perpetrators of the attack. Serbian authorities earlier this year charged another 14 people for the violence.Serbia lost control over Kosovo after a 1998-99 war but has refused to recognize its independence. About 10,000 people died during the conflict, which ended after NATO bombed Serbia to force it to stop the bloodshed.	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	3	3	2	3	1	1	2	3	4
531	serious-child-abuse-injuries-going-193450230	Despite a drop in the number of validated physical child abuse cases in the U.S., there’s been a slight increase in serious injuries due to child abuse. If the numbers don’t match up, what’s going on?The findings, published online in a study in the journal Pediatrics, worry some that the discrepancy may reflect changes in how cases are reported to child agencies and not indicative of a true downturn in cases of child abuse.Researchers from the Yale School of Medicine found that data from child protective services in the U.S. showed a 55 percent decline in verified cases of physical child abuse from 1992 to 2009 in the U.S. However, that data didn’t include the number of children who were hospitalized with significant injuries due to child abuse.MORE: The Scars No One Sees: Children Harmed by Psychological Abuse, Report FindsBut examining information from the Kids’ Inpatient Database, a group of pediatric hospital inpatient records, revealed a different story. Incidents of serious physical child abuse cases from 1997 to 2009 went up 4.9 percent. Cases included head injuries, fractures, abdominal injuries, burns and fractures.Lead author Dr. John Leventhal said in a news release that the varying numbers demonstrate the difficulty of using one source to get a handle on something like child abuse and the importance of developing useful prevention programs.“These results highlight the challenges of helping parents do better by their children and the importance of effective prevention programs to reduce serious abusive injuries in young children,” he said.Leventhal expanded on the reasons behind the discrepancy in a Reuters story: It may be more difficult now for child protective services to verify abuse allegations, and parents may be under more stress due to finances, causing them to take their stress and anger out on their children.MORE: Parents Get Physical With Their Kids in Public More Often than They May AdmitA study in Pediatrics in July found a parallel rise among home foreclosure rates and reported cases of child abuse and head injuries.Babies, Leventhal told Reuters, may be especially vulnerable to abuse. In the study, the increase in incidence of abuse among children under one year of age went up 10.9 percent."Infants tend to be hospitalized at a much higher rate than older children, and I think it's because the injuries they sustain are much more serious," he said.How can agencies that protect children do a better job of reporting child abuse?

532	seriously-delinquent-mortgages-hit-three-low-140324306--finance	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The percentage of seriously delinquent mortgages in the United States hit a three-year low in the second quarter, while the overall quality of mortgages remained little changed, a U.S. regulator said on Thursday.According to a report released by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 88.7 percent of mortgages were current on payments at the end of the second quarter, a slight decline from the prior quarter's rate of 88.9, and a small increase from 88.1 percent a year earlier.However, the percentage of seriously delinquent mortgages -- those that are at least 60 days past due or held by bankrupt borrowers — fell to 4.4 percent, the lowest level in three years. That represents a decline of 9.2 percent from a year ago.The OCC attributes the year-over-year change to improving economic conditions, servicing transfers and the ongoing effects of both home retention loan modification programs as well as home forfeiture actions.The percentage of mortgages in the second quarter that were 30 to 59 days past due stood at 2.8 percent, up 12.1 percent from the prior quarter but down 7.5 percent from a year ago.The report covers 30.5 million first-lien mortgages worth $5.2 trillion in outstanding balances. That is about 60 percent of all first-lien mortgages in the United States.(Reporting By Alexandra Alper; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)	4	4	5	3	3	3	4	4	3	4	4	1	2	1	4	4
533	shuttle-sightsee-around-calif-low-flyovers-080637432	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Space shuttle Endeavour will spend its last flying day Friday not rocketing into space, but doing what most tourists do when visiting California: Taking in the state Capitol, Golden Gate Bridge and the Hollywood Sign.In what promises to be a crowd-rousing air show, Endeavour, strapped atop a 747 jumbo jet, will take off after sunrise from Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert and dip low over various landmarks in a 4 1/2-hour sightseeing flight before landing at the Los Angeles International Airport.It's Endeavour's last aerial hurrah before it spends its retirement years as a museum piece."We're so excited to be welcoming Endeavour home in grand style with these flyovers," said Jeffrey Rudolph, president of the California Science Center, where the shuttle will go on permanent display.Since Endeavour will buzz by some of the Golden State's most iconic sights, law enforcement and transportation authorities warned motorists not to "gawk and drive.""We want people to take in this majestic show," Los Angeles police Cmdr. Scott Kroeber said earlier this week. "But if you're driving, please drive and don't try to take in the show simultaneously."Extra officers will be on duty along the freeways near LAX to make sure traffic flows smoothly as the shuttle zooms overhead.Endeavour returned to its birthplace Thursday after an emotional cross-country ferry flight that made a special flyover of Tucson, Ariz., to honor its last commander, Mark Kelly and his wife, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.Giffords, who is recovering from a gunshot wound to the head, was "hooting and hollering" as Endeavour looped around her hometown, according to her former aide C.J. Karamargin.NASA's shuttle fleet, which retired last year after three decades of flight, was assembled in Palmdale near Edwards Air Force Base. The military outpost 100 miles north of Los Angeles served as the original shuttle landing strip and remained a backup site in case of stormy weather at Cape Canaveral, Fla.The youngest shuttle, Endeavour replaced Challenger, which blew up during liftoff in 1986. NASA lost another shuttle, Columbia, in 2003 when it disintegrated during re-entry. Fourteen astronauts were killed.During 25 missions, Endeavour spent 299 days in space and orbited Earth nearly 4,700 times, racking up 123 million miles.On its maiden flight in 1992, a trio of spacewalking astronauts grabbed a stranded communications satellite in for repair. It also flew the first repair mission to the Hubble Space Telescope to fix a faulty mirror. But most of its flights ferried cargo and equipment to the International Space Station, which is near completion.Under White House orders to explore beyond low-Earth orbit, NASA is hitching rides on Russian rockets to the orbiting laboratory until private companies can provide regular service.Endeavour is the second of three remaining shuttles to head to its retirement home. In April, Discovery arrived at the Smithsonian Institution's hangar in Virginia. Atlantis, which closed out the shuttle program, will stay in Florida where it will be towed a short distance to the Kennedy Space Center's visitor center in the fall.Endeavour will remain at an airport hangar for several weeks as crews ready the shuttle for its own road trip. Unlike Atlantis, it will creep through city streets to the California Science Center near downtown.Some 400 trees will be cleared along the 12-mile route to make room, a move that has riled some residents in affected neighborhoods. Museum officials have pledged to replant double the number of chopped trees.___Online:Shuttle history: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttleCalifornia Science Center: http://www.californiasciencecenter.org___Alicia Chang can be followed at http://twitter.com/SciWriAlicia	4	4	3	3	4	2	2	3	3	2	3	2	1	1	3	4
534	sign-times-baseball-autographs-hi-tech-081720601--mlb	Jim Nash is such a big Yankees fan that he named his son George Mattingly Nash, combining two of his favorite players: George Herman Ruth and Don Mattingly.So when he noticed Mattingly was participating in a startup venture called Egraphs, which offered an autographed digital picture with a handwritten note and a personalized audio message, he didn't think twice about paying $50. Nash never would have walked up to the Los Angeles Dodgers manager and asked for his signature."It's much easier, especially for a grown man," the West Virginia native said. "It's much more personal."Egraphs launched at the All-Star break, a technological breakthrough that extends the autograph business from the age-old methods of writing to stars, leaning across ballpark railings and hanging around hotel lobbies.Now, power up the computer and get a prize from the likes of R.A. Dickey, Cliff Lee, Andrew McCutchen and Clayton Kershaw. Or even retired stars that include Pedro Martinez."It's actually kind of cool. It's like new age for me," Mattingly said.David Auld, a former Microsoft employee who is the Seattle-based company's chief executive officer, started the venture last October and brought in former major leaguer Gabe Kapler as director of business development. Kapler was contacted by Auld's brother, Brian, the senior vice president of business operations for the Tampa Bay Rays, Kapler's team from 2009-10."Taking the cold out of the autograph experience with the celebrity made a lot of sense," Kapler said.In an era in which players carry iPads and wireless has become more ever-present in clubhouses than smokeless tobacco, the idea seems to have caught on rather quickly. Among the early players to sign up were Tampa Bay's David Price and manager Joe Maddon.The company's website, www.egraphs.com, lists about 130 players, with several sold out — including David Ortiz, Josh Hamilton, Prince Fielder and CC Sabathia.Prices range from $25 to $100, depending on the player.For the players, the process is relatively easy and speedy."We built a custom iPad application," said David Auld, who used engineers he knew from high school. "They record an audio message through the iPad microphone."Consumers can share their Egraph on social networks and purchase a framed print with a certificate of authenticity. Each signature and recording is biometrically verified."It's cool. The best part of that is the audio," said New York Mets 20-game winner R.A. Dickey. "I get to give an audio message to a fan, which is pretty neat."Each of Dickey's messages is different."It all depends on the note that they write and what they share," he said.Among the audio messages thus far, St. Louis first baseman Matt Carpenter told a fan named Laura "if it wasn't for sugar-free vanilla pudding, I'd have no chance in the big leagues! Thanks for all your support — and Go Cards!"And Texas slugger Hamilton recorded this for a fan named Nancy: "Glad to hear you are doing well from the cancer. Cancer has been very prevalent in my family so my prayers go out to you and your family as well. Praying for good health and long life and a long time coming to Rangers' games. Best wishes and God bless."To make sure that the idea couldn't be copied within the sport, Egraphs obtained exclusive licenses with Major League Baseball and with Major League Baseball Advanced Media, its Internet division.Howard Smith, MLB's senior vice president of licensing, was impressed when he listened to Auld's pitch."Every month I get a really cool idea and say, 'How are you going to do that?'" explained Smith, entering his 15th year with the commissioner's office. "The technology they have in terms of safeguarding for the athlete, in terms of merchandizing, it has extensions well beyond this, well beyond autographs, well beyond licensed products."Auld won't divulge the volume of the company's sales. Kapler envisions an expansion to musicians and hopes for the day when Mariah Carey can send audio birthday greetings to fans. Auld sees minor leaguers getting involved to become better known to fans of their parent clubs and envisions international sports stars signing up.For Brandon Steiner, whose Steiner Sports sells autographed photos and memorabilia costing hundreds of dollars and more, Egraphs is something "aimed at the lower end of the market" and a product "that doesn't have legs.""I don't understand how that's a collectible," said Steiner, whose company began in 1987. "I don't understand why somebody would want that, a facsimile autograph. It's kind of like a replica jersey that people get when they're 6 years old."Mattingly, for one, likes the high-tech approach."Let's say you would sign for a Steiner or a different company like that, you would sign about 200 things. You don't know where they're going or how they're going. But this is kind of cool because you kind of have a little background of who it is and how they're connected with you. You actually get a message from the person, like: 'This is Bill and Angie. We're getting married, and we've been big fans of yours,'" he said. "And then when you leave your little voice mail, it's almost like saying: 'Hey Bill and Angie, congratulations on getting married. Thanks for being a fan.' So it actually feels a bit more personal than it would be if you were to do some of the stuff in bulk."You think about people that have baseball rooms that they put all their stuff in.

Fleming says marijuana possession in small amounts is a misdemeanour, while hashish in any quantity is a felony in Texas.Apple's publicist, Ambrosia Healy, didn't immediately respond to an email request for comment.The Sierra Blanca checkpoint inspects thousands of vehicles daily and sends the town thousands of drug cases yearly. Willie Nelson, Snoop Dogg and actor Armand Hammer have been arrested in Sierra Blanca on marijuana charges.	2	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	3	2	1	3	2	4
536	skiers-rowers-may-not-more-back-pain-161434317	NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Despite putting constant stress on their backs, rowers and cross-country skiers may not have any more chronic lower back pain than the rest of us, a new study suggests.Elite athletes in certain sports that ask a lot of the spine - like gymnastics and wrestling - have been found that have an increased risk of lower back pain.Rowers and cross-country skiers don't have to bend themselves backwards. But they do have to flex and extend their spines, over and over again."They expose their backs to monotonous movements for a number of years," said Ida Stange Foss, of the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Oslo, the lead researcher on the study.Yet in the long run, Foss's team found, elite rowers and skiers may have no more lower back woes than people who get their sports on TV.Of 415 former rowers and cross-country skiers surveyed, about 56 percent said they'd had any lower back pain in the past year. That compared with 53 percent of non-athletes - a difference that could have been due to chance."This is an important and positive message for the athletes," Foss said in an email.However, the news was not all good. Rowers and skiers who'd trained harder in the past year - more than 550 hours - were also more likely to have had a bout of low back pain in the past year.The pain was generally short-lived. "Most of the elite athletes reported a pain duration between one and seven days, (or) eight to 30 days during the past year," Foss said. "Very few reported pain lasting for more than one month."Still, that means active rowers and cross-country skiers might need to take steps to protect their backs."It is important for the athletes to prevent lower back pain through strengthening the core muscles and increasing the core stability, to better tolerate the high training volume," Foss said.The study, published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, included 173 rowers and 242 cross-country skiers who'd been surveyed back in 2000. Foss's team surveyed them again in 2010, asking about their training and exercise levels over the past decade, any problems with back pain.For comparison, the researchers surveyed 116 non-athletes and 209 athletes in orienteering - a sport that involves outdoor running and no specific strain on the back.Most people in each group - around two-thirds - said they'd had low back pain at some point in their lives. Of the athletes, 17 to 19 percent said they'd had pain in the past week, as did 20 percent of the less sporty group.Other studies have found that when it comes to exercise and back pain, extremes matter: Both couch potatoes and heavy-training athletes may be at increased risk.Back in the 2000 survey of these same athletes, the researchers did find that lower back pain became more common as rowers and skiers bumped up their training to get ready for competition.And cross-country skiers had more pain when they used "classic" techniques rather than "freestyle," Foss noted."These findings," she said, "indicate that it is important to vary movement patterns and techniques, especially during intense training periods."SOURCE: http://bit.ly/SEYPPl American Journal of Sports Medicine, online September 12, 2012.	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	2	3	2	2	3	4

538	skydiver-aims-supersonic-plunge-oct-8-143615657	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The countdown is on for skydiver Felix Baumgartner.In just two weeks, Baumgartner will attempt to go supersonic when he jumps from a record altitude of 23 miles over New Mexico. Project managers announced Tuesday the feat will take place Oct. 8.The Austrian parachutist jumped from 13 miles in March and 18 miles in July. This time, he hopes to break the all-time record of 19.5 miles set in 1960.Baumgartner's capsule was damaged in the latest practice jump and had to be repaired and retested. A giant helium balloon will hoist the pressurized capsule with Baumgartner inside, dressed in a pressure suit. Takeoff will be from Roswell.mBaumgartner expects to reach a top speed of 690 mph and break the sound barrier with only his body.	2	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	5
539	skyfall-listen-adeles-leaked-james-bond-theme-101000039	The song: Skyfall, the latest blockbuster in the James Bond franchise, won't be released in the U.S. until Nov. 9, but now, eager fans can get an early audio sample of the super-spy's upcoming adventure. A portion of "Skyfall," the breathlessly awaited theme song by Bristish songstress Adele, has hit the internet — and earlier than expected. (Listen to "Skyfall" below.) The single was originally slotted for release Thursday evening, but the first 90 seconds leaked days early. "Let the sky fall, when it crumbles, we will stand tall, and face it all together," Adele sings in the clip, which is smoother and jazzier than the rock-infused themes that have featured in Daniel Craig's past 007 films.The reaction: "Skyfall" is "a Bond song that actually stirs the heart," says Neil McCormick at the Daily Telegraph. Yes, "it's a beautiful ballad that promises to become a Bondian classic," Ajay Chowdhury of the James Bond International Fan Club tells the UK Press Association. "The pairing of singer and film seemed perfect at the outset," says Katey Rich at CinemaBlend, and this clip proves it: The soulful "Skyfall" hearkens back to classic James Bond themes like "Goldfinger," signaling that "the era of 'classic Bond' should be back with a vengeance" when Skyfall hits theaters.

540	smartphones-wrecking-family-budgets-123300452	The Labor Department this week reported what many Americans already know: The cost of having a smartphone is eating up an increasingly large chunk of monthly budgets. "More than half of all U.S. cell phone owners carry a device like the iPhone," says Anton Troianovski at The Wall Street Journal, and "people have spent more on phone bills over the past four years, even as they have dialed back on dining out, clothes, and entertainment — cutbacks that have been keenly felt in the restaurant, apparel, and film industries." Here, a guide to how smartphones are gobbling up our paychecks:How much has smartphone spending grown? American households on average spent $1,226 on their smartphones in 2011, up from $1,110 in 2007. While that may not sound like a huge increase, consider that total expenditures per family rose only $67 in that period. That means Americans were cutting back big time on other expenses. Since 2007, annual spending on food fell by $48, apparel by $141, and non-phone entertainment by $126.And are smartphones going to get more expensive? Yes. Just as consumers have grown accustomed to watching videos on their phones, wireless carriers are rolling out plans to squeeze out more money from data usage. "Streaming 30 minutes of video per day over a 4G connection and doing nothing else" can cost $120 a month on a new Verizon data plan, says Troianovski. Carriers earned $59 billion in data revenue in 2011, and they are expected to haul in an additional $50 billion per year by 2017.Will people spend less time on their smartphones? They certainly could cut back on their data usage, but ever since the iPhone came out in 2007, "nobody ever looked back," says Nathan Snyder at Android Authority. "The forbidden fruit had been digested into the heart and soul of Americans." This is just sad, says Hamilton Nolan at Gawker. "We are choosing to forgo going out in order to spend more time with our phones."Don't smartphones save families some money though? Yes. "Some of today's telephone spending means less spending elsewhere," says Ryan Chittum at The Columbia Journalism Review. "When one device consolidates functions formerly performed by the calendar, notebook, video camera, music player, map, newspaper, and more, you need to spend less on those things."And aren't there bigger factors affecting family budgets? Yes. Since 2007, costs for medical insurance, rent, and education have risen far faster than smartphones. "Cell phones aren't eating the family budget," says Derek Thompson at The Atlantic. "They're nibbling. The great devourers — housing, medicine, and education — are the same ravenous monsters we've been living with for decades."Sources: Android Authority, The Atlantic, Columbia Journalism Review, Gawker, The Wall Street JournalView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	1	1	3	4
541	sneaky-sundew-hurls-insects-trap-211242320	The twitchy tentacles of a sundew can catapult prey into the carnivorous plant's sticky traps in a fraction of a second, researchers say.These fast-moving snares are among the quickest seen yet in the plant kingdom, the scientists added.Researchers investigated a sundew plant from southern Australia, Drosera glanduligera, whose "flower" trap grows up to 1.5 inches (4 centimeters) wide. Sundews get their name from the sticky drops resembling the morning dew at the end of each of their tentacles. Carnivorous plants such as sundews go after meat to help them survive in the nutrient-poor soils they call home.Past research showed D. glanduligera has a way of ensnaring prey that is unique among carnivorous plants. In addition to its sticky tentacles, this sundew possesses longer, touch-sensitive tentacles that can snap forward, hurling insects at its flypaper-like glue traps. The sticky tentacles then slowly bend to move the prey to spoon-shaped leaves, from where it is slowly digested."Although the fast snap tentacles were basically known for decades, they received only very little attention from the scientific community," said researcher Thomas Speck, a biophysicist at the University of Freiburg in Germany. [Image Gallery: Wacky Carnivorous Plants]To show for the first time how these tentacles work, scientists collaborated with private sundew cultivators. They analyzed these plants with microscopes and high-speed video cameras in the lab, testing the sundews with fruit flies."D. glanduligera is not only extremely tough to cultivate by needing high-temperature fluctuations between day (above 20 degrees C) and night (close to zero degrees C) and regular feeding with flaked fish food and fruit flies, it also grows for only a few months from germination until seed production and wilting," wrote researcher Simon Poppinga, a botanist at the University of Freiburg in Germany, in an email. "We hence had a very small time slot to accomplish all experiments needed." In Fahrenheit that temperature range is 68 to 32 degrees.The secret to the quick tentacles probably involves releasing pent-up hydraulic pressure in a sudden burst, the researchers found. And it happens fast. The sundew takes about 75 milliseconds to catapult prey with snap tentacles, "which is by far the fastest motion reported from the sundew genus," Speck told LiveScience. "It is quick enough to outsmart walking prey animals, and is a bit faster than the snap-trapping action of the famous and closely related Venus flytrap and waterwheel plant."However, the title of fastest predator in the plant kingdom belongs to another plant, the bladderwort Utricularia, "which features traps that suck in their prey in less than a millisecond," Poppinga said.These snap tentacles are each one-shot weapons, with their hinges essentially breaking after they catapult, the researchers found. The sundew grows fast, developing new leaves every three to four days, so losing a snap tentacle to get food is apparently worth it.The researchers suggest the snap tentacles extend the range of each plant beyond just their glue traps and perhaps help them capture larger animals that might ordinarily be strong enough to free themselves from a sticky tentacle.Future research will endeavor to see how these carnivorous plants behave outside the lab in the wild and what prey they catch. "Fruit flies are definitely not the main prey in the natural habitat," Speck said.The scientists detailed their findings online Sept. 26 in the journal PLoS ONE.	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	3	3	1	1	1	4	4
542	snedeker-makes-push-fedex-cup-220435054--spt	ATLANTA (AP) — Brandt Snedeker had one of his best rounds of the year, a 6-under 64 on Saturday that gave him a share of the lead at the Tour Championship.It could turn out to be a round worth $10 million.Snedeker, in control of his game despite increasing wind at tree-lined East Lake, made a collection of tough putts and used his short game to pick up a couple of other birdies to wind up atop the leaderboard with Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free for a 68.Sunday at East Lake is the final day of the FedEx Cup, and it has never been more up for grabs among so many top players.Rory McIlroy had a 68 — his 11th consecutive round in the 60s — and was three shots behind. Tiger Woods salvaged an important par after bouncing a shot off a Georgia pine and had a 67 that put him four shots behind.McIlroy, Woods and Snedeker were among the top five seeds coming into the Tour Championship, meaning they only have to win Sunday to claim the FedEx Cup title and its $10 million bonus, the richest prize in golf."It's going to be one of the most exciting Sundays of the year," McIlroy said.They won't be the only players with a chance to win at least one trophy — the Tour Championship — on Sunday. Rose will be in the final group with Snedeker, and while it's unlikely he can win the FedEx Cup, the Englishman surely would settle for his second win of the year against a strong field.Snedeker and Rose were at 8-under 202.Ryan Moore spoiled his round with a bogey on the 17th and still had a 65, putting him alone in third at 6-under 204.Jim Furyk, the 36-hole leader, was tied for the lead until he pulled his tee shot into the water on the 17th, hit the next tee shot into the gallery, his fourth shot into a bunker and made triple bogey that sent him tumbling down to a 72. He was still in the mix at 205, along with McIlroy and Masters champion Bubba Watson, who had a double bogey on the 16th hole and shot 70.Typical of the FedEx Cup playoffs, there was plenty of star power in contention, with 11 of the top 14 players on the leaderboard headed to the Ryder Cup next week.For now, the attention shifts in a big way to the $10 million payoff."My first goal for this week is achieved," Snedeker said. "And that is to have a chance going into Sunday. It should be a lot of fun."Snedeker also shot a 64 in the second round of the British Open at Royal Lytham & St. Annes, though he rated this one as better. There was no wind at Lytham, and the conditions were relatively soft. East Lake demanded a crisp game as the wind rustled pine branches and the greens became firm."It was so tough today," Snedeker said. "The wind made it so hard to hit the fairways here because the wind seemed like it would move the ball 4 or 5 yards one way or the other, and these fairways might be 15 yards side. Just every iron shot has to be hit so crisply to control your distances, and I did a great job of that today."The next step for Snedeker is winning from the last group, something he has never done. The fast talker from Tennessee is the master of coming from behind on the last day. He is tied with Rose, with a number of stars behind him all aiming for the big prize — the Tour Championship, which also would bring the FedEx Cup."It looks like I've got a shot at it tomorrow," Woods said.He made two birdies on the back nine to stay in the chase, though no shot proved as valuable as the par on the 16th. From deep in the woods to the right of the fairway, Woods saw a tiny gap in the trees and was only concerned that with his ball sitting down in the rough, it might come out low or high. He forgot about the direction, pulled it slightly and it caromed off the tree and sideways into the fairway. From there, he stuffed his third shot into 12 feet and holed the putt for par.	3	2	2	2	4	3	3	3	3	4	2	3	3	2	3	4
543	soccer-angry-friedel-fires-twitter-broadside-ignorant-barthez-162536547--sow	(Fixes date in second par)LONDON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur's Brad Friedel has called former France keeper Fabien Barthez "ignorant and disrespectful" for saying current France No.1 Hugo Lloris should be starting for the Premier League club instead of him.Lloris joined Tottenham on the final day of the last transfer window for 12 million pounds ($19.51 million) and had been widely expected to go straight into the team.Friedel, however, has played in all four league matches this season with Lloris sitting out encounters against Norwich City and Reading and only making his debut in Thursday's goalless Europa League match against Lazio.Barthez, who won the World Cup with France in 1998 and played in the Premier League for Manchester United from 2000 until 2004, told Le Parisien newspaper: "Lloris is one of the five best goalkeepers in the world."He is faster than Friedel, he jumps higher and he is very strong mentally."What is happening now is incomprehensible, but I'm not concerned. He will become the centre-piece of the club. Hugo is a calm guy, a good worker. Tottenham will not let him stay on the bench for a long time."Friedel, 41, has made 308 consecutive Premier League appearances since 2004 for Blackburn Rovers, Aston Villa and Tottenham and the former U.S. keeper has been a reliable performer this season despite Spurs' slow start.He was so angered by Barthez's comments, he used his Twitter account "@friedel_f" to say: "Just saw Barthez comments."I normally don't comment on such crap but when disrespected by someone I don't respect I must. Barthez was ignorant, disrespectful and out of order to mention my name."Lloris told reporters after Thursday's match that he was set for a bright future at the club and was happy to bide his time."The choice lies with the coach but I'm here to shake things up a bit," Lloris told L'Equipe."I'm not worried, if Tottenham came looking for me at Lyon, then surely I will play a part in the future of the club. I just hope that I get the chance to play."To get a bit of playing time against Lazio while I'm still settling in, getting to know the club and my new team mates, that can only be a good thing."Tottenham, who won their first league match of the season against Reading last weekend, will look to continue their improvement against Queens Park Rangers at home this Sunday.

Maybe he thought I did something right."(But) we'll see if he keeps on tweeting."Also included in Hamren's squad were Ajax forward Tobias Sana and Fulham defender Alexander Kacaniklic."We've picked some new players. Kacaniklic is doing very well at Fulham. Sana looked exciting at Gothenburg, but what he has developed most at Ajax is producing points (goals and assists)."Sweden, who play the Faroes away in Torshavn on Oct. 12 and visit Germany four days later, are second in Group C on three points following an opening victory against Kazakhstan.

545	social-media-changing-diplomacy-163316558	Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advocates for what she calls "twenty-first century statecraft," the use of technology and social media by ambassadors and their staff to connect and engage with their local communities. But can Facebook and Twitter really change the art of diplomacy?[More from Mashable: 25 Dead Presidents to Follow on Twitter]That was one question posed to Deputy Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs for Digital Strategy at the State Department Victoria Esser, Indonesian Ambassador to the United States Dr. Dino Patti Djalal, Mexican Ambassador to the United States Arturo Sarukhan Casamitjana and American Ambassador to Zimbabwe Charles Ray during a panel at the 2012 Social Good Summit."[Social media] is an integral part of how we're conducting our diplomacy around the world, said Esser. "We have 300 Twitter profiles, 400 Facebook pages. To me, it's about creating virtuous circles online and offline -- nothing will replace face-to-face diplomacy, but social media is an important way to connect with people and cut away time, distance and diplomatic rank barriers and have a real conversation."[More from Mashable: 6 Pinterest Analytics Tools to Supercharge Your Influence]Esser pointed to a recent State Department experiment with Google Hangouts as an example of such a conversation."Earlier this year, we did a Google Hangout in Persian," said Esser. "We were trying to figure out a way to really engage in a dialogue in Iran, where we don't have a diplomatic presence."Esser, subtly acknowledging the situation at the American Embassy in Cairo wherein a staffer sent tweets later reported to have gone without authorization, also said that Washington largely gives individual missions free reign to tweet as they will."We've devolved [control] so missions in the field are responsible, with general guidance from Washington. You can't manage a tweet at a time, and it's important not to or it won't be authentic to the community you're trying to engage with. We recognize there will be bumps along the road, but as my colleague Alec Ross points out, the twenty-first century is a terrible time to be a control freak. If you want to engage in this dialogue, there's a certain loss in control involved."Ambassador Ray shared a unique story of using Facebook to circumvent a local government's obstructionism."When the government discovered our face-to-face meetings with young people were having an effect ... they started disrupted meetings. They hated it with a passion. So we came up with alternative, which was a wild suggestion at the time: A live Facebook chat, along with SMS, Twitter, and YouTube. In the first one, 200 people enrolled and we had 250 comments in the first 30 minutes."Facebook didn't replace face-to-face diplomacy, but it filled a gap, it became a tool we could use to do face-to-face diplomacy when that wasn't available."For Ambassador Djalal, Twitter especially has become a crucial mechanism for interacting with Indonesians at home and in the United States."If not for social media, I'd have no other medium to reach out to [Indonesians]," said Djalal, who only started tweeting when he first became an ambassador. "I recently made a tweet. . .I have about 100,00 followers. I said, 'if you want to give me a gift for my birthday, do one act of kindness.' A few hours later, the hundreds of replies I got were amazing: 'I proposed to my girlfriend,' 'I kissed my mom on the cheek.' That's when I realized. . .the power of social media. It has a remarkable use for the field of diplomacy."[wp_scm_sgs_2012]Images courtesy of Flickr, SEIU InternationalThis story originally published on Mashable here.	4	3	3	3	4	3	2	4	3	2	3	3	1	1	4	4

For "advertising and consulting," for example, weekend posts get 69% higher interaction, but only 11% of posts are published on Saturday and Sunday. Not every industry has the same pattern, though: Thursday is the biggest day of the week for "clothing and fashion" while Monday is the biggest for "general retail."[More from Mashable: The 10 Pages That Lost the Most Fans From Facebook’s Purge]In general, though, Hump Day is the worst day to post; interactions on Wednesday are 7.4% lower than average.Once again, the study also found that off-hours are the best time to post. Brand posts between 8 pm and 7 am got 14% higher interaction than those published between 8 am and 7 pm.Meanwhile, when it comes to posts, less is more. Brands that post one or two times a day see 19% higher interaction rates than those that publish three or more posts. "The key is not to bombard fans with too many posts, as Facebook News Feed optimization often penalizes for this," the report cautions.And while Twitter has a 140-character limit, Buddy Media suggests a self-imposed 80-character wall for Facebook posts. Such posts get a 23% higher interaction than longer posts. However, 75% of posts are beyond that limit. It's also a good idea to run photos -- photo posts get 39% higher interaction rates than average. Text-only posts aren't a bad option either, though: They get a 12% higher-than-average rate. Video and link posts appear to be the worst option: They have lower-than-average interaction rates.Among the other recommendations:This story originally published on Mashable here.	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	2	2	2	3	2	1	1	3	4

551	space-shuttle-endeavour-departs-florida-final-ferry-flight-114207846	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — For the last time in history, a space shuttle soared into the skies over Florida on Wednesday (Sept. 19). Rather than riding on rockets and heading into orbit however, the space shuttle Endeavour was mounted atop a jumbo jet and is destined for a California museum's display.The retired orbiter, mated to the space agency's modified Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) took off from the Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility, which was the same runway where Endeavour made its 25th and final return from space in June 2011. The 7:22 a.m. EDT (1122 GMT) liftoff marked the start of the final ferry flight for the 30-year space shuttle program.After taking to the air, Endeavour, riding piggyback on the SCA, embarked on a series of flyovers of Florida's Space Coast. The air- and- spacecraft duo flew over Kennedy and its visitor complex, the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Patrick Air Force Base before returning to the landing facility for one last low pass. It then headed west to cross out of the Sunshine State.Endeavour's final departure from Florida had been delayed twice by weather. The SCA with its last shuttle passenger aboard was originally scheduled to takeoff on Monday, but a low pressure front and associated thunderstorms along the planned flight path necessitated NASA postponing the takeoff to Wednesday.In April 2011, NASA awarded Endeavour to the California Science Center (CSC) in Los Angeles for its permanent display. The ferry flight is scheduled to touch down at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Friday (Sept. 21) at about 11 a.m. PDT (2 p.m. EDT; 1800 GMT). Before then, it will make flyovers and stopovers at NASA facilities and centers, as well as take scenic tours over many California landmarks. [How NASA Flies Shuttles on 747 Jumbo Jets (Photos)]The first leg on Endeavour's cross-country trip is taking it Houston, the home of the space shuttle program, Mission Control and NASA's astronaut corps.Endeavour's Ellington returnAfter leaving Florida, the SCA with Endeavour is expected to follow the I-10 traffic corridor along the Gulf Coast, at times lowering to 1,500 feet (460 kilometers) to perform flyovers of the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The two sites tested the shuttle engines and built the external fuel tanks, respectively.The ferry flight is expected to enter the Texas Gulf Coast region between 9 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. CDT (10-11:30 a.m. EDT; 1400-1530 GMT) and fly near a variety of landmarks in the greater Houston area, including the George Bush Intercontinental and William P. Hobby airports as well as the downtown skyline and the San Jacinto Monument. The SCA with Endeavour will also navigate a low flyover of NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC).At approximately 10:45 a.m. CDT (11:45 a.m. EDT; 1545 GMT), the SCA is expected to land at Ellington Field in Houston and taxi to NASA Hangar 990. Public viewing of the aircraft and Endeavour will begin a half hour after the vehicles are safely secured and continue until 9 p.m. (10 p.m. EDT, 0200 GMT).Endeavour's Ellington arrival on this, its final flight, brings this particular shuttle's history full circle. On May 9, 1991, Endeavour arrived at the same air field during a refueling stop on its very first ferry flight. Endeavour was on its way from California to Florida to be readied for its first mission, STS-49, which launched a year later.Ellington Field is the aircraft operations base for Johnson Space Center. In addition to the SCA, Ellington supports NASA's Super Guppy cargo plane, the now retired Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA) Gulfstream jets, and NASA's fleet of T-38 two-engine astronaut training jets.Go west, young shuttle, go westBefore the weather delayed its Florida departure, the SCA and Endeavour were to scheduled to stay in Houston for two days. Instead, the shuttle, atop the jetliner, will leave Ellington at sunrise on Thursday (Sept. 20).Ellington's runway is not quite long enough to support a fully-fueled, shuttle-carrying SCA for this flight, and so the jumbo jet will make an additional re-fueling stop at Biggs Army Air Field in El Paso, Texas, before continuing on its way to southern California.On the way, the SCA will make low flyovers of the White Sands Test Facility near Las Cruces, N.M., and NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California, prior to landing around mid-day at Dryden. Both sites were former landing locations for the shuttles when they returned from space.On the morning of Sept. 21, the SCA and Endeavour will take off for the last time and fly low passes over northern California, passing near NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field and by various landmarks in multiple cities, including Sacramento and San Francisco. The aircraft with Endeavour will also fly over many Los Angeles landmarks before touching down at LAX.Once on the ground and following a ceremony welcoming Endeavour to Los Angeles, the shuttle will be removed from the SCA and spend a few weeks at a United Airlines hangar undergoing preparations for transport and display. Endeavour will then travel through the streets of Inglewood and Los Angeles on a two-day, 12-mile (19-kilometer) road trip from the airport to the science center, arriving on the evening of Oct. 13.Beginning Oct. 30, the shuttle will debut on display in the science center's Samuel Oschin Space Shuttle Endeavour Display Pavilion, beginning its new educational mission to commemorate past achievements in space and inspire the next generations of explorers.Share your photos of the ferry flight with collectSPACE.com and SPACE.com!

554	spain-dedicated-fiscal-reform-sacrifice-must-spread-rajoy-173918388--business	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Spain is committed to fiscal and structural reforms and all parts of Spanish society will need to make sacrifices to achieve these ends, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Wednesday."We know what we have to do, and since we know it, we're doing it. We also know this entails a lot of sacrifices distributed ... evenly throughout the Spanish society," Rajoy said during an address to the Americas Society in New York.Violent protests in Madrid against tough economic reforms and growing secession talk in the wealthy Catalonia region have increased the pressure on the government to seek external aid to help get public finances in order.Spain has been reluctant to seek help, but in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week, Rajoy said he would seek a bailout if Spanish debt financing costs remained too high for too long.(Reporting By Steven C.

555	spain-economic-crisis-fans-catalan-separatism-060303603--business	MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's economic crisis is exposing deep regional fault lines. Among Catalans on Barcelona's boulevards the talk is of independence, and Madrid is worried.This week the king and prime minister called for national unity to get Spain through its worst downturn in decades, King Juan Carlos recalling the spirit that built a democracy after dictator Francisco Franco's death in 1975.Popular momentum for independence has never been stronger in Catalonia, a wealthy region in northeastern Spain that generates one fifth of the country's economic output and is home to 16 percent of Spaniards.More than half of Catalans say they want a separate state, and hundreds of thousands marched in Barcelona last week - the biggest such show of separatist fervor.Still, few see a rapid road to an independent Catalonia, a dream rooted in the Middle Ages when Barcelona was a Mediterranean trade centre with a parliament."It's going to be a difficult and long process ... For us to get it they would have to have a referendum, and they're not going to give us that," said Jose Maria Prats, a nurse who joined the march.The upsurge in Catalan separatism is founded on a conviction that Madrid is draining the region financially.The central government collects most taxation payments then redistributes them to Spain's 17 self-governing regions, which run their own schools and hospitals. Each year Catalans say they pay 16 billion euros more in taxes than the regional government spends."The crisis has shown that Spain's regional financing model does not work. There is no doubt we need to advance towards a federal system of taxation," said Jose Ignacio Conde-Ruiz, deputy head of think-tank FEDEA.The flare-up in Catalonia has come at a difficult time for Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy who is struggling to bring Spain's deficit under control and resisting following Greece, Ireland and Portugal into an international bailout.He has threatened to intervene in regions that cannot control their budgets. Catalonia is likely to miss its deficit target this year and has had to ask Madrid for a 5 billion euro bailout to meet its debt redemptions.DIFFERENCES RUN DEEPWith an economy about the size of Portugal's, Catalonia houses global firms including toll road, telecoms and airport operator Abertis and healthcare group Grifols.Children are schooled in Catalan and Spanish is treated as a foreign language in the home region of Joan Miro, Salvador Dali and Antoni Gaudi. Catalans banned bullfighting in a 2010 referendum highlighting their difference from the rest of Spain.Such proud expressions of regional identity were suppressed during Franco's rule from 1939-1975, and the regions only won significant autonomy under the 1978 constitution that marked the country's return to democracy.Catalan President Artur Mas, of the conservative Convergence and Union, or CiU, up until last week an advocate of autonomy but not of independence, has fallen into line with public opinion. He says he will work toward a referendum like the one Scotland may hold in 2014 on breaking its 305-year union with England."We went one way for 30 years and now there's a change in direction ... Catalonia needs instruments of state," he told Madrid's political and business elite at a forum last week.In Madrid, economists scoff at the Catalan argument that they contribute more in taxes, saying any wealthy region of any country could say the same. Economists in Catalonia say the gap between the money flowing to Madrid and the money flowing back to the region is wider than in Scotland.Even if it had to pay for its own military and diplomatic corps, the financial benefit to Catalonia would be equivalent to seven percent of its GDP, says Elisenda Paluzie, dean of the economics and business school at the University of Barcelona.Mas and Rajoy are scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss Mas's proposals to free Catalonia from the common tax regime.Secession would complicate Catalonia's relationship with Europe. The European Union says an independent Catalonia seceded it would have to reapply for membership of the bloc.(Additional reporting by Andres Gonzalez and Nigel Davies; Editing by Clare Kane and Janet McBride)	3	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	2	3	3	1	2	3	4
556	spain-loses-capital-july-13th-month-105648819--business	MADRID (Reuters) - Spain lost billions of euros in capital for a 13th consecutive month in July amid investor fears about its troubled and shrinking economy, although the rate of outflows slowed from the previous month.Bank of Spain data showed on Friday that capital outflows, excluding central bank operations, amounted to 15 billion euros ($19.3 billion) in July, down from 56.6 billion euros in June.A total of 331 billion euros of capital has left the country in the 13 months to end-July, equivalent to around a third of the output of the euro zone's fourth-largest economy.The reduced outflow from June to July was mostly due to fewer interbank operations that involved withdrawing money from Spain, one analyst said, adding that this was volatile data and that not too much should be read into it.Spain's current account was in surplus by 499.7 million euros in July, the data showed, up from a deficit of 257.2 million euros in June, partly due to inflows of summer tourism revenues.ECB governor Mario Draghi said in late July that the central bank would do 'whatever it takes' to preserve the euro, words that calmed panicked investors and led to an substantial easing in Spain's borrowing costs.The government announced more economic reforms and a tough 2013 budget this week in steps seen as preempting the strict terms of any international bailout to reduce the country's high borrowing costs.Spain is in talks with Brussels about the terms of a possible aid package that would trigger a European Central Bank bond-buying program.The Bank of Spain data is not the first to show a lessening of capital outflows in recent months.Consumers and firms pulled money out of Spanish banks in August at a slower rate than in July, although private sector deposits fell to a more than three-year low, ECB data showed on Thursday.($1 = 0.7775 euros)(Reporting By Sonya Dowsett, Additional reporting by Jesus Aguado; editing by Jane Baird)		3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	2	2	3	3	4

560	stocks-edge-midday-trading-162748667--finance	NEW YORK (AP) — Encouraging economic reports gave the stock market a nudge higher Tuesday. House prices rose in major cities for a third straight month, and a gauge of consumer confidence came in surprisingly high.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed gained as much as 61 points before falling back, and was up nine points at 13,567 just after noon EDT. Home Depot led the 30 stocks in the Dow, gaining 1.7 percent.The Standard & Poor's 500 index added a point to 1,458.Even more surprising than those two economic reports was the Richmond Federal Reserve's strong reading on regional manufacturing, a recent trouble spot, said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors."Look at that. There were three data points on the economy and we crushed them," said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. "I checked to see if the stock market is up, and it is. All is right with the world today."The closely watched Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller index of national house prices increased 1.2 percent in July compared with the same month in 2011. Prices rose from the previous month in all 20 major cities tracked by the report for the third month in a row.The Conference Board said its gauge of consumer confidence shot to a seven-month high in September, trumping forecasts by a large margin. People surveyed said they were more optimistic about the job market.The Federal Reserve's manufacturing index, which surveys companies in the central Atlantic region, increased after shrinking for three months as businesses turned more optimistic. Companies said they anticipate more orders and shipments even as employment dips. The index turned positive in September after a negative reading in August.In other trading, the Nasdaq composite index added five points to 3,166.

561	stocks-rise-following-expansion-manufacturing-193737202--finance	U.S. stocks mostly rose on Monday as growth in manufacturing provided more evidence that the economy may be picking up, or at least not getting any worse.The gains came after news that U.S. manufacturing grew in September for the first time in four months. Stocks had already been up in morning trading, but the gains accelerated after the report was released by the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers.A gauge of manufacturing employment rose following a decline in August. That's a hopeful sign that the government may report employment gains when it releases its monthly survey of the job market in Friday.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68 points to 13,505 in afternoon trading, after rising as much as 161 earlier in the day on the manufacturing news.Stocks gave up some of their gains after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed needs to keep interest rates low because the economy isn't growing fast enough to reduce high unemployment.Investors are looking for signs that workers will have more money to spend, said Jerry Webman, chief economist for OppenheilmerFunds Inc. That's a "virtuous cycle" that can generate some of its own fuel for a recovery."If you're going to manufacture more you're going to employ more people, and if you employ more people you're going to pay them money, and they're going to buy some stuff," helping the economy, Webman said.Also Monday, the government said U.S. builders spent more on home construction in August, the latest positive sign for the housing market.The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up three points at 1,443. The Nasdaq composite fell 11 points to 3,106.Utility stocks fell slightly, but the other nine industry groups in the S&P 500 rose.Goldman Sachs jumped $3, or 2.6 percent, to $116.68 after Barron's wrote that investors are too pessimistic on the investment bank's prospects.Other financial stocks rose, too. Of the 30 stocks in the Dow, the top two gainers were Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. BofA was up 19 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $9.02. JPMorgan rose 76 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $41.24.Monday was the first day of trading of the fourth quarter, and the early gains were a welcome change of pace from the way the last quarter ended. U.S. indices fell on Friday for the fifth day out of the previous six. Monday was only the third day since Sept. 17 that the S&P 500 has risen.Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said investors believe that the news about the economy has stopped getting worse. Besides the U.S. manufacturing news on Monday, she noted that recent data from China suggests that manufacturing has improved there as well."The numbers were still weak, but they were not as bad as before," Krosby said. "So that was a positive backdrop for the market."Wendy's Co. fell 24 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $4.29 after a Janney Capital Markets analyst lowered his rating on the stock, saying there are seeing signs that the hamburger chain's revenue won't be as strong as expected.Sprint Nextel Corp. fell 26 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $5.25 after Raymond James downgraded the shares because of the stock's recent rise.Markets around Europe rose. An audit of 14 Spanish banks showed the lenders need an extra $77.6 billion in capital. That's roughly what was expected, and well within the amount Madrid can get from fellow European countries.A slight improvement in a survey of the euro zone's manufacturing sector also helped.However, credit rating agency Moody's might downgrade Spain's debt to junk status this week.

562	stocks-sink-spain-report-mosaic-miss-171851781--finance	NEW YORK (AP) — A batch of mixed signals tugged major stock indexes lower on Tuesday.The country's largest fertilizer company, Mosaic, said weak demand from China and India weighed on its profits. Mosaic, Dupont and stocks of other companies in the materials industry fell.Stock indexes too another turn lower after Spain's prime minister said that he's not preparing a request for a bailout loan.The Dow Jones industrial average was down 59 points at 13,456 shortly after 1 p.m. Dupont led the Dow lower, sinking 68 cents to $49.68.Traders have been anticipating that the Spanish government would ask for help for nearly a month. Spain needs to ask for money from Europe's bailout fund before the European Central Bank can start buying its government bonds.The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped two points to 1,443, while the Nasdaq composite fell less than one point to 3,113.Utilities and health care stocks, where investors often retreat in a slow-growing economy, were among the few industry groups in the S&P 500 to rise. Material and energy companies sank the most.Mosaic reported net income and sales early Tuesday that fell short of analysts' estimates. The company blamed slumping demand for its fertilizer overseas as well as hurricanes for slower production. The results pushed the company's stock down $2.19 to $55.82.The market could look quiet until the government gives its monthly jobs report on Friday, said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at ING Investment Management. Economists expect the unemployment rate increased to 8.2 percent in September from 8.1 percent in August.Zemsky said a surprise swing up or down "could change the direction of the stock market and the Presidential election."Core Logic, a private provider of real estate data, said U.S. home prices in August rose 4.6 percent compared with the same month last year. Prices also rose 0.3 percent from July, the sixth consecutive month of gains.Other gauges of the housing market have improved in recent months, including home sales.On Monday, the manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management also showed improvement. ISM's main index nosed above 50, a reading that signals growth. The index had been below 50 from June through August.Investors are also looking ahead to quarterly earnings, which begin in earnest when the aluminum company Alcoa reports results Oct. 9.Elsewhere Tuesday, the price of benchmark crude oil rose 20 cents to $92.68 per barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note sank to 1.62 percent from 1.63 percent Monday after Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said a bailout request wasn't coming.European markets closed slightly lower before Rajoy spoke. Benchmark stock indexes fell 0.3 percent in Germany, 0.2 percent in Britain and 0.6 percent in France. Borrowing costs fell slightly for Spain and Italy.Among other stocks making big moves:— Reports that Deutsche Telekom may buy the cellphone carrier MetroPCS Communications sent MetroPCS's stock up 18 percent. Bloomberg News reported that the board of Deutsche Telekom, which owns T-Mobile USA, would vote to approve the deal Wednesday. MetroPCS gained $2.35 to $13.87.— PetSmart rose 85 cents to $68.41. Standard & Poor's said the pet-store chain will replace Sunoco in the S&P 500 index at the end of trading Thursday. The S&P 500 is the most commonly used benchmark for stock mutual funds. When a company joins the index, mutual fund managers are more likely to buy it. Sunoco was bought by Energy Transfer Partners.	3	2	3	3	3	2	3	3	3	3	3	2	1	2	3	4

574	sweeping-changes-expected-nkorean-farms-063200344--spt	SARIWON, North Korea (AP) — North Korean farmers who have long been required to turn most of their crops over to the state may instead be allowed to keep their surplus food to sell or barter in what could be the most significant economic change enacted by young leader Kim Jong Un since he came to power nine months ago.The proposed directive appears aimed at boosting productivity at collective farms that have struggled for decades to provide for the country's 24 million people. By giving farmers such an incentive to grow more food, North Korea could be starting down the same path as China when it first began experimenting with a market-based economy.Two workers at a farm south of Pyongyang told The Associated Press about the new rules on Sunday, saying they were informed of the proposed changes during meetings last month and that they should take effect with this year's upcoming fall harvest. The Ministry of Agriculture has not announced the changes, some of which have been widely rumored abroad but never previously made public outside North Korea's farms.Farmers currently must turn everything over to the state beyond what they are allowed to keep for their families. Under the new rules, they would be able to keep any surplus after they have fulfilled state-mandated quotas — improving morale and giving farmers more of a chance to manage their plots and use the crops as a commodity."We expect a good harvest this year," said O Yong Ae, who works at Migok Cooperative Farm in South Hwanghae Province, in southwestern North Korea, among the region's largest and most productive farms. "I'm happy because we can keep the crops we worked so hard to grow."The outside world has been watching closely to see how Kim's rule will differ from that of his autocratic father, Kim Jong Il, who died in December, and how he will deal with the country's chronic food shortages.The proposed changes mimic central elements of China's rural reform in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when China allowed farmers to hold onto their surplus after meeting state quotas, said John Delury, an assistant professor at Yonsei University in South Korea who specializes in Chinese and North Korean affairs.The result for China: a significant boost both for the economy and then-leader Deng Xiaoping's popularity."Of course, a major difference between the two cases is that the vast majority of the Chinese population were farmers at the time," he said. North Korea has fewer farmers and less arable land, and "will have to find its own formula for successful development."Kim Jong Un, who inherited a nation with chronic food, fuel and power shortages, has made improving the economy a hallmark of his nascent rule. In his first public speech in April, he openly acknowledged the economic hardship in North Korea, and pledged to raise the standard of living.The young leader, who is the third-generation of his family to lead North Korea since his grandfather founded the communist state in 1948, has already has made some significant changes. He dismissed his father's army chief and promoted a younger general. He has also been presenting a much more accessible public persona, appearing among the masses with his wife and giving televised speeches, something his father shunned during his time in power.However, North Korea has maintained its confrontational stance toward much of the outside world, especially wartime enemies South Korea and the United States. Pyongyang continues to build and develop its nuclear program despite outside pressure to dismantle its atomic facilities in exchange for much-needed aid and international cooperation.North Korea has a per capita GDP of $1,800 per year, according to the U.S. State Department, far below that of its neighbors in Northeast Asia, and its rocky, mountainous terrain and history of natural disasters has long challenged the Kim regime to provide enough food for all its people.At collective farms across the country, the government doles out fuel, seeds and fertilizers, and farmers pay the government back for the supplies, said Kang Su Ik, a professor at Wonsan Agricultural University.Under the previous system, each farmer could keep 360 kilos of corn or rice a year, in addition to what they grow in their own courtyards, and the rest was turned over to the state, he said.The rules announced last month to farmers would allow them to do as they wish with any surplus after meeting their quota, including saving it for themselves, selling it at the local farmer's market or bartering it for other goods.O, who said her family expects a surplus this year, said they would likely donate it to the state anyway. Such a donation is known in North Korea as "patriotic rice."It's unclear whether the agricultural changes will be on the agenda when legislators convene Tuesday in Pyongyang for the Supreme People's Assembly. The gathering marks the parliament's second session of the year, a notable departure from the once-a-year meetings held during Kim Jong Il's rule.The Presidium of the parliament did not announce an agenda, but Kim Song Chon, a Presidium official, told AP that legislators have been summoned to discuss domestic and foreign policy and to make personnel changes at top state bodies.______Follow AP's Korea bureau chief Jean H.

Q. Khan in 1975 and used his business in the eastern city of St. Gallen to sell centrifuge parts for enriching uranium, the online edition of Swiss tabloid Blick reported.The court also heard that Urs Tinner set up production sites in Dubai and Malaysia for producing centrifuge parts for enriching uranium, while Marco took care of supplies and book-keeping.Swiss authorities started investigating Marco Tinner and his brother in 2004, confiscating thousands of documents. A year later they expanded investigations to include Friedrich Tinner.In 2009 Urs Tinner said that he had helped the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to uncover Libya's nuclear weapons programme by tipping it off that Libya was about to receive the equipment needed to make an atom bomb.It was widely reported in the Swiss media that further investigations into the Tinners were halted after the CIA urged the Swiss government to drop them to avoid exposing the extent of the agency's activities.Switzerland, which is not a nuclear power, is not authorized under the global Non-Proliferation Treaty to possess documents related to nuclear weaponry.

Camps are overflowing with people and with bitterness, and refugees are living in limbo without passports.As war rages in Syria, the stream of refugees into other countries shows no sign of stopping. More than 100,000 people fled Syria in August alone — about 40 percent of all who had left since the uprising against President Bashar Assad began last March. And the United Nations refugee agency said Thursday that the number of people escaping Syria could reach 700,000 by the end of the year.Here, AP reporters tell the stories of refugees and their families from four countries.__________________________TRIPOLI, Lebanon — Hasna Um Abdou lost her children, her husband and both legs to a mortar.Now the veiled 38-year-old woman lies in a hospital bed in this northern Lebanese city, with the Quran, the Muslim holy book, on her table. She talks slowly, with pauses, and is visibly trying to hold back the tears. Abdul-Aziz, 3, and Talin, 13 months, were her only children."Every time I remember, I feel the pain," she says.Um Abdou is one of thousands of Syrians who have been wounded in the uprising against Assad and its aftermath. Hundreds of the wounded have been taken for treatment in neighboring countries, mostly to Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. More than 74,000 Syrians have taken refuge in Lebanon, itself a small country of just 4 million people that is struggling with instability.Um Abdou and her family fled their village in Homs province in March amid intense shelling, to a second village and then a third. Two days later, it seemed quiet, and they decided to return home. The family rode back on March 31 on a motorcycle, with Um Abdou's daughter asleep in her arms and her son sitting in front of his father.Then her world fell apart.Um Abdou keeps hearing the sound not of the mortar, but of the terror."I cannot forget the noise of the hearts beating quickly as people gathered around us," she says.Her daughter died immediately from a shrapnel wound in the head. Her son bled profusely and died minutes later, even as she looked at him. She did not want her husband to know the children were dead, so she said nothing and started to pray.But her husband was severely injured too -- the shrapnel had blown out his intestines. And Um Abdou looked down to find her own legs hanging slightly from her body."The moment I saw myself, I knew that my legs were going to be amputated," she says.She and her husband were rushed to makeshift hospitals in the Syrian border towns of Qusair and Jousi. With the help of Syrian rebels, she was carried on a stretcher all the way across the border to Lebanon, amid 12 hours of shelling and shooting. Her husband died en route.Um Abdou's children are now buried in a plot of land in Syria owned by the state. Her husband was buried in the cemetery in Jousi because it was too dangerous to take him back to his hometown."Even the dead have no right to be buried," she says.Um Abdou has undergone four operations in Lebanon, including the two amputations. Her parents and sisters are looking after her, and she displays the green, red, white and black flag of the Syrian revolution in her room.She knows the pain will be unbearable the day she goes back to Syria and visits the place where her family is buried. In the meantime, she has written a poem in the hospital."I lost my children and husband, but my soul is still strong," it reads. "I will keep saying until my last breath, long live freedom."___________________BAGHDAD, Iraq — The gang of masked gunmen broke into the small apartment near Damascus where Waleed Mohammed Abdul-Wahid and his family had lived for nearly three years. "Are you Sunni or Shiite?" they shouted, as his three children began to cry."We are Sunnis!" answered his wife, Wasan Malouki Khalaf."Do you know any Shiites who are cooperating with the Syrian government?" the gunmen demanded."We do not know any such people," she said. "We are from Baghdad."The gunmen left. The brief but terrifying invasion sealed the decision Abdul-Wahid had been mulling for weeks: to leave behind an increasingly violent life in Syria and return to Iraq.More than 2, 200,000 people fled Iraq during the war and sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and almost half of them ended up in neighboring Syria. Now Syria is plagued with the same sectarian conflict, and many of the same people are on the run a second time. At least 22,000 Iraqi refugees are thought to have left Syria to return to Iraq, despite the dangers they thought they had left behind.Abdul-Wahid had worked as a deliveryman back in Baghdad, bringing cylinders of cooking gas to both Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods. Militants kidnapped him outside his Sunni-dominated neighborhood of Azimiyah in 2009 and tortured him for four days. His arms still show the burn scars.The family packed up and fled to Syria, where they built a new life in a mostly Shiite suburb. The children settled down in school, and the United Nations gave them food and an income. Abdul-Wahid, 49, found a job in construction and started taking medication for the severe depression he had suffered after the kidnapping.Then the uprising against Assad began, and violence returned to Abdul-Wahid's life. Mortars bombarded their neighborhood, and snipers shot at people in the streets. The last straw was the gunmen storming their home in late July, and asking his daughter if she was Sunni or Shiite."She did not reply, because she does not know the meaning of such a question," Abdul-Wahid says.The bus fare from Damascus to Baghdad cost about $110 for each person. Abdul-Wahid had to ask his brother for money, he says, his eyes filling up with tears of sadness and shame. His family is living in a room in his brother's house."I have lost everything now," he says. "I am jobless and penniless...I am even afraid of going outside my brother's house. Now, I have to start from zero."He plans to go back to Syria when — or if — the violence ebbs. Wasan, his wife, says the shortages of electricity and water in Iraq are unbearable, as is the lack of good medical care, security and jobs.But Abdul-Wahid is doubtful the violence will end any time soon, or Assad will be ousted from power."I think that the armed struggle in Syria will continue for a long time," he says. "He is clinging to power...I think that he will survive."__________________ZAATARI, Jordan — At this Syrian refugee camp opened in the desert just two months ago, anger sizzles in the scorching sun.It is anger at being crowded with about 32,000 other people onto a parched, treeless strip of land, where the day is too hot and the night is too cold. But it is also a murderous anger among the Sunni Muslims here against the Shiites back home, whom they blame for the war. Many Sunnis oppose Assad's ruling regime, which is Alawite, an offshoot of Shiite Islam."When I return, I will kill any Shiite I see with my dagger. I will chop him to pieces," shouts Basel Baradan, a bitter 18-year-old farmer who fled the southern town of Daraa with his family in July. He is weeping.Jordan now hosts an estimated 200,000 Syrians, including those not registered with the U.N. -- the largest number of refugees taken in by any neighboring country. After months of delay, Jordan finally opened its first official refugee camp in July at Zaatari, near the border with Syria.Already, about 30,000 refugees live at the camp, and they keep coming. This poor desert nation says it can no longer afford to welcome Syrian refugees into its towns and houses.So they live apart at Zaatari, and they grow angrier. Late Monday, dozens of furious refugees hurled stones and injured about 26 Jordanian policemen, demanding better camp conditions or their return home.Baradan's father Ghassan, 50, also a farmer, says that with the ubiquitous dust, snakes, scorpions and swings in temperature, living at Zaatari is a "worse struggle than Assad's missiles falling on our heads back home." He too is angry, and blames Shiites under Assad for killing Sunnis.Baradan lived most of his life exchanging visits and sharing meals with Shiite neighbors. But he grew increasingly resentful in recent years because he thought the Shiites were getting more food and money, and were supported by Iran, a Shiite Muslim nation."Sunni Muslims have no respect in Syria and we fled here to find ourselves confined to this dirty prison," he sighs, puffing on his cigarette under a once-white tent, yellowed from the desert sun and heat.The thirst for revenge that is palpable at the Zaatari camp does not bode well for Syria's future.Baradan's tent is marked with the Arabic scribbling "Get out, Assad." Outside, a group of young Syrians lines up to fill buckets with drinking water. One of them, Mohammad Sweidan, 17, wears a green T-shirt with an Arabic emblem that reads: "Proud Sunni.""Shiites and Alawites are not Muslims," he says. "They should be killed because they are infidels, who are killing the Sunnis, the true believers and followers of Islam."Under Baradan's tent, his 46-year-old wife says she worries about ending up stateless, like Palestinian refugees displaced in wars with Israel. She cries as she cooks lunch on a small gas stove."I never thought we would become refugees like them," says the woman, who calls herself Um Basel after her eldest son, in keeping with conservative Muslim tradition. Her husband interrupts. "Even the Israelis do not treat the Palestinians the way Assad is treating Sunnis in Syria."In a corner, Basel too is crying as he gazes at video on his cellphone of his 9-month-old nephew, Rabee, left behind in Daraa with his family."What is keeping me going is this video," he says, tearfully. "I can't wait to see Rabee again. I miss him dearly."_____________________CAIRO, Egypt — Syrian refugee Mohammad B.'s passport expired a few weeks ago, making official what he has long known: He no longer has a country.The 26-year-old had nowhere to renew his passport. The Syrian embassy in Cairo was closed after protests. The embassies in Libya and Tunisia had switched loyalty to the opposition and could no longer issue passports. And the embassy in Algeria simply told him to go back to Syria.That was not an option.In Syria, Mohammad had been studying to become an English teacher. He fled in May 2011 after he was shot in Daraa, the birthplace of the uprising. The bullet pierced his upper lip, broke his teeth, ripped through his cheekbone and exited near his temple. The deep, jagged wound identified him as an anti-government protester, which in Syria marked him for death.At first all the protesters wanted was a new mayor and better amenities. Mohammad was hopeful."I didn't want to leave my country, I wanted it to get better," says the soft spoken young man with a ponytail and a right eye that droops slightly from his wound. He uses only his first name because he fears for the safety of his parents, both government employees in Daraa.On April 25, the military clamped off the main road into Daraa. Then, he says, security forces started firing into the crowd of about 50 people with large machine guns.A bullet sliced Mohammad's lip. He waved his hands for help, and a car came to his aid. A cellphone video he was shooting at the time, seen by The Associated Press, records the sound of a hail of bullets popping off the metal."It was very painful," Mohammad recalls. "I thought: Today is my last day....And the driver thought I was dead."When he got home, his family fled to hide with relatives in the countryside. He stayed in bed for a week, unable to eat. Then he made the most difficult decision of his life: He had to leave Syria immediately.He had never left Syria before. He chose Egypt because he would not need a visa, and knew a friend there.Egypt does not share a border with Syria, and only about 1,700 Syrian refugees have registered there, according to the United Nations' refugee agency. However, the agency estimates the real number is closer to 95,000.Mohammad's family gave him about $1,000 in cash, all they could spare. He put on dark sunglasses, wrapped a headdress over his face and prayed all the way to the airport. The bus passed a gauntlet of 25 checkpoints.At the airport, he was detained for questioning but slipped interrogators a $300 bribe. He headed for his plane, sure he would be back.Instead he is still in Cairo, with no money. He lives in a rundown apartment where eight people share three rooms.With the help of a German-based aid group, Mohammad has had four operations for his face. His doctor says he will need more.In February, one of Mohammad's five brothers made his way to Egypt, via Jordan. Bashar, 21, suffers from psychological problems after being shut in the house for a year watching the violence on TV. His presence both helps and hurts Mohammad."I feel like I have a family, but on the other hand, it made my life more difficult," Mohammad said. "He doesn't work."Mohammad cannot legally work or study either. But he is teaching Arabic and translating for journalists. He also is considering starting a Web-based service to collect videos, photos and other documentation of the rebellion from citizens back home.He talks with his family in Syria most days by phone or Skype. They never discuss politics. Since he left, security forces have gone to his house twice looking for him."I am worried all the time about my family and friends," he says. "When I check on them, I just want to know they are still there."Above all, Mohammad longs to go home, study and have a good career. None of that is possible while he is stranded in Egypt with an expired passport."I just want to stop this bloodbath," he says. "I don't know how."Mroue reported from Tripoli, Lebanon; Yacoub and Jakes from Baghdad, Iraq; Marjorie Olster from Cairo, Egypt; and Jamal Halaby from Zaatari, Jordan.	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4	3	4	3	2	5	5	4
580	syrian-warplanes-bomb-aleppo-kill-3-children-115911243	BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian warplanes bombed two buildings on Monday in the northern city of Aleppo, killing at least five people including three children from the same family, activists said.The Britain-based activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll could very well rise with more people feared to be buried under the rubble of the two destroyed buildings.Aleppo-based activist said Mohammed Saeed said the raid came before dawn. He added that the aim behind such strikes on residential areas is to "terrify the people and try to turn them against the Free Syrian Army rebel group."The regime wants people to say that had the Free Syrian Army not entered the city, the regime wouldn't have bombed us," Saeed said.The fight for Aleppo, a city of 3 million that was once a bastion of support for President Bashar Assad, began in late July and is critical for both the regime and the opposition. If it falls to the opposition, it would be a major strategic victory in the civil war, giving fighters a stronghold in the north near the Turkish border. A rebel defeat, at the very least, would buy Assad more time.Activists say nearly 30,000 people have already died in the uprising against Assad's rule that began 18 months ago, inspired by the other revolts around the Arab world against authoritarian rulers.The Observatory the Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, said the airstrikes on the southern neighborhood of Maadi destroyed the targeted buildings. An amateur video showed people digging through a pile of rubble in search of survivors.Fighting and shelling have been a daily occurrence in Aleppo, Syria's largest city and commercial capital, since late July when rebels attacked it and took over several neighborhoods. Repeated attacks by government troops to regain control of the areas have so far been unsuccessful.The battle for Aleppo has marked the first time that the regime has used helicopters and warplanes regularly to strike from the air, bringing an even heavier toll of civilian casualties than before when military forces relied heavily on often indiscriminate artillery and tank shelling.The Observatory said five people were killed in the latest airstrikes while the LCC said eight died. The LCC said the dead included three children from the same family. Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Observatory, said the death toll could rise with more people feared buried under the rubble.The Observatory and the LCC reported violence elsewhere in the country including attacks by government troops backed by helicopter gunships on the southern town of Sheikh Miskeen in Daraa province.The Observatory said rebels and troops were fighting near the military air base of Tabaqah in the northern province of Raqqa. Last week, rebels captured a major border crossing with Turkey in Raqqa.The latest attacks came as the U.N.'s top human rights body prepared to vote on a resolution next week that would condemn abuses in Syria, call for perpetrators to be held accountable and extend the mission of a U.N. expert panel which has been collecting evidence of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity.The draft resolution was submitted to the U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday by Arab countries including Morocco, Jordan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Kuwait. It is likely to receive a majority in the 47-nation council when it goes to a vote at the end of next week.The Geneva-based council received a report earlier this month from the Commission of Inquiry it appointed to investigate abuses in Syria. The panel reported that an increasing number of 'foreign elements,' including Islamic militants, are now operating in Syria. The panel also submitted a confidential list of Syrian officials who it said could be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity.___Associated Press writer Frank Jordans contributed to this report from Berlin.	4	3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	4	2	2	4	3	
581	tablets-turtles-most-wanted-holiday-toy-list-143417714--finance	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tablet computers, turtles and a new take on a furry old-timer are the hot toys retailers and manufacturers hope will spark a rebound from a dismal 2011 holiday season, according to a closely watched "Most Wanted" list released on Friday.The industry is not just counting on best-selling toys to generate joy at the cash register. Major retailers are pushing more attractive layaway plans to lure shoppers into stores before they go elsewhere this holiday season.Competition will be stiff over layaway: who's the earliest, with no fee or just a small fee."This year (there) is going to be more action early, and it's the battle of the layaway programs," said Jim Silver, editor in chief of TimetoPlay.com, which released its "Most Wanted List" of toys on Friday."Everybody is being super aggressive, announcing the hot items, saying 'come get it on layaway.'"Walmart U.S., Wal-Mart's largest unit, brought layaway back a month early this year - giving shoppers who live paycheck-to-paycheck more time to pay for holiday gifts.Toys R Us Inc offered layaway with no upfront fee, and soon after, Walmart cut its upfront fee to $5 from $15. The $5 fee will be returned in the form of a Walmart gift card if all payments are completed on time - as the $15 fee would have been.Last year, Wal-Mart Stores Inc used the layaway strategy successfully to boost sales, taking customers away from the likes of Toys R Us.Among this year's hot toys is LeapFrog Enterprises Inc's $99.99 LeapPad 2 Explorer tablet, an update on last year's massive holiday hit.The tablet made Time to Play's Holiday 2012 Most Wanted List, which is a hot read for toy industry executives. It was also featured on The Toy Insider, a holiday gift guide from a publisher that serves the toy and licensing industries, as well as gift lists from Walmart, Toys R Us and Sears Holdings Corp's Kmart.Time to Play's list includes returning old classics like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figures; a princess wedding castle playset for Hasbro Inc's My Little Pony; Lego Friends; and an update of Hasbro's furry 1990s toy, Furby.Newer characters like Just Play's Doc McStuffins could be a hit. The doll based on the Disney Junior show has landed on lists from Time to Play, Toys R Us and Toy Insider."The consumer looks for value," Time to Play's Silver said. "Parents look for things that a child will play with over and over."Other items on the list include Thomas & Friends's Steam and Speed remote control by Mattel unit Fisher-Price, and Winx Club Everyday Concert Collections by Jakks Pacific Inc.Hasbro is looking for a better holiday season this year than the one last year, when demand weakened after Thanksgiving.Larger rival Mattel saw international sales at holiday time hurt by a stronger dollar.At stores, shoppers will have options other than layaway.Toys R Us has introduced a program this year that lets shoppers reserve any 50 toys on a list it will draw up by making a 20 percent down payment in person at its stores by October 31.Dollar General Corp said Thursday it is offering a 10 percent discount on purchases of at least $75 from its toy selection, which includes items by Mattel, Hasbro and Walt Disney Co.(Reporting by Phil Wahba in New York; Editing by Brad Dorfman and Jeffrey Benkoe)	3	3	2	3	4	3	3	4	3	2	3	2	3	2	3	
582	taliban-release-video-afghan-attackers-120700838	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban have released a video they say shows insurgents preparing for an attack on a NATO base earlier this month that killed two Marines and destroyed six fighter jets.The footage released on Monday shows men wearing U.S. Army uniforms as they practice cutting through a chain-link fence and charging through the opening. One man indicates targets with a pointer and a whiteboard with drawings of planes.He speaks Pashtun, a major language in southern Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan. Words on the whiteboard are written in Urdu, a language more common in Pakistan.A Taliban spokesman emailed the link to the video to the media but it was not possible to verify the authenticity of the footage.

583	tamer-job-gains-expected-canada-september-183508574--business	TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada is likely to have added a modest 10,000 new jobs in September, backpedaling from gains in August that far surpassed market expectations and better reflecting the sluggish pace of the country's economic growth.The gain of 10,000 jobs was the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 23 economists. The most bullish forecast was for 28,000 new jobs and the most bearish was for a loss of 15,000 jobs.In August, Canada added 34,300 jobs - more than doubling expectations and recouping all the 30,400 positions lost in July - but analysts see slower and steadier jobs growth as more in line with economic fundamentals."If we look at the last six months, even the six-month average, which is about 27,000, that looks high for an economy that's growing at less than 2 percent," said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC, who expects 10,000 new jobs."So we're due for a somewhat slower pace."The poll's median forecast for the unemployment rate in September was 7.3 percent, unchanged from August and July.Jobs growth was muted in May and June after a whopping 140,500 new jobs were created in March and April, which was the biggest two-month spree of job creation in more than 30 years."We expect a see-saw performance from the labor market in September as another strong gain in jobs (like that in August) is not likely given the current economic environment," IHS Global Insight Canadian economists Arlene Kish and Jillian Kohut wrote in a research note.They forecast a loss of 15,000 jobs, but added: "There is the potential for a gain given that consumer confidence levels increased in September, but we haven't always seen survey responses reflected in actual data outcomes."Canada has regained all the jobs it lost during the last recession, which was milder in Canada than it was in the United States.(Editing by Peter Galloway and Jeffrey Hodgson)	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	1	2	1	1	1	3	4
584	team-obama-getting-overconfident-070900581--election	It's safe to say that the Democrats are pretty happy with where things stand in the presidential race, and that President Obama would rather be in his own electoral shoes than Republican challenger Mitt Romney's. With a short six weeks left until the election, Romney's campaign is struggling to reboot after a disastrous few weeks, Obama holds a slim but steady lead in most national polls, his electoral-college advantage is even more formidable, and as New York Times stats whiz Nate Silver points out, history is in Obama's corner at this point in the race. Some Democrats are even declaring victory — "Mitt Romney's not going to be president of the United States," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sept. 16. "I think everybody knows that." Yikes! says Matt Miller at The Washington Post. Yes, Romney's had a "week from hell," but "it's far too early for Democrats to pop open the champagne." Are Obama and his surrogates getting a little overconfident?Team Obama has every reason to be confident: Could anything still happen in this race? Sure, says Nate Cohn at The New Republic, but it's getting harder to think up plausible scenarios in which Romney wins. A strong challenger might "mount an unprecedented comeback against an incumbent," but combine Romney's notable weakness as a candidate, Obama's just-under-50-percent poll numbers, and the fact that almost all voters have made up their minds, and "a Romney victory just doesn't seem like it's in the cards.""Romney's chances are in jeopardy"SEE MORE: Is beer Obama's secret campaign weapon?Actually, Chicago is terrified of complacency: None of that matters if Obama voters "take his apparent advantages for granted — and fail to show up on Election Day," says Amy Gardner at The Washington Post. That's the scenario that keeps Obama's campaign chiefs up at night. Complacency is "a special threat" to Obama because his election strategy relies on a vast field operation, so if his politically attuned staffers believe the "torrent of media coverage" suggesting Romney is toast, there goes Obama's voter-registration and get-out-the-vote advantage."Obama campaign redoubling efforts amid fears of voter complacency"One candidate is cocky, but it's not Obama: "Republicans were — and are — right to see this as a winnable election," says Jamelle Bouie at The American Prospect, but "I'm increasingly convinced that the Romney campaign is beset by a clueless overconfidence." How else to account for Romney's failure to move toward the center, and his passive faith that a weak economy is enough to beat an incumbent president, except that he's bought into the Right's fantasy that Obama is "a lightweight and weakling." Obama is hardly a perfect president, but opponents forget that he's a tough, "ruthless campaigner" at their own peril."How can Romney bounce back?"SEE MORE: 3 ways the Chicago teachers' strike hurts ObamaRead more political coverage at The Week's 2012 Election Center.View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	4	4	3	3	4	3	2	3	3	1	3	3	1	1	3	4

A bullet struck Young in his eye.Police said Myers admitted to shooting Young, and told responders on the scene the shooting was an accident. Myers said he thought he had loaded the gun with dummy rounds, according to police.The soldiers had been drinking, police said.Young later died in an ambulance, according to Killeen Police spokesperson Carroll Smith. She said the investigation into the shooting was ongoing.Myers was charged with manslaughter and is being held on $1 million bond.(Editing by Paul Thomasch and Vicki Allen)	3	3	2	4	3	4	2	3	4	2	4	1	1	3	3	3

588	theory-why-men-love-breasts-223029914	Why do straight men devote so much headspace to those big, bulbous bags of fat drooping from women's chests? Scientists have never satisfactorily explained men's curious breast fixation, but now, a neuroscientist has struck upon an explanation that he says "just makes a lot of sense."Larry Young, a professor of psychiatry at Emory University who studies the neurological basis of complex social behaviors, thinks human evolution has harnessed an ancient neural circuit that originally evolved to strengthen the mother-infant bond during breast-feeding, and now uses this brain circuitry to strengthen the bond between couples as well. The result? Men, like babies, love breasts.When a woman's nipples are stimulated during breast-feeding, the neurochemical oxytocin, otherwise known as the "love drug," floods her brain, helping to focus her attention and affection on her baby. But research over the past few years has shown that in humans, this circuitry isn't reserved for exclusive use by infants.Recent studies have found that nipple stimulation enhances sexual arousal in the great majority of women, and it activates the same brain areas as vaginal and clitoral stimulation. When a sexual partner touches, massages or nibbles a woman's breasts, Young said, this triggers the release of oxytocin in the woman's brain, just like what happens when a baby nurses. But in this context, the oxytocin focuses the woman's attention on her sexual partner, strengthening her desire to bond.In other words, men can make themselves more desirable by stimulating a woman's breasts during foreplay and sex. Evolution has, in a sense, made men want to do this.Attraction to breasts "is a brain organization effect that occurs in straight males when they go through puberty," Young told Life's Little Mysteries. "Evolution has selected for this brain organization in men that makes them attracted to the breasts in a sexual context, because the outcome is that it activates the female bonding circuit, making women feel more bonded with him. It's a behavior that males have evolved in order to stimulate the female's maternal bonding circuitry." [Why Do Men Have Nipples?]So, why did this evolutionary change happen in humans, and not in other breast-feeding mammals? Young thinks it's because we form monogamous relationships, whereas 97 percent of mammals do not. "Secondly, it might have to do with the fact that we are upright and have face-to-face sex, which provides more opportunity for nipple stimulation during sex. In monogamous voles, for example, the nipples are hanging toward the ground and the voles mate from behind, so this didn't evolve," he said. "So, maybe the nature of our sexuality has allowed greater access to the breasts."Young said competing theories of men's breast fixation don't stand up to scrutiny. For example, the argument that men tend to select full-breasted women because they think these women's breast fat will make them better at nourishing babies falls short when one considers that "sperm is cheap" compared with eggs, and men don't need to be choosy.But Young's new theory will face scrutiny of its own. Commenting on the theory, Rutgers University anthropologist Fran Mascia-Lees, who has written extensively about the evolutionary role of breasts, said one concern is that not all men are attracted to them. "Always important whenever evolutionary biologists suggest a universal reason for a behavior and emotion: how about the cultural differences?" Mascia-Lees wrote in an email. In some African cultures, for example, women don't cover their breasts, and men don't seem to find them so, shall we say, titillating.Young says that just because breasts aren't covered in these cultures "doesn't mean that massaging them and stimulating them is not part of the foreplay in these cultures. As of yet, there are not very many studies that look at [breast stimulation during foreplay] in an anthropological context," he said.Young elaborates on his theory of breast love, and other neurological aspects of human sexuality, in a new book, "The Chemistry Between Us" (Current Hardcover, 2012), co-authored by Brian Alexander.Follow Natalie Wolchover on Twitter @nattyover or Life's Little Mysteries @llmysteries.

589	tigers-nationals-clinch-nl-east-095854709--mlb	Here's how the pennant races look with two days to go:— FIVE ALIVE: A muddled mess only days ago, the American League playoff picture is clearing up quickly. All five spots are secured: New York, Baltimore, Detroit, Texas and Oakland are in. The Tigers won the AL Central on Monday night with a 6-3 victory in Kansas City and will open the postseason at home Saturday. The other two division titles remain up for grabs.— COAST TO COAST: The Yankees routed rival Boston 10-2 to take a one-game lead in the AL East over the Orioles, who lost 5-3 at Tampa Bay. New York can wrap up its 13th division championship in 17 years with a victory Tuesday night and another Baltimore loss. ... Oakland beat Texas 4-3 to lock up its first playoff berth in six years and pull within one game of the first-place Rangers in the AL West. The upstart A's need a series sweep to steal the division title, while Texas must win just once to claim its third straight crown.— BEASTS OF THE EAST: Washington wrapped up the NL East title when second-place Atlanta lost 2-1 in Pittsburgh. Despite a 2-0 defeat to Philadelphia at home, the Nationals sprayed booze and threw quite a victory party after clinching their first division championship since moving to the nation's capital from Montreal in 2005.

590	tom-delay-still-waiting-learn-legal-fate-181447168	HOUSTON (AP) — Former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay — still waiting to learn his legal fate since being convicted nearly two years ago for his role in a scheme to influence Texas elections — is praying for vindication but also preparing for the possibility of imprisonment.DeLay's three-year prison sentence has been on hold as his case has made its way through the appellate process. For both DeLay and his critics, the process has been frustratingly slow, due in part to some of the appeals court justices in Austin recusing themselves as well as DeLay's successful effort to have a judge on the panel removed because of anti-Republican comments she made."I don't like living under this cloud. But I'm not angry about it. I even pray for the prosecution and my enemies," the former Houston-area congressman told The Associated Press in an interview. "No, they have not destroyed Tom DeLay as a person. And I'm ready to go to prison if that's where I'm supposed to end up."But DeLay, and his attorney, Brian Wice, are hoping to get his convictions overturned. On Oct. 10, they will finally get a chance to make their case to the 3rd Court of Appeals, arguing the once-powerful Republican leader did nothing wrong and is the victim of a political vendetta, a claim that prosecutors deny.DeLay, 65, was found guilty in November 2010 of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering for helping illegally funnel corporate money to Texas candidates in 2002.Sitting with DeLay in his office in downtown Houston on Wednesday, Wice used a literary allusion to explain the case. He compared DeLay to Jean Valjean, the kind-hearted protagonist of Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables." He called Ronnie Earle, the now-retired Democratic Travis County District Attorney in Austin who charged the former lawmaker, a modern-day Inspector Javert, who pursued Valjean at all costs.The Travis County District Attorney's Office says the case was never about politics but about someone who broke Texas law."Our office has always been fair and never been politically motivated in prosecuting this defendant or any other," said prosecutor Holly Taylor.Jurors in Austin determined DeLay conspired with two associates, John Colyandro and Jim Ellis, to use his Texas-based political action committee to send a check for $190,000 in corporate money to an arm of the Washington-based Republican National Committee. The RNC then sent the same amount to seven Texas House candidates. Under state law, corporate money cannot be given directly to political campaigns.Prosecutors claim the money helped the GOP take control of the Texas House, enabling them to push through a DeLay-engineered congressional redistricting plan that sent more Republicans to Congress in 2004, strengthening his political power.A judge in January 2011 sentenced DeLay to three years in prison but allowed him to remain free on bond pending his appeal. In June, Ellis was sentenced to four years' probation. Colyandro awaits trial.DeLay, who once held the No. 2 job in the House of Representatives, said he has been "unemployable" since his conviction and is living off Social Security and his $60,000 annual pension.He has kept himself busy with speaking engagements and is involved with various projects that advance the conservative cause, including a religious-based one called "40 Days to Save America." He still lives in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land, an area he represented for 22 years.DeLay said people usually recognize him from his 2009 appearance on ABC's hit television show "Dancing With the Stars.""They have never given me a hard time for being a convicted felon," he said.DeLay and his attorney continue to contend money laundering did not occur because no illegal funds were funneled through the RNC.Wice also said he'll tell the appeals court no crime occurred because in 2002 money laundering in Texas only applied to funds in the form of cash and not checks. The state law was later changed to also specify checks."This was a situation where the prosecution couldn't sell the steak, so they sold the sizzle," Wice said.Taylor called Wice's claim "rather absurd." She said DeLay's belief that his case was politically motivated is just a way to "try and explain away this legitimate prosecution."While the various changes to the appeals court has resulted in a three-judge panel of two Republicans and one Democrat to hear DeLay's case, Wice said it won't give the ex-lawmaker an advantage.Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said there is some irony in DeLay — whose tough political tactics earned him the nickname "the Hammer" — claiming he is the victim of partisanship."If there is any irony here, it will be lost on Tom DeLay because when he looks out through his eyeballs he sees a partisan world," Jillson said. "He sees everyone motivated the way he was motivated."But DeLay says he is not claiming to be a victim, adding his faith in Jesus Christ has helped him through this difficult time."I am totally at peace and I'm full of joy ... I'm not beaten down," he said.The state appeals court probably won't be the last stop, as the losing side will likely take the case to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Ultimately, the case could wind up in the U.S. Supreme Court."It's frustrating to wait so long to get justice in a case like this," said Craig McDonald, the director of Texans for Public Justice, a liberal watchdog group whose complaints helped lead to the investigation of DeLay's PAC."I'd be surprised if he ever saw the inside of the big house," McDonald said.___Follow Juan A.

591	tom-rothman-join-steven-spielberg-robopocalypse-193713462	LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Countering recent rumors that Steven Spielberg may not even direct "Robopocalypse," DreamWorks issued a press release Monday saying that Spielberg would direct and produce the movie and that Tom Rothman is coming on board also as a producer.The film, a DreamWorks and Twentieth Century Fox co-production, will begin principal photography in early 2013 and will be released on April 25, 2014 worldwide. The Walt Disney Studio's Touchstone Pictures will distribute the film domestically with Twentieth Century Fox handling international distribution.Exploring the fate of the human race following a robot uprising, "Robopocalypse" is being adapted for the screen by Drew Goddard and is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel H. Wilson. DreamWorks acquired the rights to Wilson's unpublished manuscript in November 2009. Published by Doubleday on June 8, 2011, the book soon appeared on the New York Times best-sellers' list."When someone like Tom is a free agent, you snatch him up fast," Spielberg said in a statement. "He has proven himself to be a necessity of this industry. At Fox he had already been an enthusiastic partner on ‘Robopocalypse,' and it is to our advantage that he would come produce this film with me."Rothman recently resigned after 18 years at Twentieth Century Fox, the last 12 as Chairman and CEO."If you are in politics, you dream of a call from the White House, in baseball, from the Yankees, in movies, from Steven Spielberg," Rothman said in a statement. "'Robopocalypse' is the kind of important epic entertainment, a big movie with big ideas, that Steven does better than any filmmaker on earth ... I enjoyed the idea of being unemployed for a week, but this will be way more fun."Meanwhile, CAA could not confirm reports that Anne Hathaway is circling the project.	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	1	3	1	1	1	3	4

593	top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249	On Oct. 14, pieces of asteroids, the moon and Mars that have landed on Earth go up for sale in a public auction in Manhattan.These meteorites may have originated in space, but many create tantalizing tales — or hint at future calamity — when they collide with Earth. From the more than 125 meteorite pieces and related material going up for sale at Heritage Auctions, here are five with the strangest space-rock stories.The only known fatalityOn the evening of Oct. 15, 1972, farmhands in Trujillo, Venezuela, heard a sonic boom. The next morning, a large rock was found alongside a dead cow with a crushed neck and clavicle. Years later, scientists confirmed the rock, which in the meantime had served as a doorstop, was a meteorite, according to the catalog description of New York City's Heritage Auctions for a partial slice of the Valera meteorite. [See Photos of Meteorites for Sale]This is the only known meteorite responsible for a fatality, at least to date."It is going to happen, and it's going to be a very sad day. It is inevitable that people will be killed by a meteorite," said Darryl Pitt, the meteorite consultant for the auction. He added that when he speaks to children, this is the first thing they ask about. He said he tells them to "worry about the things they have control over."The only asteroid tracked to EarthThe potential for a devastating impact from an asteroid or comet is real, and astronomers are keeping an eye out for this type of threat.On Oct. 6, 2008, Richard Kowalski, at the Catalina Sky Survey, spotted a new asteroid, dubbed 2008 TC3, on a collision course with Earth. For the first time, astronomers around the world tracked the asteroid's approach for the day before it hit Earth. The asteroid exploded upon entering Earth's atmosphere, and as predicted, it fell in the Nubian Desert of Northern Sudan, where 35 pounds (15.9 kilograms) of meteorites were eventually found.Much of its mass is believed to have been vaporized or to have disintegrated when it hit Earth's atmosphere. It was renamed Almahata Sitta, Arabic for "station six," a railroad stop on the line to Khartoum near where the meteorites were found, according to the auction catalog description. [Top 10 Ways to Destroy Earth]An 'accident' with a ChevyAlmost 20 years ago, on Oct. 9, 1992, video cameras at Friday night football games in the northeastern United States caught the fiery descent of a meteorite that would end its fall by punching through the trunk of a red Chevy Malibu parked in Peekskill, N.Y. The owner of the car, 18-year-old Michelle Knapp, sold the car within a week for 25 times the $400 she paid for it when buying it from her grandmother, according to the catalog.Not only are two pieces of this meteorite for sale, collectors also have a chance to purchase the original title to the Malibu and the bulb from the rear tail light, which exploded when the car's trunk was punctured by the meteorite.Chained to EarthIn 1492, a stone fell from the sky outside the walled city of Ensisheim, located in the Alsatian region of France, preceded by "a great thunder clap, then a long noise that was heard far around," the auction catalog quotes a 16th-century document. The stone's descent was seen as a sign from God; the extraterrestrial origin of meteorites would not be accepted for another 300 years. The Ensisheim meteorite was brought into the city and chained up in church to keep it Earth-bound. It is Europe's oldest preserved meteorite.Hopes for a cureOn Aug. 14, 1992, residents of the Nigerian city of Mbale heard a loud explosion that became a rumbling, accompanied by a white smoke trail in the sky. Then rocks rained down, pelting an area of about 1.9 by 4.3 miles (3 by 7 kilometers). One small meteorite even struck a young boy after ricocheting off a banana tree. Because the region was being ravaged by AIDS, Mbale residents believed the meteorite shower brought a cure from God, and they ground up the stones into a paste that was eaten or applied topically, the auction catalog recounts.Within several months, 426 stones weighting 238 pounds (108 kilograms) had been recovered from this large meteorite shower.The auction, held by Heritage Auctions, is scheduled to take place on Sunday, Oct. 14, at the Fletcher-Sinclair Mansion at 2 East 79th Street in Manhattan.Follow LiveScienceon Twitter@livescience.

595	toys-r-us-sued-over-kids-tablet-trade-192743248--finance	(Reuters) - The maker of the Nabi tablet computer for children sued Toys R Us Inc on Monday, saying the world's largest toy retailer stole trade secrets in preparing to introduce the rival Tabeo tablet this month.The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Diego, California, seeks to stop Toys R Us from selling Tabeo ahead of the all-important holiday season. Nabi creator Fuhu Inc contends that Toys R Us agreed to become the exclusive seller of the Nabi last year to learn product secrets before bringing Tabeo to market.The introduction of Tabeo heated up the market for tablets designed specifically for children, which also includes players like LeapFrog Enterprises Inc's LeapPad.Fuhu accused Toys R Us of fraud, breach of contract, unfair competition and trade secret misappropriation. Fuhu also said that Toys R Us copied Nabi's butterfly-shaped bumper,which is used to help protect the tablet, for Tabeo.According to the lawsuit, Toys R Us agreed in October 2011 to become the exclusive Nabi distributor, but in the end did "virtually no promotion" and only ordered for the holiday season a little more than what Toys R Us said could be sold in one day.The companies ended their exclusive agreement in January.Fuhu said in the lawsuit that the reason for Toys R Us's behavior did not become clear until it introduced Tabeo this month."Toys R Us used Fuhu's trade secrets and confidential information to start selling Tabeo, which systematically attempts to replicate the Nabi experience, far earlier than Toys r Us could have done otherwise, if at all," the lawsuit said.Aside from the order to stop selling Tabeo, Fuhu is asking that any Tabeos be turned over to Fuhu. It is also seeking unspecified monetary damages.A spokeswoman for Toys R Us said the company could not comment on the lawsuit as it has yet to have an opportunity to review it.The case is Fuhu Inc v Toys "R" Us Inc, Case.

596	trader-joes-recalls-peanut-butter-235519131	WASHINGTON (AP) — The grocery store chain Trader Joe's is recalling peanut butter that has been linked to 29 salmonella illnesses in 18 states.The Food and Drug Administration and the federal Centers for Disease Control said Saturday that the store's Creamy Salted Valencia Peanut Butter, which is sold nationwide, is the likely source of the outbreak. The agencies are investigating whether any other items sold at the store could be contaminated.More than three-fourths of those who became ill were children under the age of 18. No deaths have been reported.The FDA issued a statement Saturday saying that the FDA, the CDC and the state of California briefed Trader Joe's on its investigation showing the link between the peanut butter and the illnesses on Sept. 20. The company then agreed to remove the product from store shelves.The government did not release which states had reported illnesses, but several states have issued warnings to residents not to eat the peanut butter. According to the individual states' health departments, three cases were in Massachusetts, one was in Rhode Island and one was in North Carolina.The CDC said people became sick between June 11 and Sept. 2. Information may not be available for those who were sickened after August.Salmonella can cause diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. It is most dangerous to children, the elderly and others with weak immune systems.	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	1	3	3	4
597	tullow-oil-partners-start-drilling-third-well-kenya-080600216--finance	NAIROBI (Reuters) - British explorer Tullow Oil Plc and its Canadian partner Africa Oil Corp started drilling a third well in Kenya, extending a campaign to discover more reserves after finding oil in the east African country earlier this year.Drilling of the well, known as Paipai-1 and located in northern Kenya's Marsabit County, started on Saturday. Its planned total depth is 4,112 metres and it could have as many as 121 million barrels of crude oil, Africa Oil said. Tullow hopes the well will encounter oil, rather than gas."A discovery at Paipai would extend the producing plays of Sudan into Kenya and open a potentially significant and new petroleum province within Kenya," Keith Hill, Africa Oil's chief executive, said in a statement.East Africa has become a hotbed of exploration after several petroleum discoveries in the area pushed the region into the international limelight. However, Kenya has yet to determine whether it has commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons.Paipai-1 on onshore Block 10A is a joint venture of Tullow, the well operator with 50 percent of the exploration license, Africa Oil, holding 30 percent, and London-listed Afren, with the remaining 20 percent.Tullow is already drilling one other well in Kenya, known as Twiga-1, on Block 13T, about 30 kilometres west of where it made its oil discovery in March. Hill said the results of this well are expected before the end of October.The British company also was a venture partner in the offshore well, Mbawa-1, that encountered gas. However, Mbawa's operator Apache Corp said it had hoped to find oil and there was insufficient gas to justify costly investments in liquefied natural gas facilities and pipelines.If Tullow finds oil for a second time in Kenya, it may spur investment in infrastructure projects, such as a refinery and pipeline to its coastal ports.Kenya's energy minister Kiraitu Murungi said he thought the country had enough petroleum to warrant both projects."We are becoming the new Middle East," Murungi said at a press conference in August.Tullow indicated it would be at least a year before it knows whether its March discovery can be extracted and exported.	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	1	1	1	3	4
598	turkey-pro-kurd-party-urges-talks-end-kurdish-080458368	ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The head of Turkey's main Kurdish party has called for talks between the government and Kurdish militants to prevent a further escalation of violence which she said could undermine efforts to draw up a new, more liberal constitution.More than 700 people have been killed since elections in June 2011, according to the International Crisis Group, the highest toll in a 15-month period since Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) chief Abdullah Ocalan was captured and jailed in 1999.Last week, fighters from the PKK - labeled a terrorist group by Turkey, Washington and the European Union - ambushed a military convoy, killing 10 soldiers and wounding about 60."Violence dominates now, from the Kurdish side and is also defining state policy," said Gultan Kisanak, co-chair of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP). "If fighting intensifies further, there's a high risk it will spill over into ethnic clashes as social tensions rise.""Let's return to the path of dialogue and negotiations and lessen the war," she told Reuters at the weekend.The upsurge in violence coincides with efforts by Turkey's parliament to draft a more liberal constitution to replace a hardline charter drawn up after a 1980 military coup, and the government says it will include greater political freedoms for minorities. Parliament reconvenes after summer recess on October 1.Recognizing Kurdish identity and rights are fundamental to Turkey's effort to join the European Union. It became a candidate for membership in 1999, but its drive has stalled over slow progress on human rights and arguments about Cyprus."The Kurdish problem is about rights and freedom, it's a legal issue, and a solution requires a constitutional foundation," Kisanak said."We need to focus on policies for peace and establish a climate of peace. Otherwise it's insincere to work on a constitution while people are dying and blood is being spilled."Some political analysts link the violence with the failure of secret peace talks, thought to have been held in 2010, in Oslo between intelligence officials and PKK negotiators.OUTPOSTS ATTACKEDThe PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984 in a campaign to carve out an ethnic homeland in mainly Kurdish southeastern Turkey. More than 40,000 people, most of them Kurds, have died in the ensuing violence.The rebels have scaled back their demands for more political autonomy for Turkey's estimated 15 million ethnic Kurds.In the latest fighting, one soldier and three PKK fighters were killed late on Saturday after the rebels attacked two military outposts near the town of Tunceli.More than a dozen people were hurt when an angry crowd stormed the BDP's local offices in the town of Bingol on Friday.The BDP denies any outright connection with the guerrillas and has criticized some PKK attacks, but opponents say it has not distanced itself enough from the group.Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey will halt its operations against the militants once they lay down arms.An outspoken critic of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Erdogan has accused Syria of arming the PKK in recent months.Kisanak disagreed and said fighting with the PKK had flared before relations with erstwhile ally Syria soured."There is a tendency in Turkey to continually look for excuses to blame domestic problems on the outside," she said.Erdogan has signaled that some BDP lawmakers, including Kisanak, could lose their immunity to prosecution, granted to all members of parliament, after they were photographed last month embracing PKK fighters who had stopped their convoy on a road in the southeast.Courts have banned most of the BDP's predecessors for links with the PKK, and pro-Kurdish parties were out of parliament between 1994 and 2007."There is now a serious risk that parliament will debate our immunity, pushing Kurds outside of the political process," Kisanak said. "We need to keep the BDP, the Kurds, within politics to end the war and turn to dialogue and negotiations."	4	3	3	4	3	3	4	4	3	4	3	1	1	3	3

600	tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562	LONDON (AP) — For decades, Jimmy Savile was a fixture on British television — an eccentric, aggressively jocular host of children's shows and a tireless charity fundraiser. When he died last year at 84 — by then knighted as Sir Jimmy — he drew tributes from Prince Charles and thousands of fans.Now several women have come forward to claim "Sir Jimmy" was also a sexual predator who abused underage girls.The allegations have set off ripples of shock — but not of surprise. There had, colleagues said, long been rumors. The main question being asked now is: Why did no one do anything?"Maybe it was just the fact that Jimmy knew everybody," Esther Rantzen, a former BBC journalist and founder of the ChildLine child-protection charity, told Channel 4 news. "We made him into the Jimmy Savile who was untouchable, who nobody could criticize."Child protection advocates say the case fits a pattern seen in the response to the child-molesting Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky and in the English town of Rochdale, where a gang of men groomed vulnerable young girls for sex. Authorities in both places have been criticized for failing to act on claims of abuse.The allegations against Savile are made in a documentary, "Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile," to be shown Wednesday on Britain's ITV channel.The program alleges that Savile abused girls in his Rolls-Royce, in a mobile home and at BBC's television headquarters. It includes interviews with a woman who says Savile sexually assaulted her while she was a student at the Duncroft special-needs school near London, and with a former BBC staff member who says she saw the entertainer indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl.The BBC said no one had made any allegations against Savile while he worked there."The BBC has conducted extensive searches of its files to establish whether there is any record of misconduct or allegations of misconduct by Sir Jimmy Savile during his time at the BBC. No such evidence has been found," it said in a statement.Savile's family has condemned the vilification of a man who is not alive to defend himself."The guy hasn't been dead for a year yet and they're bringing these stories out," said Savile's nephew Roger Foster. "It could affect his legacy, his charity work, everything. I'm very sad and disgusted."Mark Williams-Thomas, who made the documentary, insisted it was right "to tackle this highly sensitive subject and allow these women to have a voice — a voice that for many was not heard whilst they were children."Savile was, in the words of his obituary in the Daily Telegraph, "an eccentric adornment to British public life," known for his platinum hair, garish tracksuits, chunky gold jewelry and ever-present cigars.The former coal miner claimed to have organized Britain's first disco and to have been the first DJ to use two turntables — a claim that has frequently been disputed.He was the original presenter of the music countdown program "Top of the Pops," which ran on BBC television from 1964 to 2006, featuring performances by everyone from The Rolling Stones to the Sex Pistols. For almost 20 years from 1975, Savile also made dreams come true on "Jim'll Fix It," a TV show in which he responded to children's letters by arranging for their wishes to be realized.Savile championed a host of good causes, frequently running marathons to raise money. He led work to collect millions for the creation of a national spinal injuries center at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in southern England and bequeathed money for a heart unit at Leeds infirmary named the Savile Institute.Prince Charles was among those who paid tribute when he died in October 2011 and thousands paid their respects at his coffin.Although he was part of the nation's childhood, Savile remained a distant figure — well-known rather than well-loved. His guarded private life was the subject of a much watched television documentary in 2000 by filmmaker Louis Theroux.Savile, who never married and lived alone, told Theroux he'd never liked children. Part of his home in Leeds was a shrine to his late mother, whom he called The Duchess. After her death in 1973, he spent five days alone with her body.In recent days, several people have come forward to say Savile's predatory behavior had been common knowledge in showbiz circles.Music broadcaster Paul Gambaccini told ITV television that Savile had used his charity work to discourage newspaper stories about his private life.Gambaccini recalled Savile telling one journalist, "'well you could run that story, but if you do there goes the funds that come in to Stoke Mandeville — do you want to be responsible for the drying up of the charity donations?' And they backed down."Surrey Police have acknowledged that they questioned Savile in 2007 over an allegation related to the Duncroft school. The file was passed onto prosecutors, who declined to bring charges.The Crown Prosecution Service is facing questions about its actions, as is the BBC, Savile's longtime employer. The BBC's "Newsnight" program worked on a piece on the abuse allegations late last year but decided not to broadcast it for what the BBC called "editorial reasons."Chris Cloke, head of child protection awareness at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, said if any good came from the Savile saga it would be "a better understanding of how cases like this have happened, a greater understanding that protecting children must be everybody's responsibility.""There is a concern that children aren't listened to," he said, "and that is something that has been around for a very long time."___Jill Lawless can be reached at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless	4	3	4	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	3	2	3	4	4

He said the companies had "a great relationship." Facebook, by contrast, got this chilly description: "We're very different companies."[More from Mashable: New Twitter: How to Unite Your Avatar and Header Image [VIDEO]]Facebook was pursuing symmetric networks, Costolo said, but Twitter saw the world as asymmetric. They were fundamentally opposed, and competed for ad dollars.He also spoke of Twitter needing to have control over its own user experience. This was on the day that Twitter unified its experience across iPhone, iPad and the website (and produced an Android app that seemed to us more of an afterthought).[More from Mashable: What Twitter’s New Apps Mean For Developers]"We'll see how it evolves," was Costolo's judgment of Android. (He also said Twitter saw itself primarily as a mobile company -- taken together, an implicit endorsement of the iOS platform.)This year has seen Twitter abruptly shut off API access to an increasing number of companies. It has also seen Twitter deeply integrate into Apple's Mountain Lion and iOS6 systems -- ahead of Facebook integration.The interview gave us a lot of context on how Twitter sees itself, and what developers who depend on the company can expect. Costolo clearly stated he wanted a large ecosystem (just as Apple has), but hinted at one that was very strictly and centrally controlled (much like Apple's).What does this mean for the future of Twitter? Will Apple become ever more integrated, and vice-versa? Give us your predictions in the comments.This story originally published on Mashable here.	3	3		3	3	2	2	3	3	2	3	3	1	1	3	4
602	twitter-ceo-promises-interactive-tweets-defends-curbs-231405541--sector	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter will soon roll out a free tool for users to handpick and publish selections of tweets, reflecting the company's commitment to remain a neutral, interactive platform rather than become a media company, CEO Dick Costolo said Friday.The new tool will allow users, including journalists, to manually curate and display tweets to accompany breaking news events."We've known for a long time that for events in the real world, the shared experience is on Twitter," Costolo said at the Online News Association conference in San Francisco. "We want to create an ability to curate those events."Costolo dismissed speculation that Twitter had plans to operate like a traditional media company, following a recent move to restrict access to tweets only through its website or official app. Previously, many users could read tweets through third-party applications with extra features.Observers had widely predicted that Twitter, founded in 2006, is intent on treating its stream of published tweets much like a traditional media product that it has full control over, and which it can charge for advertising."It's not about being a destination," Costolo said. "I'm a huge believer in syndication. Platform companies always outflank and outlast point solutions and individual products."The decision to tighten control over tweets came after the company realized it had invested significant resources in its service, but other companies were making money off of it without adding "accretive value," Costolo said."We were spending all this money" eliminate fake accounts and improve the Twitter experience, Costolo said, but users still had a "choice" of "experiences." Fake accounts may be created by spammers or impersonators.But the company has promised to unlock Twitter's full interactive potential once it has regained control over how users access Twitter across desktop computers and mobile devices.Soon, users will see tweet boxes, known as cards, include live features that will look nothing like the 140-character messages units that they evolved in the early days of the service.Costolo offered examples of interactive features, such as live polls for the NBA All Star game showing real-time results directly within a tweet box."We want to migrate to a world in which the 140 characters can serve as a caption for additional functionality," Costolo said. "We'd like that to include things like real-time data, even an application functionality."One of the services available on third-party clients but not from Twitter itself - the ability for a user to download the full archive of his or her tweets - will be available by the end of the year, Costolo predicted.In the hour-long talk, Costolo also revealed the scorching pace of expansion at his company. Twitter, which relocated into new offices in central San Francisco in July, now boasts 1,300 employees, more than three times its headcount just 18 months.(Reporting By Gerry Shih; Editing by Richard Chang)	3	3	4	3	3	2	1	3	3	1	3	2	1	1	3	4
603	twitter-ceo-thinking-ways-embrace-ecommerce-114134651	Twitter and its CEO Dick Costolo may be open to an alternative source of revenue in the future after all: Ecommerce.[More from Mashable: Will Twitter Replace Your Follower Count?]During an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Costolo suggested that the company is considering ways to "participate" in transactions that take place on the social network.“It’s particularly interesting in areas where you’ve got things like perishable inventory, like tickets,” Costolo told CNBC in response to a question about ways Twitter could potentially grow its business. “We observe that and are paying attention to that, and are thinking about the kinds of ways we could participate in that value exchange.”[More from Mashable: ‘Unavoidable’ Bacon Shortage Leads to Twitter Hysteria]Even just the suggestion that Twitter might be looking into e-commerce options represents a significant about-face for Costolo from a few months ago. At the AllThingsD media conference in January, Costolo shot down any plans to go this route by noting that, "We don't feel like we need to add another component to the business."In the time since then, Twitter has focused on building up its suite of advertising products -- Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts -- by rolling these features out to dozens more countries and giving advertisers additional tools to better target specific users. These efforts appear to be paying off for the company, as it's expected to generate more than $1 billion in annual ad revenue by 2014.Of course, just because ad revenue is growing doesn't mean Twitter should ignore other potential sources of revenue.While Costolo didn't offer much in the way of detail in the CNBC interview about how Twitter might approach Ecommerce, he has suggested in the past that there's an opportunity for Twitter to make it easier for businesses to sell tickets and other limited-time items through tweets. Twitter could then potentially take a cut of these transactions.Twitter briefly dabbled in the Ecommerce space back in 2010 with its Early Bird initiative. Twitter promoted limited-time discounts from retailers from an @EarlyBird account and earned revenue from the sales. However, this effort was shut down after just a few months.Do you think Twitter should try again to make Ecommerce work?

Tidal waves of tweeted hate dumping on NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Fans flexing wit in snarky messages. Players sharing uncharacteristically candid thoughts.These were just a few of the ways in which the sports Twittersphere blew up as seldom seen on Monday following the Green Bay Packers loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Twitter was so frothy because the game ended in seemingly unfathomable fashion and ignited long simmering tension between fans, players and the league about a labor standoff between the NFL and its regular officials' union.[More from Mashable: NFL Player Blasts Replacement Refs on Twitter, Then Ridicules Fans]To recap, here's what happened:The Packers lost to the Seahawks in Monday Night Football on a last-second hail-mary pass by Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson — a pass that was actually intercepted and let stand as a touchdown after the NFL’s replacement officials had what can only be described as a refereeing fiasco. Initially, one ref signalled touchdown and another touchback, meaning he thought it was an interception. After a review, the call (the one that was a touchdown) stood, and eventually the game ended.Why were the refs replacements? That labor dispute, which has resulted in referees from the lowest rungs of organized football overseeing the NFL preseason and first three weeks of the regular season.Immediately after the game, Twitter flew into a frenzy.

606	two-suicide-bombers-hit-somali-capital-witnesses-155930402	MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Two suicide bombers walked into a restaurant in central Mogadishu and blew themselves killing at least six people, witnesses said, less than a week after militant bombers targeted the country's new president.A Reuters photographer said he could see six bodies as well as the severed heads of the two bombers. Chairs and tables were strewn across the restaurant and pools of blood covered the flooring."Two suicide bombers targeted a restaurant called 'The Village' opposite the theatre. There are bodies and there are wounded people," said Mohamed Sheikh, a security guard at the National Theatre located opposite the blast site.The election of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud last week was hailed by his supporters as a vote for change in a country mired in conflict for more than two decades.But the latest attacks underscore the security challenges the political newcomer faces as African forces battle to quash a five-year insurgency waged by the Islamist rebel group, al Shabaab.The restaurant, called "The Village", is owned by a well known Somali businessman who returned to Somalia from Britain recently.(Reporting by Abdi Sheikh and Mohamed Ahmed; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by James Macharia)	2	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	3	2	1	4	2	4

The United States Ambassador to the United Nations was a self-proclaimed "skeptic" of the power of social media."I thought it might cheapen the coin," Rice said at this year's Social Good Summit while speaking with Mashable CEO Pete Cashmore.[More from Mashable: Social Good Summit Day 1: Highlights and Pics]But Rice said she quickly changed her tune, realizing that Twitter and other social media outlets provide the tools and machinery to make everyone more aware of global issues, to bring great visibility to important issues in places that can't be seen and engage people that are often overlooked in conversation.And most importantly, Rice felt that the immediacy and briefness of tweets forced her and her colleagues to "distill messages to their very essence," and forgo political doublespeak.Now an avid Twitter user (as well as YouTube andFacebook), Rice says she uses her following to establish causes and bring change. Recently she reached out to the women of Libya via social media, encouraging them to register to vote and have their voices heard in the election. She even admits to calling out "bad guys" and dictators on Twitter for their reprehensible behavior.Rice, appointed by President Obama, also spoke about the administration's focus on using technology to make accountability and transparency a two-way street between the public and elected officials. Initiatives like Data.gov, she says, have given power to the people in understanding how the government works and how it can be more innovative in problem-solving.She also recalled the Syrian ambassador's effort to keep citizens informed by posting messages to Facebook about the location of Syrian tanks. This type of real-time updating would have been impossible without social media, said Rice."When it comes to foreign policy -- this is not the most necessarily modern and agile aspect, traditionally, of American government, but under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, the State Department has harnessed social media to be a much more effective tool of our outreach," Rice said.But Rice stays somewhat realistic about the ability for social media to mobilize people to a point of making government obsolete. It's important to remember social media is a tool, not a solution, she said, adding social media provides limitations in space and remains inaccessible in certain areas of the world that need it most, such as Zimbabwe.Further, social media can be harnessed in negative ways, Rice said.Cashmore agreed. "The tech itself is neutral, it's what you do with it that counts," he said.The government will remain a central "part of the puzzle" in the fight for change, Rice said. She added that infrastructure, public education, and research and development are mainly responsibilities of the government, not of social media.Has social media helped you feel more connected to global politics and issues?

608	u-answers-florida-cry-end-tomato-pact-mexico-223303256--finance	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's administration took a big step on Thursday toward terminating a 16-year-old tomato trade agreement with Mexico following a request from growers in Florida, an important swing state in the presidential election.The decision surprised Mexican officials and tomato producers, who have offered to renegotiate the pact. They argue the 1996 agreement has benefited U.S. consumers and brought stability to the North American market.Florida growers, who traditionally compete with Mexico for the U.S. winter and early spring tomato market, have pressed the Obama administration since June to terminate the pact.Many U.S. agricultural and business groups weighed in favor of keeping the current pact out of fears the dispute could spark a tomato trade war that would have collateral damage on other commodities.An end to the agreement would clear the way for U.S. growers to seek anti-dumping duties that could lead to higher prices for Mexican tomatoes sold in the United States."Today's preliminary decision is welcome news to domestic growers and the workers who have suffered under an outdated and failed agreement governing trade in fresh tomatoes with Mexico," Reggie Brown, executive director of the Florida Tomato Exchange, said in a statement.Mexican growers export about $1.9 billion worth of tomatoes to the United States. They say Florida producers have failed to keep pace with technology changes that have produced a tastier Mexican tomato and propelled sales in the United States.Francisco de Rosenzweig, a senior Mexican Economy Ministry official, said Mexico's government was "very surprised" by the decision, particularly as it came one day before a long-awaited meeting between Mexican growers and the Commerce Department."It's very unfortunate that they issued a preliminary decision against us first before sitting down with the Mexican producers," de Rosenzweig told Reuters.Martin Ley, a spokesman for Mexican producers, said they would put forth a "strong proposal" in the Friday meeting with U.S. officials, which they still hope will lay the foundation for a new pact.Mexico's Economy Minister Bruno Ferrari told Reuters earlier this week it was "obvious" the Florida Tomato Exchange had timed its request to put political pressure on the White House ahead of the November 6 presidential election, he said.Florida is one of several battleground states expected to determine the outcome of the Nov 6 election, where Obama is running against Republican challenger Mitt Romney.The U.S. Commerce Department stopped short of immediately tearing up the agreement, as Florida growers requested in June.But it took a preliminary position in favor of ending the pact and said it would make a final decision "as soon as practicable" and in no longer than 270 days."While we would have preferred that today's announcement would have ended the fight, the preliminary decision ratifying the domestic industry's position will help reverse the downward spiral the industry has been facing," Brown said.The existing pact is called a "suspension agreement" because the Commerce Department suspended an anti-dumping investigation against Mexico in 1996 and negotiated a minimum price at which Mexican tomatoes can be sold in the United States.Florida growers complain the agreement fails to protect them against Mexican tomatoes sold below the cost of production. Ditching the agreement would allow Florida producers to file for new tariffs.U.S. distributors of fresh produce sided with Mexico in the dispute, calling the notice of intent to terminate the agreement a "slap in the face" to the Mexicans and noting that thousands of jobs in border states rely on the tomato importing business.The Fresh Produce Association of America accused Washington of acting hastily on political motives and said numerous U.S. industry groups had lobbied to uphold the tomato agreement."Even Walmart, the biggest retailer in the world, supported keeping the tomato suspension agreement," said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the group said.(Reporting By Doug Palmer; Additional reporting by Adriana Barrera in Mexico City; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrew Hay)	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	3	2	3	4

611	u-led-war-drugs-questioned-u-n-220226481	UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The presidents of Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala all called for a vigorous global debate of anti-narcotics laws at the United Nations on Wednesday, raising new questions about the wisdom of the four-decade-old, U.S.-led "war on drugs."Although none of the leaders explicitly called for narcotics to be legalized, they suggested at the U.N. General Assembly that they would welcome wholesale changes to policies that have shown scant evidence of limiting drug flows while contributing to massive violence throughout Latin America."It is our duty to determine - on an objective scientific basis - if we are doing the best we can or if there are better options to combat this scourge," Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said.Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who leaves office on December 1 after spending much of his presidency locked in a bloody battle with drug-smuggling gangs, called on the United Nations to lead a global debate over a less "prohibitionist" approach to drugs.Guatemala's President Otto Perez Molina echoed Calderon's call and went even further, saying that "the basic premise of our war against drugs has proved to have serious shortcomings."The speeches, which were a few hours apart, constituted some of the most public challenges to date of anti-drug policies that have been mostly unchanged since the 1970s.Mexico and Colombia are two of Washington's firmest allies in Latin America and both work closely with U.S. anti-drug efforts. While the subject of legalization was discussed at an Americas-wide summit in Colombia attended by U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this year, raising the once-taboo subject at the 193-nation meeting in New York amounts to an escalation of the debate.Obama has ruled out any major changes to drug laws, but some U.S. diplomats privately concede that the consensus around Latin America is clearly swinging against the status quo, and that some degree of change is imminent.All three leaders were careful to say they were not proposing giving in to smuggling gangs that have made Latin America one of the world's most violent regions. Mexico has been particularly hard hit in recent years, with an estimated 60,000 people killed in drug-related violence during Calderon's six-year term as he attempted to crack down on cartels."We won't cede an inch" to the gangs, Calderon said.ESCALATING THE DEBATECalderon and Santos have suggested on other occasions that they might be open to legalization of narcotics if that helped reduce violence.Colombia remains one of the world's biggest producers of cocaine despite a decade of U.S.-sponsored eradication efforts, while Mexico has seen unprecedented violence as a transit point for drugs into the United States, the world's biggest consumer of narcotics.An influential group of former Latin American leaders including Brazilian ex-President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has openly advocated decriminalization of some drugs as a way to reduce violence.The small, relatively prosperous South American nation of Uruguay has gone the furthest, sending a bill to Congress last month that would allow the state to grow and sell marijuana.In his comments on Wednesday, Santos described the debate over drug policy as "a discussion that the world has avoided for many years, and one we hope will produce concrete results.""The debate on drugs must be frank, and without a doubt, global," Santos said.Calderon repeated his calls for Washington to tighten gun controls to stop weapons flowing from the United States into the hands of Mexican drug cartels. He has also urged Washington to revive a ban on assault weapons in the United States that expired in 2004.(Editing by Kieran Murray and Mohammad Zargham)	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	2	2	4	4	
612	u-n-chief-duped-prank-call-fake-canadian-010416476	UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A pair of Canadian radio comedians said on Thursday it took them less than an hour to get U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the phone during international diplomacy's busiest week - by pretending to be Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.Ban was between meetings at the U.N. General Assembly of world leaders on Wednesday when he took a phone call from Quebec comedy duo "The Masked Avengers," famous for tricking celebrities and politicians.The pair said in a statement that the impersonator of the prime minister, who is known for his helmet-like coiffure, apologized to Ban for not being able to attend the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York because he was too busy combing his hair with super glue.During the five-minute discussion, the pair also said they asked him to speak with National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman to press for a Quebec City hockey team. It was at this point in the conversation - which switched between English and French - they said Ban realized he was being pranked.Ban has more than 120 meetings with world leaders during the U.N. General Assembly this week and his spokesman described the prank call as not "the best use of his time.""The Secretary-General quickly understood that it was a prank, and he took it in the way that it was intended, as a joke," Ban's spokesman said. "It's a busy time of year, and the Secretary-General has a considerable amount to do, so it wasn't the best use of his time, but these things happen."The same radio duo, Sébastien Trudel and Marc-Antoine Audette of Montreal radio station CKOI-FM, also duped U.S. Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin just days before the 2008 election by pretending to be French President Nicolas Sarkozy and convincing her to accept an invitation to hunt baby seals.Their other victims have included U.S. business tycoon Donald Trump, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and rock stars Bono and Mick Jagger.(This story was corrected to state that Ban was between meetings when he took call)(Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Eric Walsh)	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	1	3	1	1	1	3	4

Human Rights Council in Geneva in February.Torture is a criminal offence in Morocco but no official has publicly stood trial for crimes involving torture.Mendez said Rabat may need to amend the definition of torture "to bring the offence in line with international law".U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said earlier this month Morocco, a staunch U.S. ally in North Africa, could be a regional model after it managed to contain Arab Spring protests with reforms.But she urged Rabat to reform the courts, make government more open and respect human rights.Last week, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged Morocco to investigate accusations police tortured pro-democracy activists to force false confessions.(Reporting By Souhail Karam; Editing by Sophie Hares)	2	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	2	4	3	4
614	u-n-nuclear-chief-amano-stand-another-term-120306330	VIENNA (Reuters) - United Nations nuclear agency chief Yukiya Amano, a key figure in international diplomacy over Iran's disputed nuclear activity, will seek a new four-year term next year, the Vienna-based organization said on Wednesday.Western diplomats say they expect Amano, who has taken a tougher approach on the Iran nuclear file than his predecessor Mohamed ElBaradei, to be reappointed without problems, in contrast to his close election victory in 2009."I don't expect anyone will challenge him," one European diplomat said, adding that Amano has been "very firm" on Iran.The 35-nation governing board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which will decide on the issue by June next year, on Monday set a December 31 deadline for the nomination of candidates. So far, Amano is the only confirmed candidate."The DG (Director General Amano) has announced that he is available for another term," the IAEA's press office said in an e-mail on Wednesday.Under Amano, the IAEA was criticized last year for a perceived slow initial response to Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster and the agency's ties with Tehran have become increasingly strained.However, Western diplomats are generally happy with the way Amano has stepped up pressure on Iran to make it stop stonewalling an agency investigation into suspected atom bomb research, even if that push has yet to bear fruit. Iran denies Western allegations that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons capability.In 2009, supported largely by industrialized nations, Amano defeated South Africa's Abdul Samad Minty in a sixth round of balloting after five inconclusive votes.(Reporting by Fredrik Dahl; Editing by David Goodman)	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	3	3	2	3	2	1	1	3	4
615	u-poor-hiv-patients-live-longer-care-extending-185658177	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Patients stepping into Johns Hopkins University's HIV clinic in east Baltimore don't just see a doctor or get prescriptions for their antiretroviral drugs; many also get help finding a place to live or bus fare to make it to their next appointment.Such care that goes beyond the examination table and into patients' often challenging lives has been key to helping poorer HIV patients - particularly blacks and women - live longer, healthier lives, according to a 15-year study published on Thursday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.Researchers at the university followed 6,366 patients in the mostly black, low-income part of a city marked by abandoned buildings and plagued by an illegal drug trade that drew national attention on the gritty television series "The Wire."From 1995 to 2010, doctors at Hopkins joined with social workers and other experts to treat HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDs, and address other aspects of care that can often derail patients, such as being able to fill prescriptions or access health insurance programs for the needy.They found that with additional assistance, at-risk patients who contract the virus in their late 20s can expect to live to about age 73 despite their race, sex or drug use, compared with some earlier data that showed higher mortality rates among such groups."Just like over time we have developed medications that are easier to take, have fewer toxicities and are more effective, I think we've done exactly the same things in our ability to deliver quality care to this particular population," Dr. Richard Moore, the study's lead author, said in an interview.Moore, a professor of infectious diseases and director of the university's clinic, said the program shows it is possible to counter the impact of economic disparities on healthcare.Even though HIV medications have significantly improved since the virus emerged in the United States decades ago, accessing those medications, receiving consistent care and follow-up appointments for the chronic condition are key, he said.HIV still hits certain populations harder than others, and rising infection rates among gay black men, for example, remain a major worry among public health experts.IMPROVING OUTCOMESPrevious studies have shown that certain groups of HIV patients -- the poor, minorities, women and drug users -- tended to have worse outcomes and die earlier.Moore found that more comprehensive care that addresses problems such as homelessness and a lack of reliable transportation can help an average 28-year-old with HIV live roughly 45 more years with no significantly higher risk of various infections or other complications.Moore also credited the roughly $2 billion Ryan White CARE Act, the largest federal program solely aimed at paying for care for low-income HIV patients who are uninsured or have inadequate coverage. The program, which President Barack Obama extended in 2009, is up for renewal next year.Michael Saag, head of the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Center for AIDS Research, said the new findings underscore the need to revamp the nation's healthcare system so that all people get quality care. HIV patients are lucky to have access to Ryan White funds, but others do not."This is likely a fundamental reason why the poor and disadvantaged in the United States have health disparities that cause disproportionately worse clinical outcomes than those with means," Saag said in an editorial accompanying the study.Over the years, Moore said he and his colleagues have learned what tends to work, and what doesn't, when it comes to their patients.Moore, who has worked at the Hopkins clinic for 24 years, said patients are immediately connected to a case worker who sometimes starts counseling them even before their first appointment.Other clinics have also started similar efforts in recent year, but this more comprehensive type of care is not yet available nationwide."Medical care, particularly for a lot of people who aren't necessarily well-insured or living in a stable situation, you have to just as much deal with all that aspect of assisting them with their lives," Moore said. "I wish that wasn't the case."(Editing by Leslie Adler)	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	4	3	2	3	2	1	1	4	4

617	ultimate-trade-off-eunuchs-live-longer-160319550	LONDON (Reuters) - A study of eunuchs in Korea's royal court has found men without testicles live longer.Researchers looking at the court of the Chosun Dynasty found eunuchs lived to 70 on average, or 14 to 19 years longer than "intact" men of similar socio-economic status.Three of the 81 eunuchs studied lived to 100 or more, giving the group a centenarian rate some 130 times that in developed nations today.During the dynasty, which ran from 1392 to 1910, boys in Korea sometimes underwent castration in order to serve as eunuchs and gain access to the privileged life of the palace.Employed through history as guards or servants in harems across the Middle East and Asia, eunuchs in the Chosun court were allowed to marry and had families through adoption.Kyung-Jin Min of Inha University and Cheol-Koo Lee of Korea University believe the longevity of the eunuchs was not simply attributable to their privileged lifestyle."Except for a few eunuchs, most lived outside the palace and spent time inside the palace only when they were on duty," Min told Reuters.In contrast, the average lifespan of the kings, who spent their whole lives inside the palace, was just 47 years.Previous studies have shown female mammals generally live longer than males, and one explanation is that testosterone weakens the immune system and can increase the chances of heart disease.Scientists have also found that castration typically prolongs lifespan in animals but studies on people have been inconclusive.While data on mentally ill, institutionalized men showed them living longer, the lifespan of castrato singers was not significantly different from their non-castrated counterparts.The study was published in the journal Current Biology.(Reporting by Chris Wickham; editing by Jason Neely)	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	1	3	1	1	1	3	4
618	ultrabooks-anorexic-acer-aspire-s7-080618997	The Acer Aspire S7 comes in two sizes. Sporting a full HD (1,920 x 1,080) display, the 13.3-inch version is just 2.86 pounds and 0.47 of an inch thick. It starts at $1,400.Click here to view this gallery.[More from Mashable: Motorola’s Droid Razr i Packs Intel Inside]Many PC manufacturers stretch the concept of the Ultrabook -- an Intel Core-powered laptop that's "ultra" portable -- by pushing the upper limits of Intel's weight and thickness specs. With the Aspire S7, Acer is admirably doing the opposite, unveiling new 11- and 13-inch designs that are remarkably light and thin.The Aspire S7 is one of the first Windows 8 machines from Acer, and it ships the same day of the launch, Oct. 26. The 11.6-inch S7 weighs just 2.29 pounds and is 0.48 of an inch thick and the 13.3-inch model is 2.86 pounds and is even slightly thinner -- 0.47 inch. That makes the Aspire S7 even more of a featherweight laptop than even the MacBook Air.[More from Mashable: Jack Bauer Bakes Cupcakes for Acer]It's no featherweight in the specs department, though, with both models sporting full HD screens with 1,920 x 1,080 resolution. Similar to the MacBooks, the S7 has an aluminum unibody design, although the lid comes in either aluminum or white Gorilla Glass 2.Did we mention the touch screen? Windows 8, of course, is tailored to be friendly to both touch and mouse-and-keyboard setups, and the S7 lets you do both. The special hinge on the S7 helps out, too: First, it lets the screen fold a full 180 degrees, laying flat with the keyboard. Second, it's a "dual-torque" design, meaning there's very little resistance when first unfolding it, but once you get to a typical usage angle the resistance builds up -- also helpful for touch.Both models sport a pair of USB 3.0 ports and a microHDMI jack for connecting to an external display, plus an SD card slot. The keyboard is backlit.In my brief hands-on with the Aspire S7, I was immediately struck by how light the two designs were. The glass lid looks amazing, though I'd be extra careful about putting it back in its case when not using it -- even with the Gorilla Glass exterior. The keyboard feels nice, although it has an unusual modification to the Caps Lock key (see the gallery).The 11-inch model packs an Intel Core i5 processor and a 128GB solid-state drive for storage. The 13-incher can include a Core i5 or i7 chip and either 128GB or 256GB for storage. Both models come with 4GB of RAM. Prices range from $1,200 to $1,650.How do you like Acer's new Ultrabooks? Think you'll be buying? Sound off in the comments.This story originally published on Mashable here.	4	5	4	4	4	1	2	4	5	4	4	3	3	1	4	
619	unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721	LONDON (Reuters) - A British soldier who did not realise she was pregnant has given birth to a baby boy at the Camp Bastion field hospital in Afghanistan.The Ministry of Defence (MOD) in London said mother and baby were in stable condition and a specialist "Paediatric Retrieval Team" would fly out from Britain to care for them during the long flight home."It is not military policy to allow servicewomen to deploy on operations if they are pregnant. In this instance, the MOD was unaware of her pregnancy," the ministry said.The Daily Mail newspaper, which first reported on the birth, said the woman herself was unaware of the pregnancy.The Mail said the Royal Artillery gunner had conceived before her six-month stint in Afghanistan began. Her pre-deployment training included an eight mile (13 km) march and five mile run. Her job in the field involved providing covering fire for troops fighting insurgents.She was taken to the field hospital after complaining of stomach pains and was informed by doctors that she was about to give birth, the Mail said, citing military sources."This is a unique occurrence, but my team is well-rehearsed in the unexpected and they adapted brilliantly to this situation," said Lieutenant Colonel Andrea Lewis, commanding officer of the field hospital, quoted by the Mail."I am pleased to report the mother and baby are doing well and we are all delighted at the outcome."(Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Alistair Lyon)	3	4	3	3	2	4	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	2	2	4
620	unfazed-deadline-akin-vows-fight-missouri-senate-race-191237598	JEFFERSON CITY, Missouri (Reuters) - If anyone in the Republican Party harbors illusions that Todd Akin will bow out of the Missouri U.S. Senate race by a September 25 deadline, he is quite happy to disabuse them."That's not going to happen," the Missouri congressman told Reuters after a rally Friday afternoon at the state Capitol. "The primary voters of Missouri gave me a job to do. That job is to beat (Democratic incumbent) Claire McCaskill."Akin was pilloried last month when he said in a television interview that women's bodies have natural biological defenses against pregnancy following "legitimate rape."The Republican party turned on Akin, including its presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who said Akin should step aside. Powerhouse conservative groups American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS pulled funding from Missouri, as did the National Republican Senatorial Committee.What Republicans had seen as a likely win in a conservative state in their quest to seize control of the U.S. Senate became an uphill battle. Akin had led polls before the gaffe but a recent poll has McCaskill ahead by 6 percentage points.President Barack Obama's Democrats now control the Senate, 53-47. Republicans would need a net gain of four seats on Election Day to take the chamber, 51-49. They would need just three, however, if Romney wins the White House because control of an evenly split Senate would be determined by the vice president, who breaks all tie votes."If I had to put money on it, I'd bet on a small victory for McCaskill," said Marvin Overby, a politics professor at the University of Missouri at Columbia.With six weeks until the November 6 election there is still time for something dramatic to happen in this race, Overby said.Akin could still leave the race if he files a court petition to do so by this Tuesday. But few believe he will.Akin has several things going for him. He has grassroots conservative support, the former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich is campaigning for him, and Tea Party king-maker and South Carolina U.S. Senator Jim DeMint says he may offer funds to Akin.But he faces a well-funded opponent in McCaskill, who describes Akin as "on the far right" and herself as a bipartisan centrist in a bid for the moderate voters they both need."I believe his views are extreme and out of the mainstream for Missourians," McCaskill said on Friday in a debate with Akin in Columbia."RAPE IS RAPE"Congressman Akin's rape comments have become the butt of a number of jokes, including an "illegitimate rape" whistle - "sounding off on legitimate stupidity" - sold by a group in St. Louis with proceeds going to charity.Those passions prompted by the comments were on display at the Friday rally organized by Missouri Women Standing With Todd Akin, which was attended by around 100 supporters.A few dozen protesters gathered across the road from the state Capitol and chanted "rape is rape.""I am shocked there are women who would stand against their own interests by supporting Todd Akin," said Courtney Cole, sporting a "rape is rape" badge and holding a sign saying "women's rights are human rights.""I hope this wakes women up," she said.Supporters such as Mary Howerton, who said she has known Akin for 20 years and admires the fact that, like her, he had home schooled his children."I honestly don't know why people found Todd Akin's (rape) comments so offensive," Howerton said. "I asked my husband and he said he didn't find them offensive either."Almost all of the speakers at the rally focused on abortion. Stacey Shore, "a mom, a wife and a proud Christian," said "they can call it (abortion) a choice, but the truth is, it's murder.""We are not a moderate state," Shore said. "We are a conservative state and we stand by our Christian values."Akin himself seemed relaxed, taking the microphone from the lectern and strolling in front of a statue of Thomas Jefferson.Afterward, he said he expects Republicans donors "to take a look at this race" if it remains competitive. "Republicans are going to have to ask, 'Are we just going to ignore the fact that this is a race we can win?'" Akin said."THAT SOUNDS LIKE ME"Political scientists note that Akin won the August 7 Missouri primary despite being outspent three to one, so he is no stranger to uphill battles.According to the most recent regulatory filings, as of mid-July McCaskill has raised $10.3 million to Akin's $2.3 million - which he spent in the primary."He has to stay on message. He cannot afford off-the-cuff remarks if he wants to appeal to moderate suburban voters," Overby said.Grassroots supporters say Akin needs to stay focused on jobs and the economy to win. His speech on Friday ended on the economy but otherwise was focused mostly on abortion.McCaskill touts bipartisan compromise to win over moderates. In one television ad called "Fifty," she boasts of a National Journal 2012 ranking of senators from liberal to conservative that places her right in the middle."I work across the aisle and I don't think compromise is a dirty word," McCaskill says in the commercial.Kay Henderson, a sales representative in the St. Louis area, describes herself as a moderate voter who "almost never" votes for Democrats and says she likes the McCaskill commercial."I see myself as a moderate and that ad really speaks to me," she said. "I don't know if it will make me vote for McCaskill, but I'm tired of extremes and want the folks in Washington to work together and get things done."

621	union-buster-walker-calls-return-union-refs-142710047--spt	MADISON, Wis. (AP) — If there's one thing that can unite political foes in Wisconsin, it just may be the Green Bay Packers.Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who made a national name for himself by going after public employee unions last year, posted a message on Twitter calling for the return of the NFL's locked-out unionized officials after a disputed call led to a Seattle Seahawks 14-12 victory over the Packers on Monday night."After catching a few hours of sleep, the (hash)Packers game is still just as painful. (hash)Returntherealrefs," Walker tweeted early Tuesday.Democratic state Sen. Jon Erpenbach, who was one of 14 Democrats who fled to Illinois for three weeks last year in opposition to Walker's union proposal, said he saw the irony in Walker's post but in Wisconsin "we're all fans, first and foremost.""If you were born and raised in Wisconsin, you were raised on the Packers," Erpenbach said. "Every Sunday it's Packers and pancakes, not necessarily in that order."The NFL locked out the officials in June after their contract expired. The league has been using replacement officials, and through three weeks of the regular season there has been much criticism over the way some games are being handled.Walker's spokesman Cullen Werwie tried to spin the governor's post on Tuesday, saying it wasn't meant as a pro-union political statement. Walker's tweet was being widely mocked on Twitter in light of his push last year that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers, nurses and most other public workers."I don't think this anything to do with unions, but has everything to do with refs making bad calls," Werwie said.Erpenbach was so incensed over the game that around midnight Monday night he tweeted two different public phone numbers for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and urged people to call and voice their displeasure."I could never ref an NFL football game, ever," Erpenbach said. "The replacement refs are doing the best they can do out there, but the commissioner doesn't want this to sink to a World Wrestling Federation-type event on Sunday. They have to do something. It calls into question the integrity of the game."While Erpenbach himself plans to leave a message for Goodell urging an end to the referee labor dispute, he won't be advising the Packers to employ the same tactics he and the other Democratic senators did last year."I would not recommend the Packers get on a bus and leave the state," he said.	3	3	2	4	3	3	3	4	4	1	3	3	1	2	3	4
622	unique-hometown-advantage-donald-medinah-173015559--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - Much is made of home advantage at Ryder Cups and Britain's Luke Donald finds himself in the unusual position of being the only 'local' player on either team at Medinah Country Club this week.The English former world number one spent four years at the nearby Northwestern University, married a Chicago girl and has lived in the 'Windy City' ever since."It's a unique situation for me," Donald told reporters on Wednesday. "I make my home here, 25 miles just north of here. I've been living here for 15 years. I'll be the only guy on both teams that is more familiar with this town than probably anyone."Hopefully I can garner a little bit of the support from the crowd because of that and turn that into a slight advantage for Team Europe, but it certainly is a unique experience for me."Donald, an avid painter who studied art at Northwestern, has never forgotten his English roots, despite becoming an unabashed fan of Chicago which is known worldwide for its varied culture, soaring sky-scrapers and deep-dish pizza."I always consider myself British through and through," he smiled. "I've obviously reaped the benefits of going through the college system over here, that really helped me with my golf, and I enjoy living here."I feel very comfortable here, but I don't think that changes how you feel about where you grew up. I still have a very close relationship with my country. I still have a lot of family that are there and I visit there regularly."ARDENT CUBS SUPPORTERSince making his home base in Chicago, Donald has become an ardent supporter of Major League Baseball's Chicago Cubs and he feels the city's sports fans will give the Ryder Cup a raucous but respectful atmosphere over the three-day competition."The thing that appeals to me about Chicago is that the people are very friendly," he said. "They are very much into their sports and they get into it and they get raucous and they get loud."From what I've seen, they are respectful fans, and they certainly enjoy it. They get up for it. But I think they will do it in a good spirit."Donald, who has played on three triumphant European teams in his only three appearances at the Ryder Cup, likes the look of the ultra-long No. 3 Course at Medinah."I have played here a couple of times in the last few weeks, just to get a feel for the golf course," said the 34-year-old Englishman who has built an impressive 8-2-1 Ryder Cup record. "The golf course is pretty much in front of you."There are not too many tricks to it. It's about looking at the greens and figuring out where to put the ball in the right positions, because the greens are fast and slopey."That's the key to this golf course if you want to make a lot of birdies is just putting it in the right place."(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes; Editing by Frank Pingue)	2	2	2	3	4	2	2	2	2	3	2	3	2	1	2	3
623	unraveling-obamas-foreign-policy-070000230	Three days after Ambassador Chris Stevens was assassinated, Jay Carney told the White House press corps it had been the work of a flash mob inflamed by an insulting video about the Prophet Muhammad.As the killers had arrived with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons, this story seemed noncredible on its face.Yet two days later, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice doubled down. Appearing on five Sunday talk shows, she called the massacre the result of a "spontaneous" riot that was neither "preplanned" nor "premeditated."Carney and Rice deceived us. But were they deceived?It is impossible to believe that Carney would characterize the Benghazi, Libya, massacre as the result of a protest that careened out of control unless he had been told to do so by the national security adviser, the White House chief of staff or President Barack Obama himself.Who told Carney to say what he did? Who arranged for Rice to appear on five shows to push this line?Throwing a rope to Rice and Carney, the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said last week that only recently had his team concluded that Benghazi was the work of terrorists.Yet intelligence insiders were leaking to the press the day after Stevens was murdered that it was terrorism.Now that the cover story — that the murder of Stevens and the other Americans was the result of a spontaneous outburst the Obama administration could not have foreseen or prevented — has collapsed, the truth is tumbling out.And the truth is more alarming. For it calls into question the credibility and competence of Obama's security team and the judgment of the president himself.What do we now know?Stevens believed he was on an al-Qaida hit list and so wrote in his diary. He was concerned about a rise in Islamic extremism in the city. "Days before the ambassador arrived from the embassy in Tripoli," The Washington Post reported Sunday, "Westerners had fled the city, and the British had closed their consulate."Rice insisted that the act of barbarism arose out of a protest, but there may not even have been a protest, just a military assault with RPGs, machine guns and mortars that hit a safe house a mile from the consulate, killing two former Navy SEALs, while other U.S. agents fled to the airport.So dangerous is Benghazi, The New York Times reported Friday, FBI agents investigating the ambassador's assassination have yet to venture into the city.Was U.S. intelligence oblivious to how dangerous Benghazi was when Stevens went in? Was not Benghazi's reputation as a haven for Islamic jihadi known to us all before we "liberated" Libya?This is the city U.S. air power saved when Moammar Gadhafi's forces were closing in. It now appears to be an al-Qaidaville where U.S. diplomats and agents dare not tread.Late last week, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton conceded that the Benghazi murders were acts of terror perpetrated by extremists associated with al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb. She alluded to Mali, where an al-Qaida affiliate, the Ansar Dine, has taken over half the country.How grave is that threat?On Thursday, The Associated Press reported that Gen. Carter Ham, head of the U.S. Africa command, met with Mauretania's president to discuss "a possible military intervention ... in north Mali against al-Qaida-linked group members and their allies."Yet Vice President Joe Biden still campaigns through the Rust Belt bellowing, "General Motors is alive, and Osama bin Laden is dead," and Obama still recites his mantra, "al-Qaida is on the path to defeat."The reality. Al-Qaida affiliates have taken over a region of Mali the size of France. Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb may have been in on the Benghazi massacre. Al-Qaida is in Syria fighting for a cause, the overthrow of Bashar Assad, Obama supports. Al-Qaida has helped reignite sectarian war in Iraq. Al-Qaida remains in Pakistan. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula is in Yemen.We failed to cut out or kill the cancer at Tora Bora in 2001, and it has since metastasized and spread across North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.As for the Arab Spring Obama embraced, that has given us the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo and jihadi in Sinai. Our departure from Iraq paved the way to a new sectarian war. The surge troops are out of Afghanistan, and the remaining U.S. troops no longer partner with the Afghan soldiers who are to take over the war.Any doubt about the outcome there when we're gone?Within the past month, anti-American riots, flag burnings and the raising of Islamist banners atop U.S. embassy facilities have occurred in too many countries and capitals to recite.If this is the fruit of a successful engagement with the Islamic world, what would a debacle look like? Rep. Paul Ryan said Sunday, "The Obama foreign policy is unraveling literally before our eyes on our TV screens."Is he wrong?Patrick J.

624	unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288	Three unusual earthquakes that shook a suburb west of Dallas over the weekend appear to be connected to the past disposal of wastewater from local hydraulic fracturing operations, a geophysicist who has studied earthquakes in the region says.Preliminary data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) show the first quake, a magnitude 3.4, hit at 11:05 p.m. CDT on Saturday a few miles southeast of the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport. It was followed 4 minutes later by a 3.1-magnitude aftershock that originated nearby.A third, magnitude-2.1 quake trailed Saturday's rumbles by just under 24 hours, touching off at 10:41 p.m. CDT on Sunday from an epicenter a couple miles east of the first, according to the USGS. The tremors set off a volley of 911 calls, according to Reuters, but no injuries have been reported.Not a coincidenceBefore a series of small quakes on Halloween 2008, the Dallas area had never recorded a magnitude-3 earthquake, said Cliff Frohlich, associate director and senior research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin's Institute for Geophysics. USGS data show that, since then, it has felt at least one quake at or above a magnitude 3 every year except 2010.Frohlich said he doesn't think it's a coincidence that an intensification in seismic activity in the Dallas area came the year after a pocket of ground just south of (and thousands of feet below) the DFW airport began to be inundated with wastewater from hydraulic fracturing.During hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," millions of gallons of high-pressure, chemical-laden water are pumped into an underground geologic formation (the Barnett Shale, in the case of northern Texas) to free up oil. But once fractures have been opened up in the rock and the water pressure is allowed to abate, internal pressure from the rock causes fracking fluids to rise back to the surface, becoming what the natural gas industry calls "flowback," according to the Environmental Protection Agency."That's dirty water you have to get rid of," said Frohlich. "One way people do that is to pump it back into the ground."In a study he recently published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Frohlich analyzed 67 earthquakes recorded between November 2009 and September 2011 in a 43.5-mile (70 kilometers) grid covering northern Texas' Barnett Shale formation. He found that all 24 of the earthquakes with the most reliably located epicenters originated within 2 miles (3.2 km) of one or more injection wells for wastewater disposal.The injection well just south of DFW airport has been out of use since September 2011, according to Frohlich, but he says that doesn't rule it out as a cause of the weekend's quakes. He explained that, though water is no longer being added, lingering pressure differences from wastewater injection could still be contributing to the lubrication of long-stuck faults."Faults are everywhere. A lot of them are stuck, but if you pump water in there, it reduces friction and the fault slips a little," Frohlich told Life's Little Mysteries. "I can't prove that that's what happened, but it's a plausible explanation."History of human-induced earthquakesOliver Boyd, a USGS seismologist and an adjunct professor of geophysics at the University of Memphis, agrees that, in general, links between wastewater injection and seismic activity are plausible."Most, if not all, geophysicists expect induced earthquakes to be more likely from wastewater injection rather than hydrofracking," Boyd wrote in an email to Life's Little Mysteries. "This is because the wastewater injection tends to occur at greater depth where earthquakes are more likely to nucleate. I also agree [with Frohlich] that induced earthquakes are likely to persist for some time (months to years) after wastewater injection has ceased."For past examples of likely human-induced earthquakes, Boyd points to the story of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, a now-closed U.S. Army chemical weapons manufacturing center that operated just outside of Denver until the early '90s.In 1961, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal drilled a 12,000-foot-deep (3,658 meters) waste fluid disposal well near Denver. According to the USGS, "an unusual series of earthquakes erupted in the area soon after."Use of the well was discontinued in February 1966. A year and a half later, on Aug. 9, 1967, a 5.3-magnitude earthquake, the most powerful in Denver's history, struck. It was followed by a 5.2-magnitude quake in the region that November, according to the USGS.Follow Life's Little Mysteries on Twitter @llmysteries.

625	us-fidelis-president-gets-8-state-prison-term-145750266	ST. CHARLES, Mo. (AP) — The former president of US Fidelis has been sentenced to eight years in prison on state charges of stealing and fraud.Darain Atkinson was sentenced Monday in St. Charles.

626	us-military-wants-space-planes-reusable-rockets-122039143	Shrinking space budgets don't stop the U.S. military from dreaming about space planes or rockets capable of flying back and landing on their own.Reusable launch vehicles capable of soaring into space and returning by flying through Earth's atmosphere like airplanes could potentially save millions on expensive launches that typically cost thousands of dollars per pound — especially if they fly frequently. But U.S. military officers and researchers acknowledged the challenge of pushing for next-generation space vehicles during a time of budget cuts."Money is tight, and we have to make tough decisions on where to invest money," said Col. Scott Patton from Air Force Space Command. "In the long term, we need full spectrum launch capability at dramatically lower cost."The U.S. government spent tens of millions of dollars on space plane programs in past decades — not to mention the $3 billion National Aero-Space Plane project — but most never got off the ground before cancellation. Such half steps need to change if the U.S. hopes to create a launch vehicle that can truly revolutionize launch costs, Air Force researchers said. [Evolution of the Space Plane (Infographic)]"The reality is that if you're going to learn, you have to go out there and fly hardware," said Jess Sponable, a program manager at the Air Force Research Laboratory.Sponable and Patton represented two of the expert panel discussing reusable launch vehicles at the AIAA Space 2012 conference hosted by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in Pasadena, Calif., on Sept. 13.Making the dream realThe dream of space planes has often raced ahead of reality — original arguments for NASA's space shuttles envisioned flights once per week at a cost of just $20 million. But the space shuttle program ended up flying just several times per year at a cost of about $1.6 billion per flight.The Air Force's robotic space plane X-37B, a miniature version of the space shuttle, has flown two missions aimed at testing satellite technologies, rather than paving the way for cheap, reusable launch vehicles. Like the retired space shuttle, X-37B launches aboard a rocket and flies back down to Earth after reentering the planet's atmosphere. [Photos: Air Force's Secret X-37B Missions]"We've got to learn how to build and fly this class of system," Sponable said. "It's some strange, in-between hybrid that's not an aircraft and not a rocket."The private space industry has also experimented with the space plane concept. SpaceShipOne, a private suborbital space plane, won the $10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004. But the air-launched vehicle and its SpaceShipTwo successor are more suited to carrying space tourists to the edge of space rather than lift heavy cargo.Bringing rockets backPerhaps the most promising reusable launch vehicle designs won't be space planes at all, but simply reusable rockets. SpaceX, the firm founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk, has begun working on a reusable rocket concept called the Grasshopper that puts landing gear on a Falcon 9 rocket's core stage."We emphasize we don't care if [a solution] has wings or no wings — we want maintenance to be minimal," Sponable said. "How you fly it and how it actually looks like is a secondary issue."The Air Force Research Laboratory has also studied a reusable rocket concept under its Reusable Booster System (RBS) Pathfinderprogram. The "rocket-back" concept would involve the rocket firing its engines to reverse its climb and glide back down to an aircraft-style landing.Rocket-back designs from Andews Space, Boeing and Lockheed Martin came out of the Phase I contracts that wrapped up this month. The next step would have involved a $55-75 million contract to build it, not including launch costs — but the Air Force decided to discontinue funding and shelve the project."The program office was satisfied that at least one feasible system solution would have been proposed," said Jeffrey Zweber, program manager for RBS Pathfinder.Driving down the launch costProgram cancellations make the immediate future of space planes or reusable rockets seem uncertain. But the overall market and demand for space launch services continues to grow and could support new, cheaper ways to get into space, said David Byers, an independent consultant to the U.S. government on space propulsion and power.The private space industry may end up paving the way during a time of less government spending — especially with companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX working to drive down launch concepts through its conventional Falcon rockets and its more experimental Grasshopper concept. Future space plane projects would do well to learn from the SpaceX example, Air Force researchers said."We need to reconcile why Elon was able to do what he did with the money spent, on an order of magnitude lower cost than what models would have predicted," Sponable said.Zweber, Sponable's Air Force Research Laboratory colleague, also gave the cautious thumbs up for the SpaceX approach."I think we all wish them the best and hope they deliver on what they promise," Zweber said.This story was provided by TechNewsDaily, sister site to SPACE.com.

627	us-state-dept-blasts-cnn-report-stevens-diary-001439060	LOS ANGELES (AP) — A U.S. State Department spokesman says CNN reported on the personal journal of slain American ambassador Christopher Stevens over objections from his family.The news channel posted in a story online Saturday that it found a journal belonging to Stevens four days after he died in a Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.State Department spokesman Philippe Reines says CNN broke a pledge to the late ambassador's family that it wouldn't report on the diary. Reines is a senior adviser to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.He called CNN's actions "indefensible." CNN did not immediately return a call seeking comment.The channel said in the story online that it took "newsworthy tips" from Stevens' diary and confirmed them with other sources.	2	2	2	3	2	2	1	2	2	1	2	1	1	2	2	4
628	usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A love of Ernest Hemingway's writing and the thrill of tracking down his many works led a Mississippi physician to amass a huge literary collection and donate it to the University of South Carolina so students and scholars could share it, the doctor said Tuesday."It's like an Easter egg hunt. You just don't know what's going to pop up," Edgar Grissom said as he described his 50-year effort to compile all of Hemingway's English-language publications."I have the most complete collection of his primary works in existence," said Grissom. "There's no equal to it."The 70-year-old Grissom was joined by his wife Julie, 46, at a special showing of the collection in the Ernest F. Hollings Special Collection Library on USC's Columbia campus. Dozens of books in their original dust jackets, along with pamphlets, magazines, proofs and papers are on display in glass-covered cases.Teachers will be able to access the collection to help students better understand Hemingway's creative writing process, university officials said."It provides a tremendous resource. It makes writing real in a very powerful way," said William Rivers, chairman of the university's English Department. "There is no other place in the world now where scholars can go to look at Hemingway's primary materials."Grissom said his efforts began in his 20s as a medical student, and grew over the years. From the time he first read "The Green Hills of Africa," until he published his own bibliography of Hemingway's work in 2011, Grissom said he intended his collection to be used by scholars.Grissom said the collection includes more than 1,200 copies of novels and first editions as well as 2,500 additional items such as editor's proofs that few collectors even know exist.Grissom said he and his wife were donating the collection to South Carolina because he was given encouragement and advice by several USC scholars over the years. He said he encountered resistance from many research libraries and museums."I could give you story after story of Hemingway scholars who told me to get lost," Grissom said. "They didn't think an amateur had any business doing this."In particular, Grissom said he was advised by the late USC English professor Matthew Bruccoli, an F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar, as well as Patrick Scott, the former director of USC's Rare Books and Special Collections, and Elizabeth Suddeth, who took over Scott's post last year."I had a special relationship with the University of South Carolina that I didn't have with anyone else," Grissom said.University officials said the collection is so broad that it makes the school a top research center for the study of Hemingway because it includes some of the rarest of his published works.The collection includes many special items, such as a first edition of "The Sun Also Rises," the first and second editions of "Three Stories and Ten Poems," and three early printings of "The Torrents of Spring." It also includes the first and second printings of the American edition, British edition and other scarce early editions of "In Our Time."____Susanne M.

629	usda-sets-release-time-big-agricultural-reports-224050047--finance	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government plans to change the release time of major agricultural reports to midday, when commodity trading is in full swing, instead of current early morning releases when light trading volumes can exaggerate price moves, the Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday.The new release times, which begin in January, affect the U.S. crop report and five other major agricultural reports. Adoption of around-the-clock futures trading prompted the decision."The shift to a noon release allows for the greatest liquidity in the markets, provides the greatest access to the reports during working hours in the United States, and continues equal access to data among all parties," said USDA Chief Economist Joe Glauber.In May, the world's two major futures exchanges shifted to nearly 24-hour trading days. As a result, USDA's most significant reports were being released when markets were open but trading volume was low.The new release time, noon Eastern Time, will be the first change in release time of USDA reports since 1994.With reports now being released while markets are open, a key issue is assuring speedy and equal access to the data. USDA posts its reports on the Internet at the time of release as well as issuing them in print.The new release time applies to the monthly crop report and its companion report on crops around the globe, the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates; the quarterly Grain Stocks report, issued in March, June, September and January; the Prospective Plantings report in March, the Acreage report in June and the Small Grains Summary in September.USDA decided to continue to release three major livestock reports -- the monthly Cattle on Feed report, quarterly Hogs and Pigs report and periodic Cattle Inventory report -- in the mid afternoon.Farm-sector and market groups generally favored the midday release when USDA polled them. It was backed by CME Group Inc, the operator of the giant Chicago futures exchanges, the trade group Commodity Markets Council, and an array of major U.S. farm groups.Farm-sector groups generally favored the midday release.

630	vanishing-electronics-safer-medical-implants-less-trash-182342707	Biodegradable electronics could one day be used in temporary implants that fight surgical infections or stimulate bone growth and then get absorbed by the body, researchers say. Such vanishing devices could also be deployed en masse during emergencies such as oil spills and then fade away when no longer needed, scientists added. They also suggest these short-lived circuits might one day find use in disposable consumer products to help reduce the environmental impact posed by discarded electronics. The idea suggests a very different philosophy from today's business as usual. The microchips or integrated circuits that make up the heart of modern electronics are typically designed to last as long as possible. "If you look at the history of integrated circuits, one of their key appealing attributes is how they have no moving parts, so you can make devices without the wear and tear you'd get from having moving parts that'd have virtually infinite lifetimes," said researcher John Rogers, a materials scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "Our thought was that maybe it'd be interesting to have integrated circuits that offer the performance of today's integrated circuits but have the opposite lifetime characteristic," Rogers told TechNewsDaily. "They'd offer stable performance, then vanish in water or bio-fluids at programmed times, engineered rates of dissolution." The inspiration for transient electronics came from Rogers and his colleagues' work on biomedical implants such as electronics that help treat problems in the body or monitor life signs that include temperature, heart rate, blood sugar levels and muscle, heart or brain activity. One of the most daunting challenges they face is biocompatibility — making sure any implants they put in do not irritate the body, or invite rejection. [9 Cyborg Enhancements Available Right Now] "One way to avoid the problem entirely is to just develop materials that disappear completely," Rogers said.Over the course of three years, Rogers and his colleagues have created transient versions of all the components found in normal microchips. These include thin sheets of porous silicon; electrodes made of magnesium, an element normally found in the body; and encapsulation layers of magnesium oxide covered by a silk overcoat made from silkworm cocoons. These encapsulation layers are the first to dissolve, and the number of them can help dictate how long these electronics last — days, weeks, months, perhaps even years. To test these materials, the researchers devised a biomedical implant that used heat to fight bacterial infections in surgical wounds in mice. After three weeks, the researchers saw reduced levels of infection at the wound site and only faint residues of the implant. They also developed a fully transient 64-pixel digital camera.Researchers envision vast opportunities for transient electronics. "You can imagine biomedical devices that get implanted in the body, monitor or affect a healing process, and after that healing is completed, they simply disappear, eliminating the need to fish them out again," Rogers said. "You can imagine distributing them in the environment to monitor large-scale chemical spills," he said. "In those cases, you might want wireless sensors that transmit what's going on, but not forever — only until the spill is cleaned up, after which the devices ideally just dissolve in a benign way, eliminating the need for recovery and disposal." "A third area that's a bit more challenging but equally interesting is consumer electronics," Rogers added. "In some ways, it's great that normal integrated circuits last forever, but that might not necessarily be a good thing in a world where people today upgrade their smartphones every couple of years. We're inundated with discarded electronics, and it might be appealing to make new devices that just disappear in landfills, eliminating a huge waste stream we're increasingly having to deal with." In the future, in addition to coming up with new applications for transient electronics, "we'd like to figure out how to manufacture these things at low cost, high volume and with sophisticated functions," Rogers said. "We want to leverage the manufacturing structures that already exist out there in the electronics industry." The scientists detail their findings in tomorrow's (Sept. 28) issue of the journal Science.This story was provided by TechNewsDaily, a sister site to LiveScience.

631	vendola-joins-centre-left-primary-race-italy-113607912	ROME (Reuters) - The head of Italy's Left, Ecology and Freedom party is to run as a candidate in the primary to pick a centre-left candidate for prime minister in next year's national election.Nichi Vendola, governor of the southern region of Puglia and Italy's only openly homosexual senior politician, has helped the SEL party carve a niche as a leftwing alternative to the main centre-left Democratic Party (PD).PD leader Pier Luigi Bersani and Matteo Renzi, the mayor of Florence, are the main candidates in the race to head a centre-left coalition, expected to take place at the end of November.Vendola's announcement came amid talk of a second term for Prime Minister Mario Monti, who has said he will not run in the election but would be available to serve if no clear government emerged from the vote, expected in April."To drive out the fantasy of an encore for Monti and to transform the primaries from the umpteenth party feud into an opportunity for change in this country ... I accept the challenge, to win it," Vendola said.An opinion poll from SWG last week estimated Vendola's share of the ballot among likely voters in the centre-left primary as 7 percent, compared with 60 percent for Bersani and 30 percent for Renzi.SEL's support in the overall electorate stood at 5.4 percent, the same poll found.(Reporting By James Mackenzie; Editing by Dan Lalor)	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	3	3	1	2	2	2	2	2	4
632	venus-bright-star-shine-together-dawn-wednesday-114201625	Early-bird skywatchers on Wednesday (Oct. 3) will be treated to a rather extraordinary sight, when the most brilliant planet passes exceptionally close to one of the brightest stars in the sky.The planet is Venus and the star is Regulus in the constellation of Leo, the Lion. The celestial pair promises to dazzle observers before dawn on Wednesday, weather permitting.Venus is by far and away the brightest morning "star" and is currently the focal point of the eastern dawn sky. It will, in fact, remain this way all through the balance of the autumn season. Venus rises a bit more than three hours before sunrise — that’s even before the first light of dawn.In the days and weeks to come, early risers can take note of the fact that Venus will slowly be appearing lower, and a bit less brilliant, in the night sky. Even now, the planet appears ever so slightly lower and less dazzling than it did September, but this astonishingly bright planet is still positioned almost as well as it can be for a predawn apparition. [October's Night Sky Sights (Sky Maps)]At present, Venus glows just to the west (right) of the famous backwards question-mark pattern of stars known as the "Sickle of Leo" and is poised above and to the right of Leo's "lucida" – its brightest star – the bluish first magnitude star, Regulus. But because Venus is moving at just over a degree per day to the east, the space between them will rapidly close in the coming mornings. (Your closed fist held at arm's length covers about 10 degrees of the sky.)On Wednesday morning, as viewed from the U.S. East Coast, Venus will slide as little as 7.5 minutes of arc to the south of Regulus. To give you some idea of how small this is, it is only one-fourth the apparent width of a full moon or one-eighth of a degree.By the time Venus and Regulus have risen for the West Coast, the gap separating the two will have widened to 12 minutes of arc. That’s equal to the separation between Mizar and Alcor, the double star that marks the bend in the handle of the Big Dipper. Astronomy guides often state that if you can spy Alcor next to the brighter Mizar without optical aid, that you have normal vision.But seeing Regulus so close to Venus on Wednesday morning may be more of a challenge because of Venus' overpowering brilliance. Binoculars will no doubt prove to be a great assistance in viewing this, as Venus is now shining at magnitude -4.1, compared to bluish Regulus at magnitude +1.3 (the lower the number, the brighter the object). Converting this 5.4-magnitude difference into a ratio, we find that Regulus — one of the 21 brightest stars in the sky — shines only 1/158th as bright as Venus!Editor's note: If you snap an amazing photo of Venus and Regulus, and you'd like to share for a possible story or image gallery, send image and details (including location info) to managing editor Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com.Joe Rao serves as an instructor and guest lecturer at New York's Hayden Planetarium.

634	victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Space shuttle Endeavour rocketed beyond Earth orbit 25 times. Its 26th mission: A 12-mile commute through the streets of Los Angeles to its new retirement home in a museum.With Endeavour permanently on the ground after a majestic aerial spin Friday around California, crews over the weekend will begin unbolting the shuttle from the 747 jumbo jet and putting it on a special flatbed trailer, a process that will take a few weeks.The road trip in early October to the California Science Center has been billed as a parade, but some residents along the route have objected to the cutting down of some 400 trees to make room for the five-story-high shuttle with a 78-foot wingspan.A crowd recently packed a public meeting where concerns were raised about the loss of shade and greenery in their neighborhoods. Museum officials have pledged to replant at least double the number of lost trees.But Friday brought nothing but good feelings as the shuttle became California's biggest star, the people its paparazzi.From the state Capitol to the Golden Gate Bridge to the Hollywood sign, massive crowds of spectators pointed their cellphones and cameras skyward as the shuttle, riding piggyback atop a 747 jumbo jet, buzzed past.Peggy Burke was among the hordes of camera-toting tourists who jammed the waterfront along the San Francisco Bay, reflecting on the end of an era."It's just a shame that the program has to end, but I'm so glad they came to the Bay area especially over the Golden Gate Bridge," she said. "Onward to Mars."At the Hollywood & Highland Center, a shopping complex with a view of the Hollywood sign, revelers yelled and screamed."It was like being in Times Square for the millennium," said Blue Fier, a college photography professor. "This is right up there. It was pretty cool."Known as the baby shuttle, Endeavour replaced Challenger, which exploded during liftoff in 1986. Endeavour rolled off the assembly line in the Mojave Desert in 1991 and a year later, rocketed to space. It left Earth 25 times, logging 123 million miles.Friday's high-flying tour was a homecoming of sorts.After a nearly five-hour loop that took Endeavour over some of the state's most treasured landmarks, it turned for its final approach, coasting down the runway on the south side of the Los Angeles International Airport, where elected officials and VIPs gathered for an arrival ceremony.As the jumbo jet taxied to the hangar, an American flag popped out of the jet's hatch. Endeavour will stay at the airport for several weeks as crew prepare it for its 12-mile trek through city streets to the California Science Center, its new permanent home, where it will go on display Oct. 30.NASA retired the shuttle fleet last year to focus on destinations beyond low-Earth orbit. Before Endeavour was grounded for good, Californians were treated to an aerial farewell.Endeavour took off from Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave desert Friday after an emotional cross-country ferry flight that made a special flyover of Tucson, Ariz., to honor its last commander, Mark Kelly, and his wife, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.It circled the high desert that gave birth to the shuttle fleet before veering to Northern California. After looping twice around the state Capitol, it swung over to the San Francisco Bay area and Silicon Valley and then headed down the coast, entering the Los Angeles air space over the Santa Monica Pier. En route to LAX, it passed over a slew of tourist sites including Dodger Stadium, Disneyland and the Queen Mary.The cost for shipping and handling Endeavour was estimated at $28 million, to be paid for by the science center. NASA officials have said there was no extra charge to fly over Tucson because it was on the way.Endeavor's carefully choreographed victory lap was by far the most elaborate of the surviving shuttle fleet. Discovery is home at the Smithsonian Institution's hangar in Virginia after flying over the White House and National Mall. Atlantis will remain in Florida, where it will be towed a short distance to the Kennedy Space Center's visitor center in the fall.Derek Reynolds, a patent attorney from a Sacramento suburb who saw the last shuttle launch last year, felt the flyover in Sacramento was a rare opportunity to share a firsthand experience of the space program with his 5-year-old son, Jack, who he pulled out of kindergarten for the day."I want him to experience it and give him the memory since it's the last one," Reynolds said.As Endeavour approached LAX, other airplanes were forced to circle and wait. Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Miami snapped pictures and shot video out their windows as the shuttle arrived."This was a once-in-a-lifetime event," said pilot Doug Causey, who has been flying for 29 years. "That was a real treat to see something like that."___Contributing to this report were Associated Press staff members Tom Verdin and Juliet Williams in Sacramento; Terry Chea and Marcio Sanchez in San Francisco; John Antczak in Pasadena; Jae Hong in Santa Monica; and Greg Risling, Martha Mendoza, Raquel Maria Dillon, Richard Vogel and Chris Carlson in Los Angeles.___Alicia Chang can be followed at http://twitter.com/SciWriAlicia	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	2	2	3	4	3

636	vodafone-says-cost-500-million-sterling-fix-cww-142355564--finance	LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone Group said it would cost about 500 million pounds ($807 million) to fix Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) over the next four years but the payback by 2016 from the acquisition would be bigger than some analysts expected.The mobile operator bought CWW for a total 1.31 billion pounds in July in a deal that doubled its business with British companies and provided it with UK and international networks to increase its capacity to manage data growth.It said on Thursday that it expected the business to deliver cash flow synergies of 150-200 million pounds a year by March 2016, resulting in an operating free cash flow contribution for the group in that year of 250-300 million pounds.Its first priority, however, was stabilising CWW, which had long suffered from under-investment in its networks and customer service, with roughly 60 percent of the money earmarked for integration to be spent in the first 18 months.CWW's Chief Executive Nick Jeffery, who ran Vodafone's global enterprise division until July, said CWW's revenues would continue the downward trend of the last three years until 2014."It just takes a long time for this ship to turn around, and it's that we see taking 18 months to two years," he said.Longer term, however, the opportunity to provide combined telecom and IT services to companies - one of the main rationales for the deal - was better than Vodafone expected."We are seeing many customers from both companies knocking on our door for a converged fixed- mobile-hosted application offer," Chief Technology Officer Steve Pusey said.The deal also gives Vodafone a 20,000-kilometre fibre network, relieving pressure on its network as data traffic from demand for services like video and reducing its bill for renting fixed line capacity from third parties like BT.CWW's 425,000-kilometre international network would also be used to handle part of Vodafone's international traffic, the company said.The Cable & Wireless name will live on in Britain for another couple of years, Vodafone said, while it improved the group's reputation."We need to fix some things before we're happy to put our logo above the front door," the company's UK Chief Executive Guy Lawrence said at an investor event.Analysts at Espirito Santo Investment Bank said the cash flow target was ahead of their estimates, as was the synergy range of 150-200 million pounds - they had 160 million."The disappointment will be the length of time that it takes for Vodafone to achieve these cash flow benefits - March 2016 is more than three and a half years after the deal completed," they said.Shares in Vodafone were 0.3 percent lower at 176.9 pence by 1332 GMT.($1=0.6193 British pounds)(Editing by Mike Nesbit)	4	4	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	2	2	1	1	1	3	4

638	watch-closely-virus-related-sars-093842037	LONDON (AP) — Global health officials have alerted doctors to be on the lookout for new cases of a virus related to SARS but said there was no sign the disease was behaving like the killer respiratory syndrome that killed hundreds in 2003.Earlier this week, the World Health Organization announced the new coronavirus had been found in a critically ill Qatari man being treated in London as well as in a Saudi Arabian man who died several months earlier. Genetic sequencing found the viruses in the two men to be nearly identical.Gregory Hartl, a WHO spokesman, said Thursday the two might have been infected directly by animals and there was no indication of human to human spread.The new coronavirus is from a family of viruses that cause the common cold as well as SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome that killed about 800 people, mostly in Asia in a 2003 epidemic. SARS jumped to people from civet cats and then mutated into a form easily spread among humans.Unlike SARS, the new virus also causes rapid kidney failure, a complication not usually seen in respiratory viruses. In London, the Qatari patient is in critical but stable condition and is being treated with an artificial lung machine.Hartl said WHO is monitoring reports of suspect cases of the new virus but none have so far been confirmed. Britain's Health Protection Agency said a small number of potential cases were being evaluated. On Wednesday, Danish authorities ruled out a handful of cases in people who had recently been in Saudi Arabia and Qatar hospitalized with flu-like symptoms.WHO also issued a case definition for the new virus to help doctors spot cases early. The agency advised them to investigate any patients hospitalized with acute respiratory syndrome not explained by other causes who had close contact with probable or confirmed cases or had recently traveled to Saudi Arabia or Qatar.Saudi officials said they were concerned that the next month's annual Muslim pilgrimage of Hajj could provide more opportunities for the virus to spread. They advised pilgrims to keep their hands clean and wear masks in crowded places.	3	4	2	4	3	3	4	3	3	2	3	1	1	4	3	4

640	westwood-makes-poulter-pay-eyes-americans-next-213536049--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - Lee Westwood made team mate Ian Poulter empty his wallet after a practice-round beating and felt confident he could keep up the good form for Europe against the Americans at this week's Ryder Cup.Westwood and Luke Donald thrashed fellow Britons Ian Poulter and Justin Rose on Tuesday on the Medinah course where the Ryder Cup opens Friday and the winning duo were a splendid 13 under while playing a best ball format."It was only a practice round on the first day," Westwood, who could not help but break into a smile, told reporters on Wednesday. "I wouldn't read too much into it. We came out fast and we were just way too good for Ian and Justin. And they are a lot lighter this morning in their pockets."Donald, who paired with Westwood two years ago at Celtic Manor to hammer Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker 6 & 5 in four-balls, said he enjoyed reuniting with Westwood."It's always pleasing when you're able to take cash out of Poulter's wallet. A few months fell out at the same time, but it was fun," Donald joked on Wednesday. "We both played well. We certainly have a good chemistry between us."Westwood struggled in Sunday's final round at the Tour Championship, finishing last in the 30-man field after a final-round 74, but was full of confidence after his practice play.The Medinah Country Club course has been shorn clean of tangly rough to encourage big-hitting U.S. players to lash out off the tee, but straight-driving Westwood said finding fairways was always an advantage."I've played here pretty much all year, and I haven't seen a golf course that's had no rough and no rough around the greens," Westwood said about the tracks on the U.S. tour."This is not a golf course that either team is particularly used to, and I can't see how it suits one team or the other to be perfectly honest."I would say that the last time I played a golf course set up like this with no rough around the greens and no rough down the side of the fairways was The Belfry in 2002, and we set that up for ourselves."Westwood said with dry conditions and no rain in the forecast for the biennial event, stopping balls on quickening greens would be far easier from the fairway."I think there's still a big advantage. It was certainly yesterday," he said. "I felt there was a big advantage to hitting the fairways still."The greens are not going to get any softer. They will firm up. It will be an advantage to hit fairways. Always is."(Editing by Frank Pingue)	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	3	2	3	2	2	2	3	3
641	why-doctors-trust-gut-diagnosing-kids-192521763	Doctors who treat children see scores of kids with minor illnesses every day, but serious infections are rare. When such illnesses strike, children greatly benefit from having their illnesses diagnosed early, but often, the early signs are missed.One way that to ensure that children with serious infections are treated quickly is for doctors to heed their "gut feelings" in assessing the children's behavior, according to a new study from Belgium.The study showed that in two out of six cases where a child had a serious infection, but didn't have the clinical red-flag signs of one, the doctor had a gut feeling that something was wrong."Gut feelings should not be ignored, but used in decision-making," the researchers wrote in their study, published Tuesday (Sept .25) in the journal BMJ.Dr. Robert Chun, an assistant professor at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, said, "You have to have what I call 'a healthy amount of paranoia.' You cannot miss something that could hurt them for their life."All kids — from those with the most severe physical or mental delays, to the most advanced children — give off signs when something is wrong beyond what their lab results may show, he said.Where gut feelings come fromPrimary care physicians often see children with serious illnesses when their symptoms have yet to develop in measurable terms, according to the study.Chun said that doctors with experience treating children know that those who are acting lethargic or tired, despite having normal lab results, are cause for concern.In the study, the researchers considered the cases of 3,890 children who were seen by primary care doctors for illnesses they had had for less than five days. Doctors were asked whether they had a gut feeling, beyond the child's symptoms, that the child was seriously ill.It turned out that 21 of the children were admitted to the hospital with serious infections, such as pneumonia or meningitis. Six of these children had not been referred immediately to the hospital, because in their initial visit with the doctor, their clinical signs didn’t warrant it. In two of these cases, doctors had indicated they had gut feelings that something was wrong.But such feelings can also be wrong. In the study, doctors had gut feelings in 44 cases where those feelings turned out to be a false alarm.Chun said that number of false alarms is not a reason to ignore the case where gut feelings were correct."No one remembers the kid that you suspected, that turned out to be fine," he said. "But every one remembers the things you didn't look into — those are the ones that haunt you."The role of parentsIn the study, the researchers attempted to learn more about the basis for gut feelings by asking doctors exactly what prompted their uneasiness. They found that gut feelings were most likely to arise when a child had a history of convulsions.Additionally, gut feelings were strongly influenced by parents' concerns about their child's illness.Chun said, "When a child is lethargic, when the parents say, 'this is unusual,' as a clinician, you need to have a enough humility to know that even those all the lab numbers are normal, you need to look closer, and be more anxious."In fact, Chun recently treated a 5-year-old boy with a rare infection of necrotizing fasciitis (sometimes called flesh-eating bacteria), and parental intuition played a role in the case. "Moms and dads know their kid, they know that something's not right," he said."There's nothing scientific about this," he said, adding that a more objective way to diagnose rare infections would certainly be desirable. Getting second opinions from colleagues can help.But in the meantime, "when you have that feeling, you have to investigate further," he said.Pass it on: Doctors' gut feelings may help diagnose children's rare infections, a new study suggests.FollowMyHealthNewsDaily on Twitter @MyHealth_MHND.

642	why-investors-still-arent-sold-iphone-5-4-131800906	Apple has announced that it sold 5 million iPhone 5 units over the weekend, crushing the previous record of 4 million set by the iPhone 4S in 2011. One would think Wall Street would embrace this news from the world's most valuable company, right? Think again. Investors aren't impressed by the sales figures, and Apple's shares have tumbled from their $700-plus price on Friday, bottoming out near $685 Monday. Why aren't investors sold on the well-received, record-breaking handset? Here, four theories:1. Analysts expected much moreForecasters predicted bigger, better things for the iPhone 5. Apple analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jeffreys went on record with an estimate between 6 to 10 million, settling on a conservative 8 million after seeing long lines of eager fans on launch day. In fact, says Jay Yarow at Business Insider, "Munster called 6 million a 'worst case scenario.' So, this is worse than a worst case scenario." Wall Street is responding accordingly.SEE ALSO: Coming soon: A leather jacket grown in a lab?2. The pre-orders were misleadingOn Saturday, Apple announced that 2 million people had pre-ordered the iPhone 5, more than doubling pre-orders for the iPhone 4S. The encouraging early figures emboldened analysts to boost their predictions, except "obviously, the weekend sales didn't follow the same pattern as the pre-orders," says Yarow.3. The iPhone 5 had more ground to coverSales of the iPhone 5 were only about one million units higher than opening weekend sales of the iPhone 4S, says Seth Flegerman at Mashable. But "when you normalize the number of countries in which the phones were available over opening weekend," says ASYMCO analyst Horace Dediu, the iPhone 5 sold at "roughly the same rate as the iPhone 4S." So even though it smashed the old record, the figures aren't nearly as impressive as they seem.SEE ALSO: Can a browser-based Spotify conquer online music?4. Apple's buggy Maps App raises bigger concerns The release of such a "flawed product" like Apple Maps with iOS 6 would have worried former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, says Dan Radovsky at Daily Finance. Not so, it seems, his successor Tim Cook. That has investors concerned. It was a "strategic gamble on the part of Apple, to knowingly foist a poor product onto its loyal customer base" just to rid its mobile products of Google's presence. And when consumers suffer, that's bad news all around.View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	2	3	3	1	1	3	4
643	why-seats-coming-loose-american-airlines-planes-160000973	American Airlines passengers are pretty rattled... literally. Over a span of three days, rows of seats have come loose on three of the airline's Boeing 757 jets — in mid-air. The airline says it will inspect eight other 757s with similar seats to make sure they don't have problems. The Federal Aviation Administration is also investigating. But what exactly going on with these planes? Here, a brief guide:What happened on these planes?While the jets were in flight, a row of seats on each of the planes — one going from Vail, Colo., to Dallas, one from Boston to Miami, and another from New York to Miami — came loose and tipped over. "The seats flipped backwards," one passenger tells ABC News, "and so people were essentially on the laps of the people behind them with their legs up in the air." Two of the flights made emergency landings just to be safe. Nobody was hurt in any of the incidents.How did the seats come loose? They either came out of the tracks used to secure them to the cabin floor, or the tracks themselves came unbolted. Travel experts said they couldn't remember such a thing happening once, much less three times in rapid succession. "This should not have happened," says Mark Rosenker, a travel analyst for CBS News. "These seats are designed to withstand a great deal of force, and they're not supposed to come off their tracks."What went wrong?There are plenty of possibilities: Defective hardware, shoddy maintenance — even tampering can't necessarily be ruled out. The airline's union employees have protested pending layoffs and pay cuts imposed since American filed for bankruptcy protection last year, and executives have accused some pilots of illegally slowing down work and causing a spike in flight delays. In this case, however, the airline is adamant that the incidents were caused by a maintenance problem, not intentional tampering. "It could be sabotage or it could be just sloppiness," George Hobica of Airfarewatchdog.com tells ABC News. "Either way, it's a disaster for the airline."Is this really that big of a deal?Travel industry experts say the slightest safety concern could be devastating, especially for a struggling airline. If travelers suspect lax maintenance is to blame, says travel analyst Henry Harteveldt, then "passengers will start booking away from American Airlines in droves. This is very serious stuff." Safety is everything, Hobica says. "With a delay or cancelation, you're sitting on the ground," he says. "(With loose seats) if the plane hits turbulence, people go flying."Sources: ABC News, Associated Press, CBS News, Christian Science MonitorView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	2	2	3	3	4	4	2	2	3	2	4	3	1	3	3	4

645	wiresurfer-launches-online-telecom-price-comparison-market-040259459--sector	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Inspired by travel sites like Expedia, start-up Wiresurfer.com is promising to condense three days work into fifteen minutes for small companies shopping for telecommunications services.The Coral Springs, Florida based company, is launching its website on Tuesday where small and medium sized businesses can compare prices for telephone and Internet services and see what promotions are on offer in their region.Businesses can then order their service via Wiresurfer, which has signed up about fifteen telecom partners including AT&T Inc, Comcast, CenturyLink Inc, EarthLink Inc and Windstream Corp.The idea is that choosing a telecom provider would be made as easy as booking a flight online.Wiresurfer Chief Executive and co-founder Jeff Kaufman expects big demand for a service that makes procuring telecom services less time consuming.Small businesses often have to spend up to three days trawling through the websites of multiple phone companies and then calling the companies individually to find the best deals, he said."The process of actually shopping for telecommunications services even at the small business level is complex," said Kaufman, "It's a giant time suck."The phone companies have agreed to pay Wiresurfer a portion of each customer's phone bill for the duration of their contract with payments ranging from 14 percent to 25 percent of the phone bill, Kaufman said.With a target market of 50 million U.S. small businesses, Kaufman said he hopes to break even about eight months after launch and to have over 16,000 customers within about 30 months.In the meantime, the company said it has an angel investment of $200,000 from Nantucket based entrepreneur Alan Bankart. It is also seeking a round of venture capital funding.If the service takes off then the business telecom services market could potentially become more competitive, according to Gartner analyst Tiffani Bova, who follows technology and telecom sales channels around the world."If you look at other industries that have had an online marketplace aggregate multiple suppliers they have resulted in creating a much more competitive market," Bova said referring to the travel, hotel and insurance industries.Even though telecom contracts come up for renewal only once every year or two, Bova argued that even if Wiresurfer gains just a small part of the market it could have a solid business."There's lots of room here," the analyst said.(Reporting By Sinead Carew; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)	4	4	4	4	3	3	2	3	3	3	3	2	3	1	3	3

When a 58-year-old woman in Trumbull, Connecticut brought back her large collection of overdue books, she was promptly handcuffed. Police arrested Nancy Harris on one count of fifth-degree larceny after public library director July Bernadette Baldino complained to local officers that Harris had amassed 121 books, magazines and DVDs from the Trumbull library and two nearby branches, worth over $3,000. Harris gained access to the materials through her position as a Trumbull library assistant. She returned all but 25 of the items and protested the arrest, saying, "I don't have any books from the Easton library or any other library."

If your knowledge of Indian English literature doesn't extend beyond Salman Rushdie or Jhumpa Lahiri, you've got some catching up to do.

Now a new wave of talent has arrived." writes Keith Meatto, in an overview of contemporary English fiction by writers of Indian descent. Authors name-checked in the piece include short story writers Rajesh Parameswaran and Tania James, Gods Without Men novelist Hari Kunzru, Booker winner Arundhati Roy, Booker shortlister Jeet Thayil and Aravind Adiga, author of The White Tiger. But even with this embarrassment of literary riches, Meatto worries about how readers will understand the wave of recent Indian fiction written in English.

647	woman-sentenced-faking-cancer-raise-cash-175426463	PHOENIX (AP) — A Phoenix woman who pretended to have cancer in order to raise money for breast implants has been sentenced to a year in jail and three years of probation.Court spokesman Kelly Vail says 27-year-old Jami Lynn Toler was sentenced Wednesday. She pleaded guilty in August to a theft charge in a plea agreement.Authorities say Toler helped organize fundraisers and collected more than $8,000 beginning last September. Medical records obtained by Mesa police show she didn't have cancer and paid a plastic surgeon with the cash.Court Commissioner Brian Kaiser also ordered Toler to pay restitution.Police reports show Toler told her former boss she needed a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction but was uninsured. She told the same story to her mother and grandparents.	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	2	2	1	2	2	2	2	3	4
648	woman-tourettes-says-biscuit-16-000-times-day-002006414--abc-news-health	Jessica Thom, a sassy and smart 32-year-old from London, says the word "biscuit" 16,000 times a day. She also involuntarily bangs her head against the wall, beats her chest and when least expected, lets out a guttural sound or swears.She describes her love-hate relationship with the disabling disorder Tourette syndrome in a new diary-style memoir -- "Welcome to Biscuit Land: A Year in the Life of Touretteshero," available in October.In Britain, "biscuit" means "cookie," but Thom insists she is never really thinking about eating when she has her involuntary outbursts. Her brother-in-law recently took note of her verbal tic and counted her saying it 16 times a minute, or about 900 times an hour.In one day alone, she has hit herself on the forehead with a phone, a carton of apple juice, a set of keys, a toilet roll and a strawberry.Thom said that for years she viewed Tourette's as a liability, but now she sees it as a strength. Comparing herself to the film character Bridget Jones, who laughed at her quirks and foibles, Thom recounts hilarious, but also heartbreaking stories of her encounters with a world not used to her social outbursts."I know I tic all the time and it sort of pisses me off -- biscuit, biscuit," Thom told ABCNews.com. "But if I paid attention to it all the time, I wouldn't get much done. Sometimes with the Tourette's, I get overloaded -- biscuit, biscuit. I'll punch myself in the chest hundreds of times a day and my legs move erratically about.""The challenges are dreadful, but it has helped make me a more resilient and empathetic person," she said. "You can overcome most things, and I have become more confident."Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder that is defined by multiple motor and vocal tics lasting for more than one year, according to the National Tourette Syndrome Foundation. The verbal tics can include grunting, throat clearing, shouting and barking.It was named for a French neuropsychiatrist, Gilles de la Tourette, who assessed the disorder in the late 1800s. He did not have the disorder, so it is "Tourette," but colloquially, it's called "Tourette's."The first symptoms, usually before the age of 18, are involuntary movements of the face, arms, limbs or trunk, such as kicking or stomping. They are frequent, repetitive and rapid. The patient cannot control these movements and they can involve the whole body.Fewer than 10 percent of all patients swear or use socially inappropriate words.Thom is "clearly an outlier," according to Dr. Jonathan Mink, chief of pediatric neurology at Rochester University, who sits on the board of the Tourette association. "She is atypical and at the extreme end of the spectrum.""She is probably not thinking 'biscuit' all the time," said Mink, who does not treat Thom. "It's kind of an urge of need to do it. A lot of people say it's like an itch that needs to be scratched."He estimates one in 100 children has some degree of Tourette syndrome, a disorder that is little understood and whose cause likely has a genetic link.Many patients also have symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder."The majority of kids, even those bad enough to seek treatment, are likely to have their tics diminish or go away," said Mink.Habit reversal therapy -- teaching a person with Tourette's to hold their breath, for example, instead of saying the repeated word, can sometimes help. Antidepressants are used to treat associated anxiety.Thom, who has had tics since she was six, has used both therapies, but no avail."I tried instead of banging my chest to try to stretch my arm out, but it didn't work for me," she said.Thom does take muscle relaxants but other medications have caused undesirable side effects.She writes that the physical tics make her feel "a bit like suddenly being wrenched from the inside or as if someone's put itching powder in my blood."Thom lives with a roommate, but she concedes there is still "quite a lot of risk." She recently fell in the shower and now uses a wheelchair.The intensity of the disorder "fluctuates and changes," according to Thom. "Just when you think you got one thing set with your tics, something else comes up."She recognizes that uncontrollable swearing can cause problems on her job. Thom works on the Young Children's Project in fundraising and development."There are people who would argue that exposing children to bad language is not acceptable," she writes. "But I reckon children who are old enough to recognize a swear word are also old enough to understand that I've not chosen to swear, and that it isn't OK for them to do it."About two years ago her tic intensified; sometimes she can lose her language altogether. But a telephone interview with ABCNews.com went smoothly. Thoms is eloquent, despite numerous "biscuits" and the occasional whooping sound.The world has not been so empathetic with Thom. She writes about asking a staff member for directions at a London subway station: "He ignored me, so I asked again, but he turned his back on me."I explained that I had Tourette's, that if I was swearing or making unusual movements they were not directed at him and that I just needed information. He looked at me and said, 'I'm not giving you any f***ing information.'"In the end, he just walked away. But when her transport pass didn't work, she had to approach him again for help. "He said he would -- when I stopped swearing."Thom burst into tears and with the help of a woman, she was able to leave the station and get a taxi home.But Thom understands why people are uncomfortable with Tourette syndrome. "There are a lot of myths about it," she said. "They are frightened by it and the public response is in ignorance or fear. They hear the noises or moving around erratically. They laugh at me because they are uncomfortable."At the same time, Thom says she has experienced "incredible kindnesses" from strangers who took the time to engage with her and listen.The cab driver who took her home that night understood when Thom explained she had Tourette's. "You've got Tourette's," he told her. "My best mate of 20 years has Tourette's. You're in the right cab."A friend, Matthew Pountney, changed her life when the two founded the website Touretteshero and she began to see the "humor and creativity" in her condition.Pountney described her tics as a "crazy language generating machine.""He said if I was not doing something creative as a result, it would be wasteful," said Thom. "I had never thought of it in those terms."How her brain chooses her tics are a "complete mystery," according to Thom. "Sometimes strange ideas come together that would not normally be put together that are visual and interesting."Some of her favorites are: "Capital letters talk to themselves at night." Or "Fingers on buzzards." Or even "Hands up, Action Man."Her website attracts others with Tourette's and writing for them [and herself] has helped Thom "reframe" the negative aspects of her disorder."Previously, I would get angry or upset," she said. "But writing meant time spent thinking about yourself and developing language to explain to other people. It was incredibly powerful."Today, mostly because of helping others on her website and writing, Thom is more accepting of herself."For I long time, I struggled -- if I just tried a little harder or concentrated more, I could catch that tic," she said. "I look at a close friend [who has Tourette syndrome] and I can see her tic and recognize that feeling in my body and how it looks from the outside. Never for a moment do I expect her to control that, so I am more patient with myself."And the writing itself now gives Thom joy."It's very healing not censoring myself," she said. "One of the things that surprised me about writing was having the chance to articulate my thoughts and share my experiences ... I am able to communicate my thoughts without being interrupted."	3	2	2	3	4	3	2	3	3	2	4	4	3	3	4	4
649	woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf	MEDINAH, Illinois (Reuters) - Tiger Woods may be the greatest golfer of his generation but at the Ryder Cup he has been Joe Average and on Tuesday accepted responsibility for the dismal U.S. showing for the past 15 years.During a period where Woods reigned supreme over the golf world winning 74 PGA Tour titles, including 14 majors, he has been unable to extend his dominance to the biennial competition that pits the U.S. best against Europe's best.A mediocre 13-14-2 mark from six Ryder Cups does not enhance the brilliance resume of Woods, who has been able to celebrate just one team win from six Ryder Cup appearances.Woods's struggles have coincided with lean times for the U.S. with Europe hoisting the Cup in six of the last eight events."Well, certainly I am responsible for that because I didn't earn the points that I was put out there for," Woods told reporters. "I believe I was out there, what, in five sessions each time and I didn't go 5-0 on our side."So I certainly am a part of that and that's part of being a team. I needed to go get my points for my team and I didn't do that."Hopefully I can do that this week, and hopefully the other guys can do the same and we can get this thing rolling."Medinah Country Club, which will serve as the scene for this week's 39th U.S.-Europe showdown, represents a great chance for Woods to improve his record.Medinah has been a happy hunting ground for the 36-year-old American, who picked up two of his 14 majors at the stately tree-lined layout with victories at the 1999 and 2006 PGA Championships."I've always loved coming here," said Woods, who is also a five-time winner of the PGA Tour event at nearby Cog Hill. "I enjoy playing in Chicago and for some reason, I've just had a lot of success here."I don't know what it is but I seem to be very, very comfortable here."There have been differing theories behind why Woods has not been able to impose his will on the Ryder Cup in the same fashion he has been able to in PGA Tour events.Graeme McDowell, a U.S. Open winner and three-time member of the European team, believes that for much of Woods's career he has played with a target on his back. The same bull's-eye current world number one Rory McIlroy will have painted on his golf shirt this week."I kind of liken it to playing premiership football, the biggest teams, the Manchester Uniteds, the Liverpools, the Chelseas, the Arsenals," explained McDowell."Any lesser team that comes to play these guys, they have a tendency to raise their game because it's a huge game for an underdog to play a Tiger Woods."They get up for it. They are not expected to win."Finding the right playing partner for Woods, who is back close to his best form winning three PGA Tour events this year, has always proven a bit of puzzle for U.S. captains.His singles record of 4-1-1 is impressive, but he does not play well with others as marks of 4-7-1 in foursomes and 5-6-0 in four ball suggest.In golf's version of speed dating, Woods has been set up with just about everyone but has yet to find someone he truly clicks with.At Oakland Hills in Michigan in 2004, captain Hal Sutton played the ultimate hunch matching Woods with long-time rival Phil Mickelson in a partnership that failed miserably.More recently, Woods has seen duty with the ever steady and unflappable Jim Furyk and found some success with the quiet and humble Steve Stricker, one of the best putters on the PGA Tour.This time it will be up to captain Davis Love III, who has partnered Woods as a player, to find the perfect match for the world number two."Tiger can play great and his partner not play well, or the other team play extremely well," said Love. "Somebody has to play in Tiger's bubble and I think that's the challenge."Steve Stricker has found his way into that pairing because he can handle everything that's going on around Tiger."It's easier to play with Dustin (Johnson) probably or it's easier to play with Jim Furyk than it is to pair a guy with Tiger because you get the extra attention and the extra pressure."(Editing by Larry Fine)	4	4	4	4	5	4	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	2	4	
650	workday-sets-ipo-terms-valuing-company-3-85-122714503--sector	(Reuters) - Workday Inc, which provides cloud-based human resource software, said it plans to price its initial public offering of Class A shares at between $21 and $24 each, valuing the Silicon Valley company at up to $3.85 billion.Workday was co-founded by ex-PeopleSoft executives David Duffield and Aneel Bhusri, who left PeopleSoft following its acquisition by Oracle Corp in 2004. It confidentially filed for an IPO in July under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.The Act allows a company to keep financial details contained in IPO documents private for longer and permits it to keep its registration statement confidential until 21 days prior to the first road show. The company subsequently filed in August to raise up to $400 million in its IPO.Workday is looking to sell 22.75 million Class A shares in the offering. At the mid-point of Workday's expected range, the offering will raise about $512 million.A dual-class share structure -- which allows owners to retain control even after selling a large stake -- has been used by a number of tech startups and was recently seen in the IPO of English soccer team Manchester United.Workday's Class A and Class B shares are identical, except for voting and conversion rights. Each Class A share is entitled to one vote while each Class B share is entitled to ten votes and is convertible into a Class A share at any time.Duffield and Bhusri, together with their affiliates, will hold about 67 percent of the voting rights after the offering, the company said in a filing.The company, which is also backed by private equity firm Greylock Partners, listed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as the lead underwriters for the offering.Workday's Class A shares, which have been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "WDAY", are scheduled to be priced on October 11, an underwriter said.(Reporting by Aman Shah in Bangalore; Editing by Sreejiraj Eluvangal)	3	4	3	3	4	2	3	3	3	4	2	1	1	1	3	4
651	world-stocks-fall-weak-japan-china-indicators-090557776--finance	BANGKOK (AP) — World stock markets turned lower Thursday after weak Japanese trade figures and a contraction in Chinese manufacturing underlined that the global economy continues to struggle.The Japanese data showed that the country's powerhouse export sector was continuing to suffer the effects of a slowdown in Europe and elsewhere. Exports in August totaled 5.05 trillion yen ($64.33 billion), down 5.8 percent from a year earlier. Imports were also down. Exports to Europe sank 28 percent.The economic news from China wasn't any better. A private survey of manufacturers showed that activity fell again in September, though at a slightly slower pace than August.European stocks fell in early trading. Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.7 percent to 5,849.66. Germany's DAX slipped 0.3 percent to 7,370.29 and France's CAC-40 lost 0.4 percent to 3,518.15.Wall Street futures also fell. Dow Jones industrial futures lost 0.3 percent to 13,462 while S&P 500 futures slid 0.3 percent to 1,448.80.The losses in Asia were more acute. Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped 1.6 percent to close at 9,086.98. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.9 percent to 1,990.33 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.2 percent to 20,590.92. Benchmarks in Singapore, Taiwan and Indonesia also fell. New Zealand's bucked the trend and rose.In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 2.1 percent to 2,024.84, the lowest closing in more than three years. The Shenzhen Composite Index lost almost 3 percent to 840.21.Asian stocks had rallied a day before, after the Bank of Japan announced an aggressive monetary easing program in an attempt to spur growth and counter the strength of the Japanese yen.But the market impact of the Bank of Japan's move was short-lived, a possible sign that investors are getting stimulus-weary. The move came days after the U.S. Federal Reserve revealed it will purchase an average of $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a month until the economy shows significant improvement.Andrew Sullivan, principal sales trader at Piper Jaffray in Hong Kong, said in an email that it was "disappointing that the initial rally on the BOJ stimulus did not hold."Markets also didn't get much encouragement from the release of preliminary manufacturing data out of China for September. The HSBC Flash Purchasing Managers' Index stood at 47.8 for the month out of a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 indicate contraction.Still, the figure was an improvement over August's 47.6 level, suggesting that the slowdown may be stabilizing."It showed the decline has slowed down," said Francis Lun, managing director of Lyncean Holdings in Hong Kong. "The problem is with Europe and America. Except for the iPhone, nothing is selling."Japanese export stocks took a beating, as the yen bounced back from a brief drop sparked by the central bank's announcement Wednesday. Mazda Motor Corp. plummeted 4.8 percent and Yamaha Motor Co. lost 3.8 percent. Sony Corp. shed 4.6 percent.Australian surf wear retailer Billabong International plunged 7.3 percent after saying that a private equity firm that had been looking to make a takeover bid for company had pulled out.Benchmark oil for October delivery was down 54 cents to $91.44 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract for crude fell $3.31 to finish at $91.98 per barrel on the Nymex on Wednesday.In currencies, the euro fell to $1.2970 from $1.3063 late Wednesday in New York. The dollar fell to 78.22 yen from 78.39 yen.	3	3	3	3	4	3	2	3	2	2	2	1	1	1	3	4
652	york-city-schools-plan-b-morning-pill-teens-160327788--abc-news-health	The pilot program that allows teens to access the contraceptive drug Plan B in 13 New York City schools -- perhaps the first of its kind in the country -- may be eventually implemented citywide.According to the city's Board of Health, parents can "opt out" of the program, but only 1 to 2 percent has chosen to do so."The proof is in the pudding," said health department spokesman Chanel Caraway. "Overall, this suggests that parents are OK with the service being available to their children."Last year, when the plan was implemented, about 4.7 percent of the 12,000 girls enrolled in those schools was given the prescription drug, according to the Board of Health. Students ranged in age from 14 to 18.This year, the program was expanded from five to 13 schools, and Caraway said they intend to continue expanding to eventually cover all of the city's public schools.Plan B, also known as the "morning after" pill, works in a similar way to birth control pills, except it is taken after sex to prevent an unplanned pregnancy, according to its manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals. The pill should be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours of unprotected sex or birth control failure.Plan B should not "affect or terminate" an existing pregnancy, according to the company's advertising.New York City's pilot program, Connecting Adolescents To Comprehensive Health or CATCH, is aimed at stemming the teen pregnancy rate, which causes many girls to leave school.Teen pregnancy rates dropped 25 percent in the city between 2001 and 2010, according to the Department of Health.The CATCH program targets selected schools in poorer districts without health centers.Parents are sent a letter informing them of the availability of contraception. If they do not check a box telling the school not to distribute contraceptives to their child, the student may access the drugs without permission."We wait about a month to give parents a chance to read the letter and opt out," said Caraway. "After that, any student at one of these schools can get emergency contraception or a pregnancy test if they feel they may be pregnant or have had unprotected sex."Students have long had access to condoms in the city schools.Last year, Department of Health doctors prescribed Plan B to 567 students. Another 580 students received hormonal birth control pills. This fall, teens will also have access to Depo-Provera, an injectable form of birth control.Scyatta A. Wallace, a New York City psychologist and founder and CEO of Janisaw Company, which specializes in life skills programs for young women, said she has "mixed feelings" about providing Plan B without explicit parental consent.She acknowledges that providing contraception does not "encourage" more sexual activity and that most parents "try hard" to educate their teens about sexual health and values. But other parents do a poor job talking to their teens."I do think we need to use caution in providing the Plan B pill to teens who may not fully understand why and how to use it," said Wallace.She said schools should have a protocol for how the contraceptive drugs will be distributed and need to provide follow-up to make sure the teen is "physically OK and to help them make more responsible decision in the future.""There really isn't enough comprehensive sexual health education provided in the schools in general, so it is alarming that they would offer Plan B in the absence of that," said Wallace.According to the Board of Health, 7,000 girls under age 17 got pregnant last year throughout New York City and 90 percent were unplanned. Of those, 64 percent were aborted. About 2,200 teens became mothers by age 17.	4	4	4	3	4	3	2	4	3	1	3	2	1	1	3	4

654	york-judge-likely-oversee-facebook-lawsuits-173553704--sector	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook Inc and most of its adversaries in a raft of lawsuits over its $16 billion initial public offering can agree on at least one thing: that the cases should be heard in a New York court.At a hearing on Thursday, lawyers for both sides asked a judicial panel to pool together dozens of lawsuits against the social networking company in Manhattan federal court. The panel made no immediate ruling, but did not question the idea of grouping the cases in New York.In at least 33 lawsuits seeking class-action status, Facebook investors have asked courts to hold the company and its underwriters responsible for causing them losses in the IPO in May. Investors say they lost money due to technical glitches on the Nasdaq stock market and accuse the company of selectively disclosing unflattering information about its business prospects to Wall Street analysts who then shared it with privileged investors.Facebook's IPO was one of the most hotly anticipated in recent memory, but the technical malfunctions embarrassed the company and the NASDAQ. The lawsuits, which seek unspecified damages, could cost Facebook millions of dollars to defend, as it strives to put the IPO problems behind it.While lawsuits have been also been filed in California, Florida and Washington, D.C., most plaintiffs and the defendants say the cases should proceed in New York because witnesses, evidence relating to the IPO, and the underwriter banks are all in that city."We're glad to be in New York and we'd like to stay here," Andrew Clubok, a lawyer for Facebook, told the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation at the hearing in Manhattan federal court.The only lawyer to speak against consolidation of the cases represented plaintiffs in two "derivative" lawsuits currently before a federal judge in San Francisco. Those suits seek to hold Facebook's board and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg responsible for damage they claim was done to the company.The derivatives plaintiffs say the litigation should take place in California state court, near Facebook's headquarters, for easy access to witnesses and documents.The 11-judge multidistrict panel, which meets periodically to decide where wide-ranging litigation should be consolidated, is expected to issue a decision within weeks. Seven judges were present for Thursday's hearing.Most of the cases are in New York already, and have been added to the docket of Manhattan federal judge Robert Sweet ever since he was randomly assigned the first complaint."There may be a good chance that Judge Sweet could get this case," panel Judge Paul Barbadoro of New Hampshire said, prompting laughs from the crowded courtroom.Facebook has said that it did not violate any rules and that Nasdaq was to blame for trading glitches on its first day of trading.NASDAQ OMX Group Inc is also facing investor lawsuits that claim it was negligent in failing to execute trades in the face of record-breaking volume during the IPO.William Slaughter, an attorney for NASDAQ, told the judges on Thursday that the exchange agreed those cases should also be before Judge Sweet, but that they should proceed on a separate track from the Facebook lawsuits."The two sets of actions ... really don't have much in common," he said.The case is In Re: Facebook Inc, IPO Securities and Derivative Litigation, U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, No. 12-md-2389.(Reporting By Basil Katz; Editing by Martha Graybow and Alden Bentley)	2	2	2	3	2	4	3	3	3	2	2	2	3	2	4

656	zimbabwe-city-residents-synchronize-toilet-flush-122626519	HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — City authorities in Zimbabwe's second largest city are appealing to home owners to flush their toilets at a specified time as a way to unblock sewers after days of severe water rationing.Bulawayo City Council has asked its more than 1 million residents to flush their toilets simultaneously at 7:30 p.m. Saturday when water supplies are restored. City officials say "synchronized flushing" is needed to clear waste that would have accumulated in sanitary facilities which will have been affected by days of water outages.Bulawayo's two main supply dams have been drying up due to drought conditions prevailing in the arid, southwestern part of Zimbabwe raising fears of worsening water shortages before the rainy season starts in November.	4	4	3	3	2	3	2	2	1	1	1	1	1	2	1	4
657	zjohnson-wins-gives-us-12-11-lead-ryder-211726685--spt	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) — Zach Johnson delivered only the second point of the day for the Americans at the Ryder Cup, beating Graeme McDowell 2 and 1.The United States now leads Europe 12-11, and needs 2 ½ points to regain the cup. The Americans have the lead in two of the remaining five matches.It was McDowell who delivered the winning point for Europe at Celtic Manor two years ago, but he was no match for Johnson on Sunday. The 2007 Masters champion led from the first hole, and McDowell conceded when Johnson put his 35-footer for birdie to two feet on the par-3 17. Johnson shook hands with McDowell and then turned to the crowd, urging them to cheer for one of the Americans' few bright spots of the day.	2	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	1	2	1	2	2	2	2	4
658	zooka-speaker-bar-makes-bluetooth-device-sound-better-155102180	Available in nine colorsClick here to view this gallery.[More from Mashable: Camera+ Arrives on the iPad]Carbon Audio's Zooka Bluetooth Speaker Bar is a versatile stand for your iPad that also wirelessly supplements that tablet's tinny speaker. It works with any Bluetooth compatible device -- including laptops -- and because of its flexible silicone construction, you can prop up lots of devices with it while it cranks out the sound. We gave it a listen.When I first held this Zooka speaker bar in my hands, I was impressed with the silicone material used for its construction. It has a silky feel to it, and it's flexible enough to fit all three models of the iPad, all of which I successfully fit into its flexible slot.[More from Mashable: Is ‘Bad Piggies’ More Fun Than ‘Angry Birds’?]I also tested the Zooka perched atop a MacBook Pro with Retina display, and it fit perfectly on the display without getting in the way of the screen. It also works on a MacBook Air, and any other modern laptop with Bluetooth compatibility and a thin screen. With all the Bluetooth devices with which I tested it, the Zooka paired up easily and sounded a lot better than any onboard speakers.There's a kickstand that stows away inside, and it's easy to remove it and screw it into the back of the device, turning it into an ideal stand for iPads or other similarly dimensioned tablets, smartphones or music players. I even tried it with an iPhone 5, which works particularly well in portrait mode because of the little cutout for the iPhone's Home button, and can function in landscape mode if you carefully place it within the silicone slot.There's even a decent microphone that works well as a speakerphone, and it's great for FaceTime or Skype conversations. And if you don't have Bluetooth, there's an auxiliary jack on the bottom that can accommodate any device which outputs audio via a 3.5 mm jack. And the company says the Zooka's "extended battery life" will let you rock your tunes for eight hours before you need to recharge, which in my testing seemed like a conservative estimate.How does it sound? I tried the Zooka for listening to all types of music, and while its high frequencies and mid-range sound is excellent and surprisingly powerful, the small, side-firing speakers had trouble with bass. Its sound is nowhere near as good as most of the bulky Bluetooth docks I've tested, but it's certainly a whole lot better than the iPad's and iPhone's internal speakers.I especially like using the Zooka to watch Netflix video on an iPad. I noticed the sound was perfectly usable, unless I was watching a movie that had lots of explosions -- making its weak bass response more noticeable. But there's a trade-off here -- the upside is that it's so portable, you can take it along with you for acceptable sound wherever you go.Formerly a Kickstarter project, this beautifully designed speaker bar is now available in the Apple Store for $99.95. Given its high-quality construction, good sound, quality materials and user-friendly design, I think it's a good value, especially if you can find it somewhere on sale.[From Carbon Audio]This story originally published on Mashable here.	3	4	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	1	4	4
