The chances for impact seem ripe this year. The two most unpopular major-party candidates in the history of ABC News/Washington Post polls are facing off. Donald Trump's unorthodox campaign style and provocative positions have piqued public interest; the debates may be the single best opportunity for him to allay concerns about his qualifications  temperament and policy promises alike. Hillary Clinton  for her part  needs -_ like Trump -_ to ease questions about her trustworthiness  as well as to spark greater enthusiasm among her supporters. Can either candidate move the needle? It will be tough: A review of data since 1960 suggests that past debates have almost never directly and measurably changed the candidates' relative standings. That's admittedly a high standard  though  and at least some debates may have had more subtle impacts. Debates have been held in 11 presidential races since 1960. We find just one after which the lead in presidential preference changed hands by a significant margin: In 1980  when Ronald Reagan uttered his ""are you better off?"" line. He gained 7 points in a post-debate poll. Still  there are other cases in which debates (or post-debate evaluations) may have influenced campaign dynamics. Debates are  after all  an essential window on the candidatesÍ styles and grasp of the issues. They can seem to add or reverse momentum. And polls are only so precise. Consider 1960: After Richard NixonÍs pasty-faced performance  John F. Kennedy went from 46 percent support to 49 percent in Gallup data; Nixon  from 47 percent to 46 percent. Those changes were within the polls' margin of sampling error. Nonetheless  the numerical ""lead"" switched  and collective memory maintains that the debates spelled Nixon's narrow defeat. Nor did Gallup polls show significant movement immediately after the 1976 debate in which Gerald Ford said Poland was free (and news reports pounced on the misstatement); Jimmy Carter gained a single point  Ford lost 3. Still  even if not measurably  the gaffe may have halted what had been a slide in Carter's lead. Then 73-year-old Reagan's teasing jibe in 1984 about 56-year-old Walter Mondale's ""youth and inexperience"" didn't meaningfully change the numbers in ABC News/Washington Post polls  but perhaps helped put aside questions about Reagan's age and acuity. In 2000  Al Gore's wonk-heavy performance saw him go in at +2 and leave at -3  but again  that was within sampling error. There's also the question of missed opportunities  as in Mike Dukakis' bloodless answer  in 1988  to what he'd do if his wife were raped and murdered. He didn't seize on the chance to show a non-technocratic side. And ABC/Post polls did not meaningfully move. ABC News/Washington Post polls in 1996  2004  2008 and 2012 also showed no significant movement around the debates. In 1992 there was more movement  including a significant gain for Ross Perot  but never enough to change Bill ClintonÍs advantage. In instant reactions  at least  polling has found that debates typically reinforce preconceived notions rather than change them. Most of each candidates' supporters say it's their candidate who won  and precious few say their minds were changed. But post-debate evaluations can shift. In 1992  right after the first debate  24 percent of viewers said Perot had won. By the next night  amid positive reviews of Perot's performance  that grew to 37 percent among people who'd watched  heard or read about it. And Perot's support did advance  from 6 percent before the debates to 17 percent after them. That shift may have been real  but it also may have reflected the challenges of immediate post-debate reaction polls. Conducted in mere minutes  among individuals pre-recruited to participate  they're subject to considerable sampling and weighting limitations. Further  some ask who ""won "" others who ""did the better job""; some accept ""tie"" as an answer and some don't. Instant reactions also bypass the role of considered judgment. Hard as it may be to believe in the Twitter Age  sometimes people actually need a little while to think about things. The clearest response to the debates this year may take some days to emerge. Rundown Here's a rundown of the measurable debate effect (or lack thereof) in each election since 1960. There were no debates in 1964  1968 or 1972. Click here for data tables associated with each election. 1960: Gallup had Nixon +1  but that was 12 days before the first debate; it had Kennedy +3 after it. Twelve days is a long time and 4 points is a small number. Gallup didn't poll between the remaining three debates  but showed Kennedy +4 after the last one. 1976: News reports jumped on Ford's misstatement of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe in the second debate. Carter's lead had been diminishing  and that did stop after this debate. But the measured change after the second debate was tiny -- Carter gained 1 point  Ford lost 3. 1980: This one looks to have mattered: Gallup's pre-debate poll had Carter +8; post-debate  Reagan +3. (John Anderson did not participate.) 1984: Mondale crept up  but Reagan stayed ahead by double digits nonetheless. 1988: We don't have an ABC poll done right before the first debate; in a Gallup poll it was George H. W. Bush +8. Our poll after the second debate showed no meaningful movement. 1992: Perot moved up 5 points in ABC News polling after the first debate and 4 points after the third debate. Before the debates he had 6 percent support; after the last debate he was up to 17 percent. Clinton moved up by 5 points after the second debate  Bush down by 6  then Clinton down by 6 after the third. But Clinton led throughout. 1996: The race looked perhaps slightly tighter after the second debate  but Clinton maintained a double-digit lead throughout. 2000: Gore went in +2 and came out -3 -_ a change of lead  but within sampling error. And a week after the last debate it was back to a dead heat  47-47 percent. 2004: There were some wiggles in the debate period _- a 6-point lead for George W. Bush before the first debate was a dead heat before the third -_ but when all was said and done the race after the debates looked a lot like the race before them. 2008: The main shift in vote preference came before the first debate  as Obama seized the reins of economic discontent after the failure of Lehman Brothers in mid-September. McCain's +2 in early September  just after the GOP convention  proved to be his best. The race shifted to Obama +9 in an ABC/Post poll completed Sept. 22  four days before the first debate. Obama never trailed again. 2012: Obama was +2 ahead of the first debate in ABC/Post polls  within the margin of sampling error  +3 after the second debate and -1 after the final debate  all within sampling error."	9/19/16	link	mostly true		1	33	341.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1035305953234297	"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge. The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.

Bombing Suspect Rahami Was Found Sleeping in the Hallway of a Bar WATCH: Police Officer Reveals How Bombing Suspect Was Taken Into Custody A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.  Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.  One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.  Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.

The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.  ""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.""  Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.  Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted.  Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.  Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.  A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami."	9/19/16	link	mostly true		34	63	271.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1035322636565962	"One day after explosive devices were discovered in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea and in Seaside Park and Elizabeth in New Jersey, Republican nominee Donald Trump repeated his calls to implement police profiling to stop more attacks in the United States.

On CBS NewsÕ Face the Nation on Sunday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway pushed the claim that so-called ""birtherism"" began with the Clinton 2008 campaign by invoking the words of former Clinton campaign manager Patti Sollis Doyle.  ÒEven Patti Solis Doyle, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in 2008 ... until she was fired by Hillary Clinton, admitted on Friday ... that she said, yes, these are her words: There was a volunteer in Iowa who was pushing this,Ó Conway said.  Sollis Doyle, in an interview on CNN, said a volunteer coordinator had forwarded an email promoting the birther conspiracy. But she said that person was immediately fired and that the birther conspiracy theory was never promoted by Clinton herself.  Fact-Checking Trump's Claim Clinton Started 'Birther' Movement 67 Times Donald Trump Tweeted About the 'Birther' Movement Conway also mentioned a memo circulated by Mark Penn when he was chief strategist for ClintonÕs 2008 campaign that talked about ObamaÕs lack of American roots.  Penn wrote a memo in 2007 saying that ObamaÕs foreign background could present a weakness for him and that Clinton should emphasize her middle-class Midwestern upbringing.  ""His roots to American values and culture are at best limited,"" the memo says. ""I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and values.""  But it does not say that Obama was foreign-born.  New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a prominent Trump supporter, also invoked Sollis DoyleÕs comments and then downplayed Trump's role in promoting the idea that Obama wasn't born in the U.S.  ""It's not true that he kept it up for five years,Ó Christie said on CNNÕs ÒState of the Union.Ó ÒIt wasn't like he was talking about it on a regular basis.""  Similarly, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus in an interview on ""Face the Nation"" said he thinks the ""birther"" movement ""was something that got started in the 2008 presidential campaign ... By the preponderance of evidence before us, Hillary Clinton, or her campaign, were definitely involved in this issue.""  Trump himself gave a short statement on Friday morning, at an event under the glittering chandeliers of his newest hotel, in an attempt to reverse his long-held assertion that there is uncertainty surrounding the location of President Obama's birth.  ÒHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,Ó the Republican presidential nominee said.  Trump's statement Friday came just a day after he refused to acknowledge to the Washington Post that Obama was born in the U.S. And for years, Trump had helped perpetuate conspiracy theories about whether the first black president is wholly American and in fact born in Hawaii -- as his public birth certificate says, an attack many, including Clinton, have said is racially charged.  In an August 2013 interview with ABC News' Jon Karl, for example, Trump stood behind his push to reveal Obama's ""true birth status.""  Karl asked, ""You don't acknowledge that you went overboard on this whole birther stuff?""  Trump replied, ""Actually, I think it made me very popular, if you want to know the truth, OK? So I do think I know what I'm doing."""	9/19/16	link	mostly true		7	62	641.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1035489746549251	"On Sunday, warplanes targeted the besieged Syrian city for the first time since the cease-fire went into effect last week, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured.  John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters.  ""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant.  Three of the latest national polls Ñ all conducted before the attacks this weekend Ñ had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.  Hillary Clinton: Terrorism Threat Is 'Real,' Calls for Resolve Donald Trump Repeats Calls for Police Profiling After NYC Area Explosions In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism.  A CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump's 45 percent.  The split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent.  ""Traditionally, it's been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said.

But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.  He said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf.""  James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump.  ""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said.  ""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added."	9/19/16	link	mostly true		13	101	731.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1035778606520365	"Ivanka Trump met privately with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, Monday in New York City, sources confirmed to ABC News.

The Democratic presidential nominee today held a millennial-focused campaign event at Temple University in Philadelphia, where she made her pitch to the voting bloc that has been unwilling to fully rally behind her.  ""Even if you are totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that,"" Clinton, in a moment of self-reflection, told the crowd of 300 people. ""And I want to do my best to answer those questions.Ó  She explained that the ÒserviceÓ part of Òpublic serviceÓ has always been easier for her than the ÒpublicÓ part. ÒI will never be the showman my opponent is and, you know what, that's OK with me,Ó she said, referring to Donald Trump.  Hillary Clinton: Terrorism Threat Is 'Real' and Calls for Resolve Donald Trump Repeats Calls for Police Profiling After NYC Area Explosions Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton Running Neck and Neck in New Poll 2 Months Before Election Day Over the past week, the Clinton campaign has redoubled its efforts to attract millennials, whom demographers define loosely as people born in the early-1980s through the early-2000s.  Clinton surrogates President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have all been tapped to hit the trail.  The main focus: urging young people to vote.  ÒWe need everyone off the sidelines,Ó Clinton said today. ÒNot voting is not an option. That just plays into TrumpÕs hands, it really does.Ó  Clinton, who started her remarks calling on the country to Òremain vigilantÓ in the wake of the bombings in New York and New Jersey, also used the opportunity to contrast herself with her Republican opponent.  ""You want something to vote for, not just against,"" she told the crowd. ÒOptimism, not resentment. Answers, not anger. Ideas, not insults. Bridges, not walls.  ÒYou're also here because you know this election isn't a reality-TV show. It shouldn't be about birth certificates or name calling or stunts to get on the cable news,Ó she added, referencing TrumpÕs long-held and false belief that Obama was born outside the United States.  ÒThis election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America,Ó she concluded.  Trump has since said that he believes Obama was born in the United States.  Although Clinton is polling better with young adults than Trump (a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that she has 40 percent support among youth versus TrumpÕs 28 percent), the demographic, as a whole, has shown less enthusiasm for her candidacy than other Democrats.  According to that same poll, 60 percent of Democratic adults under the age of 30 said they had hoped Sanders would win their partyÕs nomination, while 26 percent said Clinton.  That number, however, is better than it was four months ago. (During the primary in spring, 75 percent of Democrats under the age of 30 supported Sanders, while only 25 percent said they supported Clinton, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll.)  Clinton campaign officials, who hope to close that gap further, say they plan to continue these outreach efforts throughout the rest of the campaign.  ""The millennial generation is a key voting bloc in this election and it's clear that the campaign must do more to earn their vote,Ó Clinton spokesman Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement today. ÒThat is why the campaign has recently ramped up efforts to engage millennial voters through a stretch of events with surrogates like President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Senator Tim Kaine, Anne Holton, Chelsea Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders.  ÒThe campaign has also brought on board staff at headquarters and in states to organize and mobilize millennial voters,Ó she added. ÒAnd over the coming weeks, the campaign will continue to host discussions in communities on how Hillary Clinton is fighting for them.Ó  ABC NewsÕ Ryan Struyk contributed to this report."	9/19/16	link	mostly true		25	263	871.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1035825603182332	"Today marks the one-week mark ahead of the first of the three presidential debates during the 2016 campaign and the candidates are gearing up.

Trump started his debate prep in late August, and at the time, sources told ABC News that he hadn't participated in mock debates, which is one of the more typical prep strategies for presidential candidates.

With 93% of the vote counted, the party, United Russia, was shown to have taken 343 of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament, a sizable increase on its previous 238 seats.  The vote was marked by an exceptionally low turnout of just 40 percent, illustrating a sense among many Russians that the election was of little importance in a country where the Kremlin determines all major policy decisions and elections are seen as stage-managed.  PHOTO: People stand inside voting booths as they visit a polling station during a parliamentary election in Stavropol, Russia, Sept. 18, 2016. Eduard Korniyenko/Reuters People stand inside voting booths as they visit a polling station during a parliamentary election in Stavropol, Russia, Sept. 18, 2016. more + Still, the result reinforced the political system engineered by the Kremlin under Putin over the past 16 years. The two parties that took second and third place are nominally in opposition to the Russian leader but in practice almost invariably support the Kremlin line. Reflecting the strength of nationalist feeling in Russia following the seizure of Crimea, the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party came second to United Russia with around 15 percent of the vote, a strong showing for the party that is led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a man regularly described as RussiaÕs Donald Trump. RussiaÕs Communist Party came a close third, while the anti-Putin opposition failed to break the 5% barrier to enter parliament, losing its only lawmaker there. The win gives United Russia a two-thirds majority that allows it to amend the constitution.  United Russia's head, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev declared victory and Putin congratulated the party, saying it showed ""political maturity"" among Russians.  The outcome was not surprising. With the country strongly behind Putin -- whose approval ratings stand around 80 percent -- and the opposition effectively sidelined, the vote had been described by some observers as the ÒdullestÓ election in Russian history. The only surprise was the scale of United Russia's win, overcoming polls suggesting it would have a poor showing.  That was in stark contrast to the last time Russians voted for their parliament in 2011, when significant vote-rigging prompted huge street protests. Tens of thousands marched in Moscow demanding PutinÕs resignation in what was the biggest popular challenge to his rule that the Russian leader has faced.  Such upheavals seem now all but impossible, underlining the vivid shift in RussiaÕs political atmosphere since then.  Eager to avoid a repeat of 2011Õs trouble, this time the Kremlin has sought to create an impression that the vote would be clean. It removed the head of RussiaÕs elections commission -- pejoratively nicknamed the ÒwizardÓ for his ability to make the numbers add up in PutinÕs favor, and replacing him with a respected human rights defender. Confident the countryÕs beleaguered opposition was without traction among the public, authorities had also opened up a small breathing space for them during the elections allowing them to field more candidates and to take part in TV debates.  Those moves led many to predict the elections would not see significant amounts of voting fraud. With popular sentiment aggressively pro-Putin and most Russians convinced of the impossibility of political change, there appeared little need for vote rigging. How true that was was still being debated on Monday. Following the vote across Russia's 11 time zones, it was clear that the vote had been far from pristine, with growing reports of cheating and numerous videos appearing to show ballot-stuffing, but there were few claims that the violations had had any decisive impact. While threatening to annul some results where cheating was recorded, the head of RussiaÕs elections commission, Ella Pamfilova, said was sure the vote had been legitimate, the TASS state news agency reported.  Although the vote may prove to be cleaner than in the past, critics said it was not fairer. Under Putin, the Kremlin has neutered RussiaÕs political debates, creating a pseudo-opposition and marginalizing actual opponents by jailing or blocking them from running, largely barring them from television, and harassing their campaigns.  The parliament itself has become a rubber-stamping body, directed on how to act on most issues by the Kremlin and offering no opposition on major decisions. Before today the unauthorized opposition, the so-called Ònonsystem oppositionÓ, had only one lawmaker in the parliament, and its leaders and activists have been continuously harassed and occasionally physically attacked.  This year, as part of the experiment to lend greater legitimacy to the elections, anti-Putin parties were given greater leeway. That step, however, seemed to reflect the KremlinÕs confidence in its position rather than any newfound political liberalism. With the country wrapped in nationalist sentiment following CrimeaÕs annexation and intensified repression of dissent, there is virtually no desire for major political change. Yabloko and Parnas, the two leading parties running on anti-Putin platforms, both failed to get above the 5%, with the early results suggesting that Russia's parliament would now not have a single openly anti-Putin lawmaker in parliament.  With the final result never in doubt, there was a sensation of the system going through the motions and the majority of Russians appeared to opt out of the vote, viewing it as of little relevance.  Many Russians said they canÕt remember a more lackluster election run. Even the Kremlin official tasked with managing the vote, Vladimir Volodin, has described United RussiaÕs campaign as ÒsterileÓ, telling the business paper RBC that he believed the tactic was not to produce enthusiasm for the party but just to bring off a technically irreproachable campaign.  The apathy was reflected in a record low turnout, at 40.37% the lowest since Putin took power in 2000 and 20% lower than in the contested election in 2012. In Moscow, the turnout was just 33%. In the days prior to voting, a startling number of Russians were not even aware the elections were happening.  The sharp drop in participation compared with 2011, suggested that Russians' beliefs in what was politically possible in the country had narrowed considerably.  At polling stations in Moscow on Sunday, many voters said they expected the vote to be cleaner than in previous years, though few expected it would be totally without fraud. Many, even those voting for the ruling party, were ambivalent about whether the vote showed Russia had democracy. Asked whether he felt Russia was democratic, one man pulled face and made a half-and-half gesture with his hand.  ÒDoes Russia have democracy?,Ó Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich, 63, said before voting. ÒMaybe. Probably we have some kind of democracy. I donÕt know, I havenÕt seen any other kind.Ó  Others were more definite, saying that although they did not believe they had full-fledged democracy, it was important to vote to keep what elements of it still exist in Russia.  ÒAt the very least, it opposes the trend of authoritarianism that has appeared in Russia recently,Ó Lev Karakhan, a television producer accompanied by his children said after voting."	9/19/16	link	mostly true		3	24	61.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1036151719816387	"Former President George H.W.

Some new information about the final debate was announced today, and considering the first two presidential debates of this cycle were the most viewed ever in the history of presidential debates, the third and final one could make history as well.  ""I think there's going to be a lot of focus [on the debates] and they've always been a really important part of the process,"" said Peter Eyre, a senior adviser with the Commission on Presidential Debates, the independent organization that sponsors the events.  Watch the third presidential debate on ABC News and ABCNews.com at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Oct. 19.  Here's a rundown of the debates so far and what we know about the second and third head-to-head match-ups between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.  When and Where  First presidential debate: Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.  Moderator: NBC's ""Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt  The debate had six segments covering different subjects, as mandated by the commission.  The commission had announced that Holt selected three topics -- America's direction, achieving prosperity and securing America -- to cover during the debate, but noted that they were subject to change based on news events.  Vice presidential debate: Oct. 4 at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.  Moderator: CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano  The debate was set to feature nine segments, each about 10 minutes long. The topics of the debate were not announced in advance.  Tim Kaine answered the first question, as a result of a coin toss.  Second presidential debate: Oct. 9 at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.  Moderators: ABC News' chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz and CNN anchor Anderson Cooper  The debate was held in a town hall format, with about half the questions asked by members of the audience and the other by the moderators. Gallup was responsible for finding the audience members, who are supposed to be uncommitted voters, the commission announced.  The topics of the debate were not announced in advance.  Third presidential debate: Oct. 19 at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.  Moderator: ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace  The final debate will be in the same format as the first one.  The specific topics of the debate were announced today and include debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the Supreme Court, foreign hot spots and fitness to be president. They are subject to change based on news events.

Based on the CPD's average of polls from five different national polls, Clinton has 44.8 percent of the national vote, Trump has 40.8 percent, and neither Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson nor Green Party candidate Jill Stein passed the required 15 percent threshold to be included in the debate. The averages put Johnson at 7.8 percent and Green at 2.6 percent, respectively.  The commission previously announced it will use five surveys -- ABC News/Washington Post, CBS/New York Times, CNN/Opinion Research Corp., Fox News and NBC/Wall Street Journal -- to make the decision.  Kaine and Pence were the only two candidates who participated in the vice presidential debate.  Who Will Be in the Audience  The names of any high-profile campaign guests have not yet been announced for the town hall debate.  For that town hall debate, the participating audience will be anywhere in size from a couple dozen people up to as many as 100 people, with a viewing audience of about 1,000.  Polling company Gallup has been tasked with finding the audience members for the participating audience, who are expected to be uncommitted voters.  In the run-up to the first presidential debate, attention was paid to some of the big names who would be in the audience off-stage.  Chelsea Clinton attended the debate, a first for her this election cycle after not attending any of the Democratic primary debates. And then another familiar face was present in the front row supporting Team Clinton: Mark Cuban.  The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is a vocal Clinton supporter and reportedly went so far as to volunteer to play Trump in Clinton's mock debates. He has said the Clinton team never returned his email offer, but they did keep him in mind for another move.  Just got a front row seat to watch @HillaryClinton overwhelm @realDonaldTrump at the ""Humbling at Hofstra"" on Monday. It Is On !  Ñ Mark Cuban (@mcuban) September 23, 2016 About 1,000 people are expected in the viewing audience at each debate, and while Eyre didnÕt expect there to be frequent cuts to the audience by TV cameras, there is a chance that special guests sitting near the front may be seen on TV at some point.  The audience will be a mix of guests of the universities, guests of the campaigns and ""others who have made the debates possible, including sponsors, members of the media, security, etc.,"" he said.  How the Moderators Were Picked  Commission officials are tasked with picking the moderators for the debates, and while they normally announce their decisions in August, the final list was released in September this year.  ""These journalists bring extensive experience to the job of moderating, and understand the importance of using expanded time periods effectively,Ó Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. and Michael D. McCurry, co-chairs of the nonpartisan commission, said in the statement announcing the moderators.  Raddatz, who is a co-anchor of the ABC News Sunday show ""This Week,"" is the only one of the four who has been selected by the commission before. She moderated the vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan in 2012.  CNN's Candy Crowley was selected to moderate the town hall-style debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012. This year, that format will have two moderators: Raddatz and Cooper.  Crowley was the second female debate moderator ever. The first was ABC News' Carole Simpson in 1992.  ""The formats chosen for this year's debates are designed to build on the formats introduced in 2012, which focused big blocks of time on major domestic and foreign topics,Ó Fahrenkopf and McCurry said in the statement. ÒWe are grateful for their willingness to moderate, and confident that the public will learn more about the candidates and the issues as a result.Ó  Debate Prep Underway  Trump spoke repeatedly about his relaxed approach to preparations ahead of the first presidential debate. That might have changed with the second debate, but not according to Trump: he denies that a town hall-style event in New Hampshire on Thursday -- complete with a timer set to the same response times required for Sunday's debate -- was practice for the main event this weekend.  Kaine and Pence have both been running mock debates, with D.C. power lawyer Bob Barnett acting as Pence and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker standing in as Kaine.  As for the top of their tickets, the candidates took dramatically different approaches to debate prep in keeping with their starkly different campaigns.  Clinton cleared her schedule and took herself off the campaign trail for the four days before the first debate. She did intensive debate prep, which included mock debates complete with a Trump stand-in: her longtime aide Philippe Reines, whom Clinton has called ""loyal, passionate and shrewd.""  She also reviewed Trump's performance in Republican primary debates, according to campaign sources.  By contrast, Trump had two campaign events scheduled days before the first debate on Sept. 26.  His debate prep was slim and he did not delve into policy or participated in mock debates, sources have told ABC News.  The one study tactic that they both shared was a review of their opponent's past performances. But while aides say Clinton actively reviewed Trump's work, senior level Trump sources said he was given an iPad loaded with footage of old Clinton debates, though it's unclear how much time he spent watching them.  Trump was reportedly being advised by his senior campaign staff, including campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and campaign CEO Stephen Bannon, as well as former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, who has worked on the campaigns of Presidents George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan in the past.  Well-known Washington lawyer Bob Barnett was said to be advising Clinton during her debate prep. He helped her prepare for the primary debates by playing Sen. Bernie Sanders. The campaign reportedly found someone to play Trump in their mock debates but they were tight-lipped about the person's identity.  Trump didnÕt speak extensively about his debate prep, but talked about the tone he expected to take.  ""I'm going to be very respectful of her,"" Trump said during a phone interview on Fox News before the first debate, referring to Clinton.  ""I think she deserves that and I'm going to be nice. And if she's respectful of me, thatÕll be nice. We'll have something that I think people will respect as a debate but we'll see where it all goes. You really never know exactly how it's going to turn out and that's why weÕre going to have a lot of people watching,"" Trump said.

""Today a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,"" Obama warned, without naming the Republican presidential nominee.  Obama further cautioning against ""the same forces of global integration"" that have made democracies interdependent while exposing ""deep fault lines in the existing international order"" like gaps between the rich and poor created by capitalism throughout the world.  He made two other references to the ineffectiveness of walls in stopping global forces, quipping in an apparent reference to the Zika virus that ""mosquitoes don't respect walls"" and saying of terrorism that ""the world is simply too small to be able to build a wall and stop it from affecting our own societies.""  Though he never directly addressed the U.S. presidential election, Obama's message for the General Assembly was in many ways applicable to the impulses raging in the race, citing ""a contest between authoritarianism and democracy right now"" and an appeal for a top-down ""strongman model.""  Obama rejected such tendencies. ""History shows that strongmen are then left with two paths,"" he said. ""Permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.""  This Is Home: Children Document Life in World's Largest Syrian Refugee Camp President Obama Seeks to Reassure Americans After Bombings Speaking about the big picture, the Obama recounted the progress made during his presidency, on issues such as the global financial crisis, international terrorism and re-establishing relations with Cuba.  ""This is important work,"" he stressed. ""It has made a real difference in the lives of our people, and it could not have happened had we not worked together.""  Obama said nations ""can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration"" or ""retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion.""  ""I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not backward,"" he said, although he added that doing so would require nations of the world to ""acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.""  ""The answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration,"" Obama said. ""Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared and that the disruptions Ñ economic, political and cultural Ñ that are caused by integration are squarely addressed."" Obama demanded that democracies of the world ""speak out forcefully"" for ""freedom and dignity.""  ""A world in which 1 percent of the economy controls the other 99 percent will never be stable,"" he said. ""These are the policies I've pursued in the United States, and with clear results"" Ñ touting progress in job creation, cutting poverty, improving infrastructure and investing in childhood education.  His speech came as fighting in Syria has resumed after the Syrian military declared Monday an end to the fragile cease-fire deal that was brokered between the U.S. and Russia just over a week ago.  ""Together now we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home. We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering,"" Obama said. ""There's a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing, but many nations Ñ particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography Ñ that can do more to offer a hand.""  In the same month that North Korea conducted its second nuclear test of the year, Obama highlighted the benefits of free markets over markets resisting influence from globalization.  ""We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box, nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market distorting subsidies, overreliance on national resources instead of innovation, these approaches will make us poor collectively, and they're more likely to lead to conflict,"" he said.  ""And the stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central plan to control the economy is a dead end,"" Obama said."	9/20/16	link	mostly true		15	209	471.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1036447253120167	"Aid to Syria has been suspended after yesterday's attack on a United Nations and Syrian Arab Red Crescent convoy in the countryside of Aleppo.

Of the 31 trucks in the convoy, at least 18 were hit. A Syrian Red Crescent warehouse was also destroyed and a health clinic severely damaged, the U.N. said. About 20 civilians and one SARC staff member were killed as they were unloading the trucks, according to a joint statement from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  ""The convoys that we had hoped to move across the border to Syria as well as aid inside Syria have been temporarily put on hold.

""For more than a week, we have urged Moscow to fulfill the commitments it made in Geneva to facilitate the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people.

The writings were apparently on Rahami when he allegedly engaged in a firefight with police, and the pages were shot through with a bullet. The officials said that in them, Rahami refers to the late American al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, whose sermons and writings have been linked to a number of terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S.  Ghost of American al-Qaeda Haunts Another US Terror Plot FBI Opened Previous Inquiry Into Bombing Suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami A federal complaint filed against Rahami late Tuesday said that in the journal, he also praised Nidal Hasan, the 2009 Fort Hood shooter, and al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden.  ""You (USA Government) continue your [unintelligible] slaught[er] against the mujahidean [Islamic warriors] be it Afghanistan, Iraq, Sham [Syria], Palestine..."" part of the journal reads, according to the complaint. ""[God willing] the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death to your OPPRESSION.""  Investigators have also seized ""a lot of papers"" at a home linked to Rahami, a source told ABC News.  As of late Monday, authorities had not determined a motive for Rahami, who has been linked to bombings over the weekend in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea and in New Jersey. Though two of the explosives were housed in pressure cookers, as was the case in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, the officials said there was no mention in Rahami's purported writings of the perpetrators of that attack, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Today officials said they're also investigating a possible link to five unexploded pipe bombs recovered in Elizabeth, N.J.  Rahami has been charged with attempted murder related to the shootout with police just before he was apprehended Monday.

Two years ago, Rahami's father told the FBI that his son was interacting with ""bad people"" overseas and a concerned citizen in the neighborhood told authorities that Rahami's associates may have been trying to procure explosives, sources told ABC News.  The FBI first became aware of Rahami in the summer of 2014, when local law enforcement contacted the agency's New Jersey field office about him, sources said.  A dispute at the Rahami home had brought local law enforcement to the house at that time. A neighbor told the authorities he overheard Rahami's father calling his son a ""terrorist,"" according to a U.S. official. In addition, the neighbor said RahamiÕs father had expressed concern his son may be in contact with people overseas who were collecting explosives, ABC news was told.  The FBI then opened a so-called ""Guardian"" file on Rahami, initiating a process to determine whether Rahami had any links to terrorism or other criminal activity and whether a more formal investigation was warranted.  The assessment of Rahami produced no clear evidence or indications of radicalization, and at one point his father recanted his claims, sources said. Rahami was not placed on any U.S. terrorism watch lists.  Speaking to reporters today outside of his New Jersey home, Rahami's father said he ""called the FBI two years ago"" about his son.  ""I told them you got a connection with this guy,"" he said, without offering any further information.  Suspect in New York, New Jersey Bombings Caught After Shootout The FBI interviewed RahamiÕs father after New Jersey officials compiled complaints and sent them a suspicious activity report. He told the FBI that his son had traveled to Pakistan and was interacting with ""bad people,"" according to sources. Rahami's father also told the FBI his son had injured and beaten members of his immediate family -- but a grand jury declined to file charges against him.  However, Rahami's father later told the FBI he didn't mean to suggest his son was a terrorist, but that he was hanging out with ""undesirables,"" the U.S. official said.  At a press conference Monday, the head of the FBI's field office in New York, Bill Sweeney, noted that the FBI had previously received ""a report of a domestic incident,"" adding that ""the allegations [were] recanted."" However, Sweeney did not address terrorism-related allegations.  ItÕs unclear if the FBI or other law enforcement agencies interviewed Rahami in 2014.  As in most suspicious activity report cases they review, the FBI found no significant derogatory information in Rahami's case, sources told ABC News.  In a statement today, the FBI acknowledged that in August 2014 they ""initiated an assessment of Ahmad Rahami based upon comments made by his father after a domestic dispute that were subsequently reported to authorities.""  ""The FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks, and multiple interviews -- none of which revealed ties to terrorism,"" the statement said.  One source emphasized that only a single report came to authorities related to Rahami. Had more reports come in, authorities would have looked further at him, the source said, adding that the FBI does not have the resources to put every subject of a suspicious activity report under full-time surveillance.  ""We should not be keeping people under surveillance indefinitely"" when there is no solid reason, another U.S. official said, adding that doing so would violate Constitutional rights.  ""Our job together is to find those needles in a hay stack,"" FBI Director James Comey recently told lawmakers. ""In fact, our job is harder than that, it's to find pieces of hay in that haystack that may become a needle and disrupt them before they move from consuming to acting on that [online] poisonous propaganda.""  The FBIÕs ability to assess potential terrorists came under intense scrutiny after Florida native Omar Mateen opened fire in OrlandoÕs Pulse nightclub in June, killing 49 people and injuring scores more.  In May 2013 the FBI had obtained sufficient information to open a preliminary investigation into Mateen Ñ coworkers told authorities that Mateen had made terrorism-related comments at work. But after ten months of investigation, including two interviews with Mateen, the FBI determined there wasnÕt enough information to indicate he was ""possibly a terrorist,"" as FBI Director James Comey put it after the Orlando attack.  Two months later, in July 2014, the FBI took another look at Mateen because his name ""surfaced"" in a separate terrorism investigation, Comey told reporters. Mateen was interviewed again, but authorities found no reason to continue tracking him."	9/20/16	link	mostly true		9	37	121.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1036582596439966	"Following the shooting death of an unarmed black man by a police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last Friday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton spoke out today against police violence.

ClintonÕs campaign is footing the bill for slightly more than half her scheduled television advertising, while TrumpÕs campaign is slated for about $4 in $10.

Richard Corkery/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images Real-estate mogul Donald Trump plays a round during an opening celebration for his latest venture, the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, New York. more + In a September 2007 letter to the town, as reported by the Post, Trump wrote, ÒI have sent a check for $100,000 to Fisher House.  Although the court documents show that under the settlement, Trump or Mar-a-Lago would make the payment, the payment apparently instead came from the Trump Foundation.  Tax forms for the Trump Foundation show that in 2007 the charity gave $100,000 to Fisher House, an organization that helps pay for housing for veteransÕ relatives when their loved ones are receiving medical treatment. It was one of only three $100,000 donations it made that year; the other two were to a New York hospital and a police athletic league.  Fisher House confirmed to ABC News that it received a $100,000 check from the foundation on Sept. 11, 2007. It does not have a copy of the check available.  Legal Questions  The IRS has strict rules on the operation of tax-exempt private foundations, including against what it calls self-dealing. To qualify for tax-exempt status, a foundation is required to demonstrate, among other things, that Òno part of its net earnings inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual,Ó according to an online IRS publication.  Mayer noted that if the lawsuit settlement was paid for by TrumpÕs foundation, he wouldnÕt be the first person to violate tax law in this way.  ÒItÕs not unheard of for people to use their private foundations for their own benefit. Usually if the IRS learns about it, the insider has to pay a penalty tax and repay foundation with interest,Ó Mayer said.  It can be a civil action or a criminal violation, but Mayer has Ònever heard of anyone serving prison time for this kind of thing.Ó  ÒHere the foundation allegedly paid for a substantial benefit to TrumpÕs business Ñ the dropping of lawsuits. That is clearly crossing the line. ItÕs not even close,Ó he said.  The Foundation Takes in Money Other Than TrumpÕs  The Trump Foundation takes in substantial donations from people and organizations, including until eight years ago Trump himself. In 2007, tax forms show that the charity had revenue of close to $4.1 million, from contributions, gifts and grants. Of that total, Trump donated $35,000.  Similarly, in 2008, Trump gave $30,000 to the foundation. In previous years, his contributions were bigger, ranging from $184,000 to $713,000. Trump made no donations to his foundation from 2009 to 2014, which is the last year for which records are available.  A few years after the Mar-a-Lago settlement, the foundation reportedly paid $158,000 to settle a lawsuit against one of TrumpÕs golf courses in New York, which led to a charitable donation by the foundation.  The foundation is under investigation by the New York Attorney GeneralÕs Office over a payment made to a political group associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Trump supporter who spoke at the Republican National Convention this summer.  A person familiar with the probe tells ABC News that the New York Attorney GeneralÕs Office is also investigating all the donations mentioned in the Post report.  The Clinton campaignÕs Reynolds said in her statement, ÒOnce again, Trump has proven himself a fraud who believes the rules donÕt apply to him. ItÕs past time for him to release his tax returns to show whether his tax issues extend to his own personal finances.Ó  ABC NewsÕ Liz Kreutz contributed to this report."	9/20/16	link	mostly true		35	243	811.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1037005106397715	"Several protesters and a dozen police officers were injured, and about five people were arrested after violent protests erupted after a deadly police shooting in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday.

""IÕm really really appalled by having my image, you know, on Twitter used against the refugees,"" said David Kittos, 48.  Trump Jr., the eldest son of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, posted a graphic on Twitter featuring an image of a bowl of Skittles, with a caption equating Syrian refugees to poisoned candy, which sparked outrage among many on social media.  ÒIf I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful?Ó the tweet's graphic says, ""That's our Syrian refugee problem.""  David Kittos, 48, who told ABC News he took the photo and who has what appears to be an identical image posted on Flickr from 2010, said, ""How someone could twist things, and I donÕt know, use my image to compare some sort of poor refugee to a poison sort of Skittle, that is just really beyond belief.""  Donald Trump Jr. Compares Syrian Refugees to Skittles Donald Trump Jr.'s Skittles Tweet Highlights His Key Campaign Role Kittos, who said he lives in the United Kingdom and left Cyprus as a refugee when he was 6, claims that he was not asked permission for use of his photo.  ""I havenÕt put the image for sale, and it was all rights reserved, so no, I wasnÕt really expecting anyone to want to take it,"" Kittos said. ""I have had stuff stolen before but when I got an email from some news website I was sort of really annoyed and disgusted to be honest.""  Kittos told ABC News he does photography as a hobby and took the Skittles photo while experimenting with different flash techniques in his living room six years ago, never expecting it to become part of a political campaign.  The plight of refugees is an issue close to Kittos, who recalls fleeing Cyprus as a child.  ""We all had to kind of just take our stuff and run away. It was quite frightening for all people who had to do it, especially for the people who actually lost family and not just their belongings,"" he said.  If he could talk to Donald Trump, Kittos said he would ask him to apologize to Syrian refugees. ""But I donÕt expect he will do that,"" he said.  The Trump campaign responded to a question about the photo with a more general comment on the controversy over the tweet.  ""America has become less safe under Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Clinton's planned 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put American lives at risk,"" the campaign's senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, said in a statement.  ""Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do what's needed to protect us,"" the statement said.

West said that he voted for Sanders in the primary and that, in his opinion, Stein was closer to Sanders than Clinton on the issues. As he passed out flyers, he rejected the key argument from Sanders that in a battleground state like Ohio, where polls have the two major candidates neck and neck, he should vote for Clinton to stave off a Trump win.  ÒIf the Democratic Party had chosen a candidate that everybody would support, then there wouldnÕt be an issue at all with Trump winning,Ó he said. Asked specifically if he worried about Trump winning, West went on: ÒThat has nothing to do with me.Ó  It remains to be seen whether Bernie Sanders, the choice candidate on many college campuses during the primary season, will be an effective surrogate for Hillary Clinton, who urgently needs the student and millennial vote. While stumping for Clinton at two universities in Ohio over the weekend, Sanders spent minimal time making a case for Clinton, but instead focused his remarks on why voters should reject her opponent.  Sanders spoke passionately against Donald Trump. He accused the Republican Party nominee of rejecting science and trying to delegitimize Barack ObamaÕs presidency.  ÒYou want to disagree with Obama? Disagree with Obama. But do not go around putting a lot of money into trying to tell the American people that because we have an African American who happens to be president today that he is not a legitimate president,Ó the senator said while speaking at Akron University. ÒThat is an awful and divisive and terrible thing to do.Ó  But when talking about his former primary opponent, the Vermont senator primarily compared Clinton to Trump or listed ways in which she agrees with his own signature policy proposals on college affordability and health care.  ÒHillary Clinton and I believe that the time is now to ask the wealthiest people and the largest corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes,Ó he said during his swing through the battleground state.  However, recent polling suggests that when it comes to winning the youth vote (a key demographic for President Obama) perhaps ClintonÕs greatest challenge is not Trump, but other third-party candidates.  In the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, only 40 percent of adults under 30 years old backed Clinton in the general election -- a stark contrast from the 60 percent that Obama won in 2012. This is largely because one in three adults under 30 say they plan to vote for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein -- or not vote at all.  But enthusiasm also matters: even months after the Democratic primary process wrapped up, 60 percent of Democratic adults under 30 say they wish that Bernie Sanders had won the nomination. In fact, only a quarter of them say they wanted Clinton to win the nod.  During a listening tour across the state of Ohio, ABC News found that college students were much quicker to bring up the third-party options.  Ohio State University Students on What Matters in the 2016 Election Battleground State Polls Show Tight Races Between Trump and Clinton Before hitting the campaign trail again, Sanders specifically urged his supporters not to back third-party candidates.  ÒNow is not the time to be supporting a protest vote,Ó he said during an interview on MSNBC. ÒRight now we have to make sure Trump does not become president and Clinton is the person to beat him.Ó  During a campaign stop at Temple University on Tuesday, Clinton appealed to students who may still have reservations about her.  ÒEven if you are totally opposed to Donald Trump you may still have some questions about me. I get that,Ó she said. ÒAnd I want to do my best to answer those questions.Ó  While speaking on campuses, both Clinton and Sanders emphasized getting to the polls. Sanders told students they should not just vote, but volunteer and get involved with politics.  ÒIf we have a large voter turnout, for Secretary Clinton and Ted Strickland [the Democratic nominee for Senate in Ohio] here in Ohio and the entire nation will be very gratified for what you do,"" Sanders said.

The move may be the best chance for the U.S. to help bring an end to the violence, humanitarian crisis and displacement of thousands of Syrians.  Kerry's determination to restore the cease-fire comes in wake of the most flagrant yet of the violations: Two days ago, a United Nations humanitarian aid convoy headed to opposition-held areas of Aleppo was destroyed in a prolonged airstrike.  A Syrian Refugee Family Begins Again in California US Blasts Russia for Calling Emergency UN Meeting Over Syria Bombing ""On Monday, 20 aid workers were killed in an outrageous, sustained, two-hour attack directed at a fully authorized humanitarian mission near Aleppo Ñ fully authorized,"" Kerry told the Security Council this morning. ""All of the permits had been given. Everybody was on notice.""  U.S. officials believe Russian aircraft, not Syrian, were responsible for the strike but have yet to publicly accuse Moscow. Yesterday the White House said it could have been only Russians or the Syrian regime and that either way, Russia is accountable for the strikes, given its leverage over Syria and its commitments under the cease-fire.  In spite of all this, rather than abandon the cease-fire, Kerry today urged the Syrian regime to adhere to its terms, calling for the grounding of all regime aircraft.  ""Our purpose in this negotiation was to put an end to the kind of horrific and indiscriminate attacks that have been the primary cause of fear, of suffering, of displacement,"" Kerry said. ""And under our plan, all of this could be quickly accompanied by serious negotiations between the parties, aimed at a political transition and a conclusion to the conflict.""  Meanwhile, the Russians have released a series of conflicting statements in an effort to justify the strike on the U.N. convoy. They suggested at one point the convoy was accompanied by an armed opposition vehicle and most recently suggested the strike might have been carried out by a U.S. drone flying in the region. The U.S. Defense Department quickly denied that, saying it doesn't fly aircraft over that area of Syria.  Moscow has yet to respond to Kerry's request to ground all regime aircraft, but negotiations will likely continue through the rest of the week at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.

If Clinton came looking for a fight, she found it. Her aggressive tone drew Trump in.  He attacked Clinton right back, showing flashes of anger that channeled public frustration and also the coarser side of his public persona.  It made for some lively exchanges, including several that brought an edge to TrumpÕs tone.  ÒShe doesnÕt have the look,Ó Trump said toward the end of the debate. ÒShe doesnÕt have the stamina.Ó  Trump appeared rattled at times, particularly as the debate wore on. Yet his main attacks on Clinton were rooted in policy grounds, as he sought to give voice to public anger not just at Clinton but at the broader political class.  ÒYouÕve been doing this for 30 years Ñ why are you just thinking about these solutions now?Ó Trump said in a section of the debate about ways to create jobs.  ÒI have thought about this quite a bit,Ó Clinton countered.  ÒYeah, for 30 years,Ó Trump responded.  Trump stretched facts and attacked ClintonÕs temperament. He Ñ for the most part Ñ kept his cool.  Debate Fact-Check: How Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Stack Up First Presidential Debate: 10 Moments That Mattered Most Memorable Lines of the First Presidential Debate Throughout the debate, Clinton called Trump ÒDonald.Ó He almost always referred to her as ÒSecretary ClintonÓ and made sure that was all right with her.  ÒI want you to be very happy. ItÕs very important to me,Ó Trump said, challenging the fact-checkers once again.  Trump was brought onto his shakiest ground of the night when moderator Lester Holt brought up President Barack ObamaÕs birthplace Ñ specifically why it took Trump until just weeks ago to declare the matter settled.  Trump flatly said, ÒI say nothingÓ to those who wonder why he pushed the matter as long as he did. And he falsely accused Clinton of starting the birther question in 2007, claiming credit for putting the issue to rest.  ÒJust like she canÕt bring back jobs, she canÕt produceÓ ObamaÕs birth certificate, Trump said.  Clinton pounced on an issue with resonance among black voters and other parts of the Obama coalition.  ÒIt canÕt be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen,Ó she said. ÒThe birther lie was a very hurtful one.Ó  Apparently worried that Trump would be on his best behavior, Clinton started her barrage early. She suggested that TrumpÕs success is inherited, and that heÕs hiding his tax returns to avoid embarrassment.  ÒMaybe heÕs not as rich as he says he is,Ó she said. ÒMaybe heÕs not as charitable as he claims to be.Ó  Trump didnÕt even bother to deny ClintonÕs suggestion that he hasnÕt paid income taxes Òfor a lot of years,Ó turning even that into an argument against the status quo.  ÒIt would be squandered too, believe me,Ó Trump said.  Clinton also found a groove in attacking Trump on Iraq. Trump again insisted that he was against the Iraq War before it started, a statement for which there is no public record in support of his claim.  For his part, Trump took Clinton on consistently, attacking her on jobs, trade and national security, using her as a stand-in for politicians in general.  ÒI have a feeling that by the end of this evening, IÕm going to be blamed for everything that ever happened,Ó Clinton said at one point.  Trump: ÒWhy not?Ó  Clinton: ÒJust join the debate by saying more crazy things.Ó  Clinton had one of her better moments in declaring her fitness for office, keying off of TrumpÕs criticism of her for retreating from the campaign trail.  ÒDonald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did,Ó she said. ÒAnd you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think thatÕs a good thing.Ó  Later in the debate, Trump allowed that Clinton has experience, Òbut itÕs bad experience,Ó he said.  ÒThis country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience,Ó Trump said.  After the first extraordinary encounter between two extraordinarily unpopular nominees, the plays are clear. Clinton is putting her experience up against the anger Trump is channeling, anger that has two distinct sides to it.  They proved they can get under each otherÕs skin. But neither candidate proved that he or she has a winning message, not on the night of the first debate."	9/26/16	link	no factual content	yes	228	447	1471.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1041832262581666		9/27/16	link	mostly true	yes	25	184	561.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1041861279245431		9/27/16	link	mostly true	yes	8	137	671.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1041943452570547		9/27/16	link	mostly true	yes	3	66	331.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1041988969232662		9/27/16	link	mostly true		21	185	691.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1042018955896330		9/27/16	link	mostly true	yes	19	332	681.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1042112815886944		9/27/16	link	mostly true	yes	14	184	1071.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1042165485881677		9/27/16	link	mostly true		76	387	591.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1042203689211190		9/27/16	link	mostly true		7	76	91.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1042236372541255		9/27/16	link	mostly true		7	29	61.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1042266479204911		9/27/16	link	mostly true		9	39	81.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1042295002535392		9/27/16	link	mostly true	yes	5	68	421.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1042315892533303		9/27/16	link	mostly true	yes	65	461	901.84E+14	1.04E+15	mainstream	ABC News Politics	https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/posts/1042362422528650		9/27/16	link	mostly true		1	19	31.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1446522352054899		9/19/16	link	mostly true		130	1032	3821.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1446620375378430	"Eric Trump makes up one-half of the Trump Brothers Brain trust, a pair of imbeciles who think continuing to make mediocre business deals off of their grandfatherÕs inheritance and shooting endangered animals make them too cool for their own shoes.

He tried to pivot away from the question at hand and made himself look really foolish.  Here is the exchange:  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel  Anderson Cooper: YouÕve previously called Hillary Clinton  a bigot. How is she a bigot?  Trump: Well, sheÕs a bigot.  Anderson Cooper: But, how is she bigoted? Bigotry is having a hatred towards a particular group.  Trump: SheÕs not doing anything for those communities.  Anderson Cooper: (Again) So, youÕre saying she has hatred or dislike of black people?  Trump: Her policies are bigoted.  Anderson Cooper: But, you said her policies are Òpersonally bigoted.Ó  Trump: Oh she is. Of course she is. SheÕs totally bigoted thereÕs no question about that.

John Kasich doesnÕt give a shit about PriebusÕ pathetic threats.  On Sunday, the GOP Chair suggested that Republicans who donÕt fall in line behind Trump could be severely punished in their endeavors to seek election or re-election.

In order to be on the ballot in South Carolina, you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee, no matter who that person is. So whatÕs the penalty for that? ItÕs not a threat, but thatÕs just the question that we have a process in place.Ó  Kasich has repeatedly refused to endorse Donald Trump and did not take kindly to PriebusÕ threat, issuing a brutal response through his spokesman John Weaver.  ÒThankfully, there are still leaders in this country who put principles before politics. The idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like Reince Priebus, but it is at the center of everything Governor Kasich doesÉThe Governor is traveling the nation supporting down ballot Republicans and preventing a potential national wipeout from occurring on ReinceÕs watch.Ó  Weaver also added that Priebus should be thanking Kasich.  So the next time John Kasich seeks re-election or high office itÕs going to be interesting to watch how Priebus responds. Will he follow through on his threat or will he do an about-face and all of a sudden support Kasich?  Threatening someone with political ruin just because they donÕt support the terrible choice of nominee your party made sounds more like what dictators or fascists do. ItÕs definitely not the hallmark of a party that supposedly supports our democracy. Because by trying to force Republicans to vote a certain way, they are undermining democracy and all the values this country was founded upon.  If anyone deserves political backlash, itÕs Reince Priebus. He created a political atmosphere so toxic that they now have Trump as their leader.

After placing Flint under state control, officials chose to save money by switching the cityÕs drinking water from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which has not been the drinking water source for decades because it was poisoned and considered unsafe for human consumption.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel As a result, the city has been devastated by lead poisoning, which will have terrible consequences for years to come for the children who ingested the tainted water.  Understandably, Flint is mad as hell so they decided to take the state to court. But because Michigan Republicans and Governor Rick Snyder are rats who hate democracy and justice, they shut down any potential lawsuit by stripping Flint of the power to sue.  According to the Detroit Free Press:  Though Flint has not been under a state-appointed emergency manager since April 2015, the state still exerts partial control over the city through a five-member Receivership Transition Advisory Board, whose members are appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder.  The board moved quickly to change the rules under which Flint is governed so that the city cannot file a lawsuit without first getting approval from that state-appointed board.  This is absolutely outrageous. ItÕs like a woman having to get permission to file a lawsuit from the company whose CEO raped her.  Michigan Republicans should not have the power to take away anyoneÕs right to seek redress through the court system. It sounds like they are just scared that they will lose the case. And frankly, they should be.  After all, it was their decisions that led to Flint being poisoned with tainted water and the cover-up that followed. The city of Flint absolutely should be able to sue the state in open court. But Republicans took that power away from Flint, and you can be damn sure that they would love to do that in every city across all fifty states if they have their way.

It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people donÕt do, to find out the real story Ð and the real story is that there is no pay to play.  ÒIt was natural for people whoÕve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldnÕt do anything they shouldnÕt do,Ó Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning.   Source: CNN  In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesnÕt mean theyÕll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but thereÕs no evidence they got them.  Now, letÕs talk about the foundation the media doesnÕt like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasnÕt given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating TrumpÕs charitable foundation over concerns that it Òengaged in some improprietyÓ as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled othersÕ contributions Òto make them appear to have come from himÓ although he ÒhasnÕt given to the foundation since 2008.Ó  Source: Media Matters  Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of ClintonÕs candidacy:  Journalists have been criticized for the Òdouble standardÓ in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to ClintonÕs pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington PostÕs reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald TrumpÕs Dr. Oz stunt.  All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton ÒscandalÓ (if you call getting sick a ÒscandalÓ) while ignoring every scandal in TrumpÕs closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Donald Trump attacked New York Times writer Maureen Dowd on Twitter for a negative story Ñ  a routine practice for the Republican presidential nominee. HeÕs blacklisted reporters throughout the election and treated them so badly theyÕve had to be escorted out of his rallies by Secret Service officers. He says he wants to Òopen upÓ libel laws, which would weaken journalistsÕ ability to report hard-hitting stories. He sued websites for writing that his wife and the potential first lady was rumored to be a Slovenian hooker. And Monday, Trump made a comment about the press that is arguably one of his worst yet.  In an interview with ÒFox & FriendsÓ on Fox News, Trump was speaking about the latest terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey that occurred over the weekend. After blaming refugees, despite there being absolutely no evidence the refugee program is to blame, the hosts mentioned that people donÕt need to be radicalized in Syria or Iraq because they can simply go online to be indoctrinated by terrorist groups.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel Trump turned his sites on a constitutionally protected right, the freedom of press and expression:  ÒTheyÕre all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, itÕs called Ôfreedom of the press,Õ where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw.Ó  Trump then said he was totally in favor of freedom of the press, then turned right around and shat on freedom of the press saying they are Òinciting violence.Ó  ÒThey tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people that do that because theyÕre participating in crime. Instead, they say Ôoh no you canÕt do anything, thatÕs freedom of expression.Õ Ó  And Trump also alluded to the fact that information on the internet should not be freely available (kind of like China):  ÒThe websites are the same thing, those people should be arrested. TheyÕre inciting violence, okay? TheyÕre making violence possible. They should be arrested immediatelyÉyet we donÕt want to touch them because of freedom of speech.Ó  Incitement is not a constitutionally protected right, but itÕs hard to prove that by making information available a website owner or writer is intentionally inciting a specific crime. But if the bar is lowered, Trump himself could be arrested for incitement, after telling his supporters to take out protesters at his rallies, or his comment that ÒSecond Amendment peopleÓ could stop Clinton.  TrumpÕs problem with the media is troubling. Using these latest attacks to go after constitutionally protected freedoms reeks of Bush-era fear-mongering that led to the U.S. giving up privacy rights to the government. Trump has left a long trail of breadcrumbs showing us heÕs on a path to destroy the First Amendment as we know it.  Freedom of expression and press is considered to be the fourth pillar of democracy in this country, without those freedoms the press is just a propaganda machine for the person in power. Only a small man fears information.

In the wake of the bombing in New York City over the weekend, police were able to apprehend a suspect named Ahmad Khan Rahami after a shootout.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel Rahami was hit and needed to be hospitalized to get his gunshot wound treated. And as an American citizen, he is also guaranteed the right to an attorney even if he cannot afford one.  Why? Because the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Constitution say so.  But Republican nominee Donald Trump thinks the amendments should be scrapped in RahamiÕs case. You know, because heÕs a Muslim.  During a rally in Florida on Monday, Trump whined because Rahami is being treated in a hospital for his wound and further complained about him being represented by a competent defense attorney.  ÒNow we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And heÕll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer. His case will go through the various court systems for years and in the end, people will forget and his punishment will not be what it once would have been. What a sad situation.Ó  Trump, who advocates for torture techniques, also demanded a speedy trial resulting in Òharsh punishmentÓ and suggested using Òwhatever lawful methods are available to obtain information from the apprehended suspect to get information before itÕs no longer timely.Ó  HereÕs the video via YouTube.    The Fifth Amendment states:  No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand juryÉnor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.  Rahami is innocent until proven guilty. So not letting him get the treatment he needs could lead to him dying from an infection or loss of blood, thus depriving him of life without due process.  Furthermore, the Sixth Amendment clearly gives everyone the right to an attorney, even a bombing suspect.  In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.  The right to have an attorney is one of the most foundational values of the country, most exemplified by Founding Father John Adams, who defended the British soldiers who were arrested after the Boston Massacre in 1770.  In short, it doesnÕt matter who the suspect is or what they did, they have the right to due process and an attorney in this country.

This revelation came from Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy announced the news on Facebook yesterday when she posted a picture  shaking hands next to Bush Sr with this caption: ÒThe President told me heÕs voting for Hillary!!Ó  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel This is actually not very shocking when you consider how much the Bushes have shown their contempt for Trump, after ruining their chances of continuing their political dynasty with low-energy Jeb.

Bush is voting for? He lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, and his son is George W. Bush. Yet it seems that the elder Bush finds Trump so distasteful a candidate that heÕs actually going to cast his vote for Hillary Clinton.  According to Politico, Bush Sr. had originally planned on keeping quiet about this election. Considering the fact that heÕs a Republican, and therefore expected to weigh in on the side of the RepublicansÕ chosen candidate, this is actually pretty major. But it wasnÕt Bush himself who revealed his vote. It was Kathleen Kennedy TownsendÑdaughter of the late Robert KennedyÑwho let this particular interesting tidbit slip:  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel ÒOn Monday, Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption: ÔThe President told me heÕs voting for Hillary!!'Ó  She stood by that later on when talking to Politico.

A spokesman for the Bush family refused to actually confirm this Ð he said that George H.W.Õs vote is a private decision and will remain so. He himself isnÕt commenting, but it seems that those who are in his inner circle arenÕt being so tight-lipped, if Kennedy is to be believed.  Bush Sr. did make it clear back in May that he had absolutely zero intention of endorsing Trump. ThatÕs a bold, but wise, move for any Republican, since Republicans are supposed to be on the side of freedom and Trump is on the side of dictatorship and authoritarianism.  His love of Russian president Vladimir Putin would suggest that heÕs also on the side of autocracy. None of these three things meshes with the democracy Republicans say weÕve built in even the smallest way.  Earlier in the summer, an administration official for George W. Bush announced that she would vote for Hillary, adding her name to an ever-growing list of Republicans and conservatives who canÕt find it within themselves to support Trump. Jeb Bush has said he can neither vote for Hillary nor Trump.  A former Republican president refusing to stand for the current Republican nominee is a stinging blow indeed.

He didnÕt promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.  LetÕs imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. ÒDestroyÓ doesnÕt leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty Òyeeeeehaw,Ó the reality is that heÕs talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America.

Just because heÕs a suspect in a bombing doesnÕt mean heÕs guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked ÒkillÓ and not on the most wanted list. ThereÕs nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.  What that means is that under TrumpÕs dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think IÕm being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isnÕt about the narrative. It isnÕt about prevention or education.  ItÕs about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.  The only solace we have is that what heÕs promising is nothing but another Òread my lips.Ó Terrorism isnÕt something you can simply ÒdestroyÓ just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isnÕt going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism.

ÒThe United States has relayed our regret through the Russian Federation for the unintentional loss of life of Syrian forces,Ó an Obama administration official announced at the time, according to Mediaite. However, the Russians, who appear to really want a Trump administration, criticized the bombings, even though again, they raised no objections when they were consulted before the incident took place.  Russian diplomats then floated a Trump conspiracy theory, because of course:  After the botched strike, Russian diplomats floated a Trump conspiracy theory that the Obama administration is actively helping ISIS. In fact, wherever the Islamic State abuts his enemies, Assad has actively assisted them with his own air power, while Putin has pursued a policy of allowing extremists to leave Russia and join ISIS.  Donald offered no alternatives as to how he would prevent a botched bombing. He just says the word ÔwinÕ repeatedly and his supporters eat it up. So does Vladimir Putin, apparently.

Now, a federal judge, the same one Trump insulted during a recent rally, has ordered that Trump University documents be released.  TrumpÕs attorneys tried to avoid this outcome by claiming that the documents they were requesting included important trade secrets.  But that didnÕt stop Judge Gonzalo Curiel.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel The result of this decision could certainly be damaging for the Trump campaign.  While Trump can brush many things off his back for some unknown reason, the idea of a fraud university that tricked college-aged students and put them into debt is rather disturbing.  Furthermore, Judge Curiel stated that part of the reason he wanted the documents released is the public interest in TrumpÕs case.  ItÕs clear that Trump has felt threatened by this whole ordeal.  For 12 whole minutes of a 58 minute speech, Trump insulted this judge and claimed he wasnÕt playing fair.  Citing the fact that this judge was appointed by President Obama, and that he has made rulings against Trump, Trump claims he is biased.  He also indirectly insinuated that the judge is biased because he is ÒMexicanÓ (which actually isnÕt true at all, even if that mattered Ð heÕs from the US).  Trump University was started in 2004 as a firm to offer courses and workshops in entrepreneurship.  The University used the Trump brand and marketed it as an opportunity to be a apprentice of Trump himself.  Trump became a 93% owner of the enterprise and has benefitted from its profits.  The problem is that many students believe they have not benefitted from the instruction.  The university is not accredited, you canÕt earn a degree, and yet thousands of students took out tens of thousands of dollars worth of loans to attend.  Several lawsuits were placed against the ÒuniversityÓ by its students.  The state of New York even placed their complaints against Trump University.  The state filed a $40 million lawsuit saying the school gave Òfalse promisesÓ.  The New York State Board of Education claimed it was Òmisleading and even illegalÓ to call the firm a university.  As a result, the name changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.  Around 80,000 people have been documented as attending free introductory seminars, while 9000 paid $1,500 for three-day seminars.  All of that doesnÕt sound too bad, but take into account that 800 people paid around $35,000 for larger packages such as mentorship programs.  In the lawsuit by the state of New York, under New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, it was alleged that Trump defrauded over 5,000 individuals.  In a script only Trump could use, he claimed in marketing videos for the school that:  ÒWe are going to have professors and adjust professors that are absolutely terrificÉand these are all people who are going to be handpicked by me.Ó  Michael Sexton, one of the top executives of the institution, said himself that Ònone of the professors at the live eventsÓ were actually picked by Trump.  The story and lawsuit of Trump University may just be one of the most symbolic things about the Trump candidacy and the man himself.  He uses his name recognition and the perception of wealth and success to further his interests.  ItÕs essentially ÒIÕm rich because IÕm rich, now give me more money/power because IÕm richÓ.  By tagging his name along with the name of an unaccredited educational institution, thousands of people were duped into believing it would be worth their money.  If Trump University had been named the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative all along, perhaps the allegations would seem more hollow.  After all, people pay for overpriced seminars and workshops all the time.  However, naming the institution ÒTrump UniversityÓ gives it the illusion that it is the kind of place a student could come to get a degree in lieu of another college.  That is just simply not the case.  In the end, this lawsuit could end in Trump losing tens of millions of dollars, along with tens of millions of votes.  ThatÕs a huge chunk of his fortune given that, depending on who listen to, some analysts estimate he is only worth between 20-70 million in terms of cash, assets and bonds.  He himself claims he is worth several billion, but the truth is probably somewhere in-between.

Bush Is Voting For Hillary (VIDEO) By Vera on September 21, 2016 10:46 am á Months ago, former First Lady Laura Bush shocked Americans when she said sheÕd rather vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton than a Republican this election. For the most part, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush have opted to stay out of this election Ð until now.  Word of George H.W. BushÕs decision to snub the GOP by not voting for its disastrous Republican nominee just recently broke, and itÕs a super provocative move because not only is Bush refusing to support his party, but he is voting for the Democratic Party instead.

Conway said that although she ÔrespectsÕ BushÕs choice, itÕs ironic that heÕs voting for Òthe wife of the man who knocked him out of the raceÓ in 1992. Conway also chalked up BushÕs decision to vote for Clinton to his emotions and Òhurt feelingsÓ over his sonÕs loss to Trump in the primaries.

During his show on Tuesday night, Jimmy Kimmel ran yet another ÒLie Witness NewsÓ segment featuring Trump supporters being asked questions based on the false story of him finally releasing his tax returns.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel The Kimmel reporter on the street asked Trump fans what they think now that the tax returns reveal that Trump is close with Putin, leases his wife Melania, writes off gold-plated toilets as a business expense, and supports child molester Jared Fogle.  As it turns out, every single Trump supporter said they are still voting for the Republican nominee no matter what, even if it is true that Trump contributed to the legal defense fund of a convicted child molester. In fact, his supporters made excuses for Trump in order to justify his actions.  So when Donald Trump said that he could go out and shoot someone dead in broad daylight in the middle of Fifth Avenue and not lose any votes, he was right.  Because TrumpÕs supporters were not fazed by any of the claims presented to them. They were even okay with him lying on his returns by listing his occupation as a farmer.  Seriously.

Sadly, this accidental admission that his views on the PresidentÕs birthplace and eligibility for office had not changed one iota is perhaps the most honest thing Trump has said lately, with much of his attention being focused on defending the Trump FoundationÕs misuse of charitable funds to pay The DonaldÕs personal legal fees, attacking African-American communities, and practically publicly masturbating over the recent attacks in New York and New Jersey.

Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.  It hasnÕt been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that weÕve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was ÒPapaÓ John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employeesÕ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didnÕt.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesnÕt get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of CarlÕs Jr. and HardeeÕs. HereÕs one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:    Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But thatÕs not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesnÕt want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:  ÒI want to try it,Ó CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. ÒWe could have a restaurant thatÕs focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.Ó  ÒWith government driving up the cost of labor, itÕs driving down the number of jobs,Ó he says. ÒYouÕre going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.Ó  ÒThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,Ó says Puzder. ÒDoes it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?Ó  Source: Yahoo Finance  This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. HeÕs hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.  Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.  Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees donÕt see any of that.

During IRS Commissioner John KoskinenÕs hearing, Democrats began ignoring the ÒimpeachmentÓ nonsense and focused entirely on getting to the bottom of Donald TrumpÕs numerous tax scandals, including specific questions about his tax returns and charity fraud.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel Of particular interest was TrumpÕs stated excuse for not releasing his tax returns because he is under audit. Tax experts have long noted that this argument is complete nonsense. An audit does not preclude the ability to show the American people your finances before an election. The head of the IRS Ð who presumably knows a thing or two about this Ð agreed.  ÒIs there anything that would prohibit someone from releasing tax returns, if they want to, because theyÕre under audit?Ó Rep. Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York asked.  ÒNo,Ó Koskinen responded simply.  Another Democratic representative asked it another way.  ÒWould releasing the personÕs tax return during the audit in any way impact that pending audit of the return?Ó Rep. Ted Deutch asked.  ÒThe release itself wouldnÕt. The concern sometimes by taxpayers is that when the information is public there may be more information that will be discovered or provided,Ó Koskinen said.  In other words, Trump was worried that releasing his tax returns could make him look bad, or possibly allow nosy reporters to find even more criminality that the IRS missed the first time. This answer actually confirms what TrumpÕs son suggested to reporters in an unusual break from his dad. It wasnÕt the audit that scares Trump, itÕs that reporters seeing the tax returns would allow them to discover whatÕs in them and that would destroy his fatherÕs chances of becoming president.  It may be for this reason that Trump has hinted he will only release his tax returns after the election. It wonÕt matter then.  The beatings continued in earnest while Republicans were forced to sit there with ÒWhat have we done?Ó expressions painted on their faces.  Democrats then went on to highlight some of the items that could prove problematic for Trump to disclose, such as his actual income, what he pays the government in taxes, clues to his actual net worth and records of his charitable giving.  Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) wondered aloud if discovering payments by Russia might suggest a monetary _ or even treasonous _ motive for going soft on a U.S. rival.  Several also raised the recent reports of Trump using his tax-free foundation to to buy paintings and sports memorabilia, to fund political campaigns and to pay business expenses.  ÒIs it appropriate for a foundation to give political donations?Ó asked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas).  The answer was no. Rep. Luis Gutierrez smiled in the face of Republican discomfort at the questions while munching on a bag of Skittles (a not-so-subtle nod to Trump Jr.Õs recent comparison of Syrian refugees to poisoned candy). He later clarified that, unlike some people, he wouldnÕt stop eating Skittles if he got a bad one.  It was not a good day to be a Republican lawmaker.  The IRS commissioner is facing a Republican-orchestrated impeachment due to what they say was a cover up to hide IRS targeting of conservative groups. The minor detail that no evidence of the IRS head actually targeting conservative groups actually exists didnÕt seem to bother them.  The impeachment hearing, widely agreed to be a dog-and-pony show, came after Republican leaders managed to stop an embarrassing impeachment vote on the House floor which would have humiliated the GOP with yet another stark example for the American voters of how frivolous and dysfunctional the party has become. They settled for grandstanding.  So with the knowledge that Republicans were wasting everyoneÕs time, Democrats decided to use those wasted hours to highlight just how corrupt Donald Trump is. Waste not, want not.  Watch the IRS hearing, starting with Rep. NadlerÕs investigation into TrumpÕs lies, here:"	9/22/16	link	mixture of true and false		709	2951	821.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1450101775030290	"TRUMP SUPPORTERS OFFER OUTRAGEOUS CONSPIRACY THEORIES TO DAILY SHOW REPORTER (VIDEO)  15705 SHARES If there is one thing you can say about Trump supporters, it is that they are sure about what they donÕt know. And what they donÕt know can fill volumes, as evidenced by the latest conversation with some of them, shared on the September 20 episode of Comedy CentralÕs The Daily Show.  You canÕt blame these people for some of the conspiracy theories they believe Ñ many of those theories started in right-wing media, like Fox News.

He is referring to a long debunked story that claimed that the president stopped wearing his watch and wedding ring in observance of Ramadan. But thereÕs no restriction prohibiting Muslims from wearing jewelry during the holy month, except in this manÕs mind. So the president appearing sans watch and wedding ring proves absolutely nothing.

Republicans would like all inherited money to be completely sheltered from any taxation, while for the most part, Democrats disagree. The compromise has been that only estates valued at a whopping $5.45 million or more ($10.9 million for married couples) are taxed. Anything below that is completely tax free.  Now, Hillary Clinton, after prodding from Bernie Sanders and his followers, has revised her estate tax plan and trust me when I say Donald TrumpÕs children wonÕt be happy.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel Previously, Clinton said she would restore the tax on dead rich folks to its 2009 levels, pushing up the rate from 40 percent to 45 percent, and making it kick in for estates worth at least $3.5 million (today, it only hits those valued at $5.45 million or more). But, no longer. Instead, sheÕs borrowed a page from her formal primary rival, and now proposes turning the levy into a progressive taxÑmeaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estatesÑwith a top rate of 65 percent. The last time the estate tax hit that level was in 1982, though back then it also kicked in on smaller inheritances.  Beyond all that, Clinton has said she would largely do away with the step-up in basis at death, a rule that allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that, say, their parents or uncle or other rich benefactor would have owed had they sold their stock before passing away.  In the end, the committee expects these measures to raise about $225 billion over ten years.  Source: Slate  As it stands, the estate tax system is a joke. In 2012, a staggering $1.2 trillion was passed down as an inheritance. Of that, less than 1 percent was taxed. As for the Republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses, in 2013, only 20 small businesses and family farm estates, in the entire country, had to pay estate taxes.  The other common Republican argument is that estate taxes are Òdouble taxationÓ (as if every other dollar in the American economy hasnÕt been taxed multiple times), but the reality is that most of what comprises large estates comes from capital gains, which are also unlikely to have every been taxed.  Of course, even if Clinton is elected, sheÕll have a tough time passing this, at least as long as Paul Ryan is in charge of the House. He wants TrumpÕs kids to pay zero in estate taxes. Of course, for all we know, Trump himself pays zero in taxes."	9/22/16	link	no factual content		205	2197	981.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1450910671616067	"Trump Blames Charlotte Rioting On Drug Use, Without Any Proof By Ryan Denson on September 22, 2016 4:58 pm á Another day, another racist dog whistle echoed by Donald Trump. While the urban unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina continues, Trump Ð in a pathetic attempt to sound presidential Ð blamed the rioting on drug use, without citing any facts to back up his claim.  The comment, made in a speech in Pittsburgh, was off-script:  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel ÒIf youÕre not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what youÕre watching on television.Ó  Somehow, everyone but Donald Trump is unaware of the ÒfactorsÓ contributing to a legitimate unrest that stems not from drugs, but from the black community being continuously fed up with racial injustices and the murders of unarmed men who posed no credible threat to law enforcement.  What Donald Trump is seeking to do is sow the seeds of a racist, stereotype that plagues this country: blacks are on drugs, and it makes them violent.  The facts are out there: white people do more drugs, and serve less time. This notion that because black Americans are fed up with injustice is somehow attributed to drug use or a yearning for drugs is, yes, racist. It reaffirms peopleÕs ignorant and misguided stereotypes about urban black communities while simultaneously deflecting from other drug crises that are affecting white communities at much more critical levels.  Recent findings in the American Journal of Public Health, the abuse and dependency on Òhard drugsÓ are Òless common among delinquent African American youth than those who are non-Hispanic white.Ó White people, in general, are also more likely to deal drugs than black people. So the people selling drugs to our kids, parents, and members of the community are more likely to be white than black, but yet black people are still seen as the culprits of AmericaÕs drug problem.  And Donald TrumpÕs claim, no matter how minuscule it may be, just makes the problem worse.  Instead of accusing black Americans of being drug-induced degenerates, maybe Trump should travel up to New Hampshire and Maine, where an unprecedented opioid addiction is killing hundreds of white citizens every year, and nothing is being done to combat it.  Donald Trump says the unrest in Charlotte would not happen in a Trump administration. Would New EnglandÕs drug epidemic be stopped under his administration? Would the killing of unarmed black people Ð which is the only contribution to the unrest Ð stop in his administration? Would he end the dog whistle stereotypes that continue to blatantly fester in peopleÕs minds, regardless of what the facts are?

She insisted that racism was literally non-existent before Obama was elected.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel Wow, it doesnÕt take much to tear apart how this assertion is completely absurd, but weÕre going to take the time to do it anyway.  In an interview with The Guardian, Kathy Miller, the campaign chair in question, made the following shocking statement:  ÒI donÕt think there was any racism until Obama got elected.  We never had problems like this.Ó  She must mean that white people were relatively shielded from being forced to face the fact that racism is, in fact, abound in white culture.  Even though that, in all honestly, is a load of bunk too.  She went on to make some extremely offensive statements to the black community overall, willfully remaining ignorant of how many hardships Black Americans face every. single. day:  ÒIf youÕre black and you havenÕt been successful in the last 50 years, itÕs your own fault.  YouÕve had every opportunity, it was given to you.  YouÕve had the same schools everybody else went to.  You had benefits to go to college that white kids didnÕt have.  You had all the advantages and didnÕt take advantage.  ItÕs not our fault, certainly.Ó  *Cringe*  Seeing as apparently this isnÕt evident to people like Kathy Miller, and arguably much of TrumpÕs voter base, letÕs just go through why this is completely bogus and extremely offensive.  She even went so far as to say that racism didnÕt exist when she grew upÉin the 1960s.  What?!  Segregation?!?!  Black people have had to deal with a racist criminal justice system which unfairly targets their community, damaging their families and placing their children at a disadvantage from the very beginning.  Black children have primarily had to go to schools which are dominated by a white power structure, a power structure which has certainly not gotten rid of its racist roots to this day.  Either that, or they often go to a school which is worse off economically.  Black people were literally enslaved or cut off from the resources and wealth of the white by law for centuries.  The racist nature within that legal system wasnÕt just erased with the end of segregation.  Has it improved?  Sure, but that hasnÕt addressed the structural racism within our socio-political and economic paradigm.  Because of a history of oppression, black people have been economically much worse off.  And children who come from poor families, as study after study shows, statistically do worse in school.  They also canÕt afford skyrocketing college tuition when they get out of high school.  Black children are often disproportionately punished in schools, which harms their potential for academic success.  Honestly, I could go on and on, and IÕm not even black, so I donÕt know the half of it.

His ability to say, with a straight face, obvious lies that a typical human would find impossible due to a profound sense of shame make his appearance on the debate stage a singular moment in history.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel Matt Lauer recently held what was billed as the ÒpreviewÓ of the debates with a one-on-one sit down with both candidates for an extended question-and-answer session. While Lauer grilled Clinton on her voting record and on (*sigh*) the emails, when it came time to question Trump he turned into a doormat.  Critics slammed the embarrassing way Lauer allowed Trump to lie to his face without any pushback. In one particularly blatant example, Trump falsely claimed that he had been opposed to the Iraq War from the very beginning, an easily debunked lie that Lauer was surely aware of.  The debates, many Americans hoped, would be different. If Trump chooses to openly lie to voters during the events, moderators should be expected to jump in and clarify the falsehoods.  Needless to say, the person making the most noise about this change of plans isÉDonald Trump.  In an interview with Fox News, Trump claimed there would be people ÒwatchingÓ for moderators to fact check him and would react badly if he wasnÕt allowed to say whatever he wanted.  First, Trump slammed Candy Crawley, who famously corrected Mitt Romney during a debate with President Obama. It has often been seen as a pivotal moment in that debate and the real-time fact check threw Romney off of his game for the rest of the night.  Trump would prefer he and Clinton get a chance to fight it out without interference, even if what he is saying are lies.  You know, I think thereÕs a lot of pressure on [first debate moderator Lester Holt]. I think LesterÕs a very good person, a very good man. I think thereÕs a lot of pressure on him. You know, when I had the town hall, last week with Hillary, I did well, and I had tough questions. But the polls all had her taking a drubbingÉ.They went after Matt Lauer, and IÕve never seen anything like itÉ.ThatÕs what theyÕre doing with Lester HoltÉand a lot of people are watching to see whether he succumbs to that pressure. The difference between TrumpÕs camp and ClintonÕs couldnÕt be more apparent here. While Democrats are demanding the truth be the focal point of the night, conservatives Ð including Trump himself Ð are telling moderators that they should not worry about what is a lie and what isnÕt.  As the Washington PostÕs Greg Sergent noted:  In other words, one side wants the moderators to hold the candidates accountable, and the other doesnÕt. We can argue endlessly over whether those in the former camp are trying to game the debates so that Trump faces tougher questioning than Clinton does. But the bottom line is that, given that it is simply true that Trump lies a lot more frequently, audaciously, and egregiously than Clinton does, and that it took many months before this was widely acknowledged in the press, most Clinton supporters would probably be just fine with equivalent treatment of both of their assertions at the debate, and if they arenÕt, they should be. Republicans want Trump to lie. Democrats simply want both sides to tell the truth. ItÕs rare in politics to find such a clear contrast."	9/23/16	link	mixture of true and false	yes	2426	5873	10211.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1451263971580737		9/23/16	link	mostly true		115	721	1951.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1451304671576667		9/23/16	link	mostly true		258	1900	4251.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1451600428213758		9/23/16	link	no factual content		234	645	501.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1451738378199963		9/23/16	link	mostly true		513	1685	9831.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1451779101529224		9/23/16	link	mostly true		98	518	1351.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1451804061526728		9/23/16	link	mostly true		266	766	1581.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1451890218184779		9/23/16	link	mostly true		104	1226	1191.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1451956254844842		9/23/16	link	mostly true		123	1180	881.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1451961101511024		9/23/16	link	mostly true		465	2116	1861.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1451988724841595		9/23/16	link	mostly true		5028	4650	6601.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1452012371505897		9/23/16	link	mostly true		420	1373	1811.46E+14	1.45E+15	left	Addicting Info	https://www.facebook.com/AddictingInfoOrg/posts/1452117881495346	"The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ÔTerrorismÕ By Wendy Gittleson on September 23, 2016 3:58 pm á Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano RooseveltÕs infamous line, Òwe have nothing to fear but fear itself,Ó the Pope chastised fear-based media.  Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of ÒterrorismÓ and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday.  Spreading rumors is an example of Òterrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongueÓ, he said. ÒThis is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.Ó  Source: Reuters  Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to ItalyÕs press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but IÕm sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and thatÕs what has given us Donald Trump.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel Crime in the nation is down. An AmericanÕs odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:  Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant.  Source: The Atlantic  Sure, thatÕs about Donald Trump and the Pope wasnÕt directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, theyÕve succeeded.

Well, it seems that the Trump campaign realized what a sleazy and inappropriate move this was on the part of their candidate, and campaign surrogates and officials have been out in force to make sure that the whole world knows that Trump will not have Flowers there as his guest.  Trump campaign manager number three and official Trump whisperer Kellyane Conway said of the ruckus:  ÒWe do not expect her to be a guest of the Trump campaign.Ó Conway went on to spew the bullshit excuse that thereÕs no way that Hillary will ever get under TrumpÕs skin:  ÒMr. Trump was putting them on notice that we could certainly invite guests that make it into the head of Hillary Clinton.Ó The thing is, this is just disgusting. Hillary made the PERSONAL decision to stay with her husband, as many women do, after he had an affair. This nonsense is decades old, and should be in no way relevant to the 2016 race for the White House. This is something that is a low blow, sexist and is in no way appropriate for a serious political campaign.  TrumpÕs flirting with this invitation for Flowers to attend the debate is nothing more than a misogynist attempt to shame a woman for her personal decision to forgive the man she loves for mistakes within a marriage. In other words, itÕs not appropriate to drag it up, and it is none of the publicÕs business. Further, it CERTAINLY has NOTHING to do with the current election.

This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable Ð except by Hillary Clinton.  But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics É. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.  After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.  The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:  For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator É to call out those lies and to do that in real time.  Unfortunately, with TrumpÕs impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, itÕs somehow up to Hillary Clinton to ÒshineÓ at the debate if she hopes to Òwin.Ó This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.  Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

The whole thing was one brilliant insult against Trump after another. Here are a few of the better tweets:   Follow  Bill Maher _ @billmaher GOP won expectations game when it nominated an orangutan.

And just as expected, there was some much pent up sparring. Once the evening had concluded, it was evident who won that debate, no questions asked: Hillary Clinton.  No one should be surprised. While the media has been speculating that viewers would once again see a ÒTrump pivot,Ó the facts remain the same Ñ what we saw on the debate stage was the same Trump we saw during the Republican primaries Ñ a brash, condescending, loudmouthed bully who has no plans, only talking points.  Subscribe to our Youtube Channel All the pundits know it. The polls know it. The people know it. Hillary Clinton won because she was prepared, she was eloquent, and she kept her cool. But not surprisingly, Trump and his band of surrogates didnÕt get the memo. They think they won. Because why not?  Trump (and his people) say Lester Holt was unfair. They say the microphone was tampered with. They say Hillary Clinton was Òtoo preparedÓ so it was an unfair advantage. They say the media was too biased.  Excuse after excuse, Trump refuses to take responsibility for his actions. he was unprepared, he was disrespectful, he couldnÕt elaborate, and he got personal.  But enough about Trump and his candy-ass excuses. LetÕs talk about why Hillary Clinton was clearly the winner.  She was prepared   Look no further than her best zinger of the night: ÒI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think thatÕs a good thing.Ó ItÕs been reported that Clinton immersed herself with the issues of our times, poring over research, conducting rehearsals, and doing her homework. Trump, on the other hand, was taking a casual, passive approach to the debates, and it showed. He couldnÕt elaborate, he didnÕt show decorum, and he didnÕt know how to respond to ClintonÕs assertions Ñ except with lies.  She was tough, yet composed  The bar was set pretty low due to Trump. Clinton knew she had to somewhat get on his level, but stay true to who she really is. This debate ended up being something special. She was up against a loud, bombastic, unpredictable bully who says whatever he pleases. Luckily for her, she didnÕt take any of his lies personally. She fact checked him when Holt wouldnÕt. She smiled politely as he sunk into the abyss with his never ending rambles. She wasnÕt Òtoo loudÓ as the pundits like to call it, but she was forceful when need be. And, even though itÕs a stupid assessment (but somehow matters), she smiled.  She respected Holt and upheld decorum   One of the reasons people hate debates is because they find that the moderators donÕt do their jobs. They allow the candidates to walk all over them, they go over their allotted time, they interrupt each other. It gets annoying. Luckily, Trump was in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton. She listened to Holt when he told her that her time was up, and rarely interrupted Holt to attack Trump. While Trump interrupted Clinton 51 times, she interrupted Trump only 17 times. At the end, Clinton shook HoltÕs hand, and Trump did not.  She was fundamentally honest  While TrumpÕs famous ÒCrooked HillaryÓ was front and center on Snapchat, the facts paint a different story. NPR, the non-partisan gold standard of whatÕs left of journalism, did an in-depth fact check analysis and showed that, surprise, Trump lied way more than Clinton, while ClintonÕs claims were mostly upheld as true.  She had the better plan  While Donald Trump painted America as third world, crime-riddled hellhole, Clinton offered us a hopeful, inspiring message of bringing back jobs, fixing broken race relations, and investigating in future generations. Her plan would create 10 million jobs Ñ his would cut 3.5 million. She wants to curb gun violence against black youth by holding them and communities (yes, that includes police officers) accountable. Trump wants to implement the unconstitutional and ineffective Stop and Frisk. Surprisingly, the agreed on several issues, such as the No-Fly gun ban, opposition to the TPP, and a need to bring jobs back from overseas. But simply put, her way, not ÒTrumped up trickle down,Ó will get us there.  This is why Clinton won. She was the stronger candidate, and she shined while everyone was hoping it would be the other way around. Trump devolved into his classic self as she increasingly got under his skin.  No, it wasnÕt HoltÕs fault. No, it wasnÕt the microphoneÕs fault. No, it wasnÕt HillaryÕs fault. It was TrumpÕs fault, plain and simple. Maybe heÕll take preparation a little more seriously for next time. Or maybe not. it is Trump, after all."	9/27/16	link	no factual content	yes	305	2351	1531.46E+14	1.46E+15	left	Addicting

Bush told her he's voting for -- wait for it -- Hillary Clinton.  Townsend, a Democrat who served as Maryland lieutenant governor for eight years and goes by Hartington online, posted a photo with the former president to Facebook: ""The President told me he's voting for Hillary!!"" wrote Kennedy Townsend, a niece of President John F. Kennedy. Jim McGrath, a spokesman for Bush, did not confirm nor deny the claim.  ""The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,"" McGrath told CNN. ""He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim."" Townsend met with Bush at the family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, during a board meeting for the bipartisan Points of Light Foundation. Sources with knowledge of the conversation told CNN's Jamie Gangel they were surprised and disappointed that she had publicly shared a private conversation with the former president.

Story highlights Bush's decision is a stunning political move Bush shared his plans during what he believed was a private gathering Monday (CNN)Former President George H.W. Bush said Monday that he will vote for Hillary Clinton in November, according to sources close to the 41st President -- an extraordinary rebuke of his own party's nominee.  The sources said this was not the first time Bush had disclosed his intention to vote for Clinton. The comments came during a receiving line for board members of the bipartisan Points of Light Foundation when Bush was speaking to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, Robert F. Kennedy's daughter and the former Maryland lieutenant governor. There were roughly 40 people in the room, and it's not clear how many people heard him, though multiple sources did. The Republican former president's embrace of the Democratic nominee represents a dramatic new chapter in the complicated three-decade-old relationship between the two most prominent families in American politics. It's a stunning political move -- one that comes just 49 days from the election, and less than a week before Clinton and Donald Trump square off in their first debate. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN's Erin Burnett Tuesday that she respects ""the 92-year-old former president very much and his decision."" ""It is ironic that he would vote for the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race,"" she added on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""But look, this was a bruising primary ... so I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there."" News of his support for Clinton came first on Facebook, when Kennedy Townsend posted a photo of herself with George H.W. Bush, along with the caption: ""The President told me he's voting for Hillary!!"" Kennedy Townsend sits on the advisory board of the Points of Light Foundation. Bush family representatives declined to respond publicly. ""The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim,"" Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement. But sources with knowledge of the conversation told CNN they were surprised and disappointed that Kennedy Townsend had publicly shared a private conversation with the former president. The Bush and Clinton relationship roller coaster  The Bush and Clinton relationship roller coaster 01:59 Kennedy Townsend declined to comment through a spokesman at the Rock Creek Group, where she works as managing director. She later took down the Facebook post. GOP's Trump divide Trump's controversial candidacy has split the group of former Republican nominees. Mitt Romney has hammered Trump in speeches and on Twitter, calling him unfit for office. But former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole has endorsed Trump, as has Arizona Sen. John McCain -- though somewhat reluctantly, often referring to ""the Republican nominee"" rather than Trump by name. Neither George H.W. Bush nor George W. Bush had weighed in on the general election -- even as Trump savaged George W. Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq. However, many of the 41st and 43rd presidents' Cabinet secretaries and national security officials have backed Clinton. George H.W. Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft endorsed Clinton in June, saying she ""has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time."" George W. Bush Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said on CNN in August that he ""would have preferred Jeb Bush, but I think Hillary is a great choice. I am afraid of what Donald Trump would do to this country."" Donald Trump&#39;s empire Photos: Donald Trump's rise And Louis Wade Sullivan, the Health and Human Services secretary under George H.W. Bush and the only African-American in his Cabinet, said this month that ""though my enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton is somewhat tempered, I certainly believe she is an infinitely better choice for president than Donald Trump."" But George H.W. Bush isn't speaking for his entire family. Marvin Bush, the former president's youngest son, has said he would vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson. George P. Bush, George H.W. Bush's grandson, has backed Trump. And Jeb Bush, Trump's former primary rival, has said he won't vote for Trump or Clinton. A representative for George W. Bush wouldn't comment on Kennedy Townsend's Facebook post or how George H.W. Bush would vote. The representative simply said George W. Bush is ""spending his time working to keep the Senate in Republican hands and is not commenting on the presidential campaign."" The Bush-Clinton relationship The evolving relationship between the Bush and Clinton families began in 1992, when Bill Clinton ran against -- and defeated -- incumbent President George H.W. Bush. Eight years later, with Clinton term-limited out of office, Bush's son, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, succeeded Clinton on a pledge to ""restore honor and dignity"" to the White House -- a not-so-subtle knock on Clinton's marital infidelity. A look at political families Photos: A look at political families But Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush have also spent their post-presidencies teaming up for philanthropic endeavors. And in recent years, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have increasingly appeared together. The two grew so close that George W. Bush has referred to Clinton as his ""brother from another mother,"" and Clinton has said the two bonded over becoming grandfathers. A Bush-Clinton matchup Early in the 2016 campaign cycle, it appeared the two families could be headed for another showdown with the presidency on the line: Hillary Clinton was seeking the Democratic nomination, while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- the 41st president's son and the 43rd president's brother -- was a Republican candidate and a fundraising powerhouse. Even if George H.W. Bush hadn't endorsed Hillary Clinton, it was hard to envision him backing Trump. Neither of the former Bush presidents attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where Trump became the GOP's nominee -- with the Bush family staying out of presidential politics after Jeb Bush, denounced repeatedly by Trump as ""low-energy,"" exited the race. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify the context in which George H.W. Bush made his comment about voting for Hillary Clinton."	9/20/16	link	mixture of true and false		271	1554	3752.19E+14	1.28E+15	mainstream	CNN Politics	https://www.facebook.com/cnnpolitics/posts/1283484068360090		9/20/16	link	mostly true		41	340	5332.19E+14	1.28E+15	mainstream	CNN Politics	https://www.facebook.com/cnnpolitics/posts/1283495701692260		9/20/16	link	mostly true		14	56	482.19E+14	1.28E+15	mainstream	CNN Politics	https://www.facebook.com/cnnpolitics/posts/1283507681691062		9/20/16	link	mostly true		5	39	472.19E+14	1.28E+15	mainstream	CNN Politics	https://www.facebook.com/cnnpolitics/posts/1283530558355441	"Introducing #MyVote: A nationwide social tour to Election Day  By Christina Manduley, CNN Updated 4:02 PM ET, Tue September 20, 2016 my vote cnn instagram ca tech facebook _00001225 Pause Current Time 0:00 / Duration Time 0:00 Progress: 0%0:00Fullscreen 00:00 Mute Configuration  Project #MyVote launches on CNN 00:34 Story highlights CNN's #MyVote camper and projection tour will cover swing states and presidential debate sites It's aimed at going beyond polls to provide voices of actual voters (CNN)CNN announced Monday a nationwide tour of key swing states, presidential debate sites and destinations around the country on the #MyVote camper and projection tour, in partnership with Instagram, Facebook and CA Technologies.  #MyVote launched steps from the White House at the Newseum in Washington, where the camper displayed the first in a series of campaign trail photos taken by the Instagram community via an immersive, one-of-a-kind virtual projection experience.

At the tour stops, members of the community are invited to enter the #MyVote camper and take a photo with either a red, blue or purple background filter. They can then share that photo on Instagram, using the #MyVote hashtag. CNN will be gathering the data collected on the tour and folding it into the election coverage.

PM ET, Fri September 23, 2016 U.S. troops in Iraq U.S. troops in Iraq Story highlights The forces would help in the effort to retake Mosul from ISIS No final decision has been reached yet by the Pentagon Washington, D.C. (CNN)The Pentagon is considering a proposal that could send an additional 500 troops to Iraq to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces take Mosul from ISIS in the coming weeks, a US defense official told CNN.  The possibility of sending some number of additional forces has been reported for several weeks, including by CNN. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the proposal centered around the possibility of up to 500 additional forces. No final decision has been made, the official said. If the proposal is approved, it is anticipated that would be the final wave of additional US forces for fighting ISIS, since Mosul remains the last major ISIS stronghold in Iraq, the official added. If the proposal is okayed, it will raise the ceiling on the number of US troops in Iraq from 4,647 to over 5,000. Several hundred additional troops move in and out of Iraq on temporary deployment orders. Currently, there are 4,470 there under the approved ceiling. The Pentagon is not precisely revealing what the troops might be called upon to do. Some number are expected to be military advisors and trainers for Iraqi and Kurdish forces, whiles others could be involved in logistics such as moving supplies and troops around the battlefield, the official said. Arizona Republican John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, criticized the move Thursday. ""Indeed, we read this morning of plans for yet another incremental increase of 500 troops in Iraq, one more step down the road of gradual escalation,"" he said."	9/23/16	link	mixture of true and

Updated 8:12 AM ET, Tue September 27, 2016  Story highlights Amy Walter said undecided voters are not a fan of either major candidate for president The Cook Political Report national editor also describes the dramatic shift among demographics Party People is a new podcast from CNN where a pair of conservative CNN contributors talk to influential voices about the future of conservatism and the Republican party.  (CNN)Cook Political Report national editor Amy Walter said undecided voters are different this election cycle because they're ""absolutely clued in"" with who the candidates of both major parties are -- and they still don't like what they see.  ""Normally what you see in those groups, people who are undecided, they're undecided because they really haven't been paid much attention,"" Walter told CNN's Party People podcast hosts Kevin Madden and Mary Katherine Ham in a recent conversation.  Walter, who also worked for former Democratic Rep. Marjorie Margolies Mezvinsky, said undecided voters sounded like children trying to avoid hopping into a cold pool. GOP policy guru: Trump can't 'fake his way through 90 minutes' ""Here, these undecided voters are absolutely clued-in and they're like that feeling we all had in school when you had to jump into the cold pool in first hour P.E., and you're like, 'I don't want to get in there, I don't want to jump in there! I know I'm going to have to get in.' So, they are undecided because they don't want to make a choice, not because they don't know about their choices,"" she said. Walter said for the first time that she can remember, she's having trouble trusting the data that's coming from the campaign trail, and that undecided voters are struggling to choose between the lesser of two evils. Voters say this is the ultimate 'lesser of two evils' election ""What I hear from these groups, is just this idea of like 'You know, I don't know if I trust Hillary Clinton,'"" she said. ""One woman said, 'I don't trust Hillary Clinton on terrorism' -- to sort of get to your point of instability in the world -- 'but Donald Trump is going to get us into World War III.' So, that's why people are like 'I'd rather cut my arm off than have this election, because that's what you're making me choose from.'"" Walter, who also previously worked for CNN, described how the political polarization between different demographic groups, in particular white voters and whether they have a college degree, can't be blamed entirely on Donald Trump. ""It has been a dramatic shift,"" Walter said. ""You can't blame that all on one candidate who had a great rally. This has been a steady movement that way."" To hear how Walter got her start in politics and more, listen to CNN's ""Party People,"" a new podcast where a pair of conservative CNN contributors talk to influential voices about the future of conservative politics and the Republican party."	9/27/16	link	no factual content		10	78	1412.19E+14	1.29E+15	mainstream	CNN Politics	https://www.facebook.com/cnnpolitics/posts/1291342320907598	"As Trump and Clinton debate foreign policy, Syria barely gets a mention  By Clarissa Ward, CNN Updated 11:46 AM ET, Tue September 27, 2016 The first presidential debate in under 2 minutes Now Playing The first presidential... kelly conway new day CNN anchor, Conway spar over refusing election results ana navarro  Ana Navarro mocks Trump's use of Spanish in debate tim kaine new day Kaine: I'm confident the people will accept the results  Clinton: I can't deal with all Trump's conspiracies (L-R) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton shake hands prior to the start of the Presidential Debate at Hofstra University on September 26, 2016 in Hempstead, New York.

(Mark Ralston/Pool via AP) A nasty final presidential debate in 90 seconds voter fraud panel 1  Watch tense CNN panel exchange over voter fraud claims kelly conway new day CNN anchor, Conway spar over refusing election results (CNN)The circus of politics can often be a distraction from actual policy -- and last night's debate proved no exception when it came to the subject of foreign affairs.  The back and forth between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was perhaps more instructive in terms of what was not mentioned -- Syria's civil war, for instance -- than what was discussed. To be fair, the debate was not intended to focus on international issues, which were basically a footnote in the ""securing America"" segment. But amid the exchanges about ISIS, Iran, NATO and nuclear proliferation, there were some brief glimpses of what the world might look like under a President Trump or a President Clinton. QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump? Fighting ISIS  For the most part, Trump focused on attacking Clinton's record -- ""she's got experience, but it's bad experience"" -- rather than on articulating his own foreign policy proposals. That was certainly true of the discussion on ISIS, which was mentioned 24 times during the foreign policy part of the debate. Clinton spoke of the need to ""intensify our air strikes against ISIS,"" ""support our Arab and Kurdish partners,"" and ""take out their leadership"" -- positions that don't differ much from President Barack Obama's current policies. MORE: CNN's Reality Check Team vets the claims  Trump repeatedly slammed Clinton and Obama for contributing to the rise of the terror group by pulling out of Iraq, but he offered no details of his own ""secret"" plan ""to knock the hell out of ISIS."" When Clinton taunted him about not having a plan, he retorted: ""You're telling the enemy everything you want to do ... No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life."" (Fact check: ISIS only came into being in 2006 after splintering from al Qaeda in Iraq. Clinton was born in 1947.) Iran's nuclear deal  Iran: The biggest issue for the next US president? 00:47 Similarly, on Iran, Trump repeatedly attacked Clinton for striking ""one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history,"" arguing that Iran had been ""about to fall"" and was now poised to become a ""major power."" But he didn't offer many suggestions for how it should have been done differently, beyond suggesting that ""they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places."" MORE: 6 key takeaways from the first debate Support for NATO  If the debate didn't offer much new insight into Trump's foreign policy plans, his comments about America's allies and NATO certainly did. ""I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world ... where they're not paying us what we need,"" Trump said. MORE: Trump, Clinton debate nukes, ISIS, hackers  Fact check: Was Russia behind the DNC cyberattacks? 01:27 It was a moment that will have sent shudders down the spines of America's international allies -- an isolationist vision that has many global leaders wary about a President Trump. Already under Obama, there is a perception that the US has retreated from taking an international leadership role, particularly in the Middle East. Clinton sought to provide some reassurance that she would be different, saying: ""we've got to work more closely with our allies"". But it remains to be seen how she would take on some of the toughest foreign policy questions -- namely, the civil war in Syria -- in a way that would be meaningfully different or more impactful than her predecessor. Perhaps the next debate will offer some more clues."	9/27/16	link	no factual content	yes	21	116	1492.19E+14	1.29E+15	mainstream	CNN Politics	https://www.facebook.com/cnnpolitics/posts/1291375430904287		9/27/16	link	mostly true		4	49	482.19E+14	1.29E+15	mainstream	CNN Politics	https://www.facebook.com/cnnpolitics/posts/1291404070901423		9/27/16	link	mostly true	yes	17	149	2202.19E+14	1.29E+15	mainstream	CNN Politics	https://www.facebook.com/cnnpolitics/posts/1291428494232314		9/27/16	link	mostly true		8	95	472.19E+14	1.29E+15	mainstream	CNN Politics	https://www.facebook.com/cnnpolitics/posts/1291455630896267	"How Hillary Clinton found her stride on gender Maeve Reston By Maeve Reston, CNN Updated 6:42 PM ET, Tue September 27, 2016 (L-R) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton shake hands prior to the start of the Presidential Debate at Hofstra University on September 26, 2016 in Hempstead, New York.

Demonstrate power, command of the issues and the ability to shred your opponent -- all while seeming (just) likeable enough. Monday night's faceoff with Donald Trump could have been heralded as another historic first for women. But Clinton made no mention of a glass ceiling. There was no self-congratulatory nod to the fact that she was the first female nominee of a major party to take that stage before as many as 100 million people. She wore red, a power color, but with a feminine cut that looked anything but severe. She was smooth and measured; flicking subtly to her gender with a quick mention of granddaughter Charlotte right off the top, but then didn't dwell on it.   She didn't lecture. She smiled (a lot) Ñ even as he slid into his role of interrupter-in-chief. Before Monday night's debate, all the attention was on which Donald Trump would appear -- the restrained candidate or the flame-thrower of primary days. But it was the former secretary of state who pulled off the more fascinating performance -- taking command of the stage, dominating Trump on a wide array of issues, luring him into ill-advised digressions about the source of his wealth and whether he pays federal taxes. Trump complains about debate mic In an interesting strategic move, she waited until the very end of the debate to throw her sharpest dart by raising his past descriptions of women ""as pigs, slobs and dogs"" and his criticism of weight gain by 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Trump shook his head, demanding where she had gotten her information (it's on tape); but then didn't seem to have an effective response. Instead he wandered off into a digression about Rosie O'Donnell, the meanness of Clinton's ads, and the notion that he had planned to mention Bill Clinton's infidelities -- but was holding back the instinct to say ""something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family."" ""I said to myself, 'I can't do it. I just can't do it,' Trump said. And then the debate was over. One critical task for Clinton in the coming weeks is activating and energizing female voters, particularly moderate Republican and undecided women turned off by Trump. Her team clearly felt her light touch gender strategy -- provoking Trump but not complaining about her treatment -- worked Monday night. Her campaign chairman John Podesta told reporters before leaving New York that Trump's ""constant interruption of her probably was reminiscent of the way a lot of women feel about bullies in their lives. He added, ""I thought it was kind of unbecoming and he couldn't stop himself."" The campaign followed up with a gut-punching web video showing Trump's comments on Machado's weight and the nickname she said he adopted for the Latina contest winner: ""Miss Housekeeping."" Who is Alicia Machado?   Follow  Hillary Clinton _ @HillaryClinton Trump on Alicia, 1996: ""Miss Piggy.""  This morning: ""She gained a massive amount of weight...it was a real problem."" 6:57 AM - 27 Sep 2016   23,125 23,125 Retweets   33,243 33,243 likes In a gaggle with reporters en route to North Carolina, Clinton brushed off Trump's interruptions, taking a page from Carly Fiorina's playbook when Trump made comments during the GOP primary about her face. ""I think his demeanor, his temperament, his behavior on the stage could be seen by everybody,"" Clinton told reporters who had asked about his frequent interruptions. The strategy? Let women judge for themselves. Was she fearful of future mentions of Bill Clinton's infidelity? ""He can run his campaign however he chooses, and, you know, I will continue to talk about what I want to do for the American people,"" she replied. As the race has tightened in recent weeks, Trump's aides believe it is in part because they are making gains among suburban women, particularly in states like Colorado and Pennsylvania, who like Trump's childcare plan and his recent policy speeches. How Trump's performance affects that calculus remains to be seen. But he seemed to have walked into Clinton's trap on Fox & Friends Tuesday morning when he defended his comments about Machado's weight. Obama on debate: Trump lacks necessary &#39;preparation,&#39; &#39;temperament&#39; Obama on debate: Trump lacks necessary 'preparation,' 'temperament' ""I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst,"" Trump said, later adding, ""She was the winner and you know, she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem.""

Lets look at Trumps objectionable temperament and then see what it has to do with being president. Mark Mellman made these observations ÒÉa crucial contrast on character is frankly much more powerful than when you make a contrast on policy.Ó This is why we are looking at character in the first place, so we do not look at failed policies. Dr. Frank said, ÒMost of my colleagues feel that heÕs not crazy, and if he is crazy, heÕs crazy like a fox,Ó.  Dan P. Adams,who analyzes character traits concluded not surprisingly, that Donald Trump has Òsky-high extroversion combined with off-the-chart low agreeableness (the extent to which a person appears to be caring, loving, affectionate, polite, and kind). Anger may be the operative emotion behind TrumpÕs high extroversion as well as his low agreeableness. Anger can fuel malice, but it can also motivate social dominance, stoking a desire to win the adoration of others. Trump may be a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker, more like Bill Clinton than Bush. Decision makers who, like Nixon, who are dispositionally low on agreeableness might hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries.Ó  Many other presidents ranked high in these traits. Among them was Lyndon Johnson who scored the highest, followed closely by Teddy Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton. TrumpÕs personality type is classified as a Promoter. Other non-presidents who fit this category are Ernest Hemingway, Eva Peron, Winston Churchill, Grace Slick, Madonna, George S. Patton, and Steve Jobs. ÒThey are Bold and daring at heart, and ever-optimistic that things will go their way. Promoters will take tremendous risks to get what they want, and seem exhilarated by walking close to the edge of disaster. Because of this, they make the very best trouble-spot administrators and negotiators, and they can be outstanding entrepreneurs, able to swing deals and kick-start enterprises in a way no other type can.Ó says Dan Adams,  Take Andrew Jackson for example. His campaign centered on JacksonÕs image as a man of the people battling aristocracy and corruption. Strong-willed and sharp-tempered, a fierce patriot and rabid partisan, Jackson was always controversial. He personalized disputes and demonized opponents. Yet behind JacksonÕs towering rages often lay shrewd calculation of their political effects. JacksonÕs quick temper was notorious. His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him. Jackson was often in control of his rage, and used it (and his fearsome reputation) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs. His opponents were terrified of his temper: Observers likened him to a volcano, and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt. He believed that the president is not just an executive but also a representative of all the people. He entered office determined to end government corruption and the nationÕs financial difficulties caused, he thought, by the upper-class elite in government, business, and finance.(Taken from a variety of historical sources).  Rather than disqualifying Donald Trump, his temperament may make him the most qualified. Like Andrew Jackson, we may not like him, but if we are looking for a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker,who may hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries, someone who is bold and daring at heart, and ever-optimistic that things will go the right way for the American people, able to take tremendous risks to get what he wants, the very best trouble-spot administrator and negotiator, able to swing deals and kick-start the economy in a way no other can, then we might have to overlook the baggage that comes with Donald Trump.

BURKE SEPTEMBER 18, 2016 1.4K SHARES ShareTweetPlus Donald Trump has just received what has to be his most positive poll of the general election season, showing the Republican nominee opening up a large lead over Hillary Clinton, while support among black voters is soaring to levels Democrats had not thought possible.  The new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times ÒDaybreakÓ poll released on Sunday shows Trump with a commanding 6.7 percent lead over Clinton, 47.7 percent to 41.0 percent, an indication that HillaryÕs collapsing after being forced to leave a 9/11 memorial early is taking its toll, along with the every changing explanations for the health scare from her campaign, which ranged from ÒoverheatedÓ to the flu, to pneumonia.  More impressive and yet worrisome for Democrats, and the reason the party, all Democrat Media Complex, and Hillary Clinton herself has been going full-force with the Òbirther equals racistÓ narrative, is TrumpÕs massive gains among black voters in the past week.  Trump now has over 20 percent support among black voters, up from only 3 percent just a week ago. Hillary Clinton has 70 percent, significantly lower than the number typically enjoyed by Democrat nominees.  Notable is that voters under the age of 35 previously were favored by sizable margins by Clinton, but now the bloviating billionaire and reality TV actor has an 8-point advantage. And among those with a high school education or less, TrumpÕs support has surged to a 21-point advantage, up from single digits only weeks ago.  The LA Times poll has before been favorable to Trump previously, showing the race tighter than most when Clinton was leading significantly. However, this poll, with TrumpÕs sizable lead and improving performance among black voters, has got to cause panic among Democrats and the Clinton campaign.  I thought several times last week that Democrats must be really worried about Trump going after black voters with the focus suddenly being on birtherism Ñ an issue that hadnÕt been talked about for several months that the media just recently brought back into the conversation. ItÕs likely that ClintonÕs internal polling was also showing TrumpÕs surge among black voters even before the LA Times poll.

This latest incident took place on the campus at the University of Houston when grad student Ford a ÔBlack Lives MatterÓ member and group leader was robbed at gun point, as he was about to enter his apartment.  He describes walking by a young man apparently loitering next to his apartment complex, and thought nothing of it until he unlocked his door, and then the young thug sprung into action, pulling out a hand gun and demanding FordÕs wallet and cell phone, which of course Ford surrendered.  Ironically Ford is running for Texas State Representative, while also a vocal activist and head of Houston Chapter of ÒBlack Lives MatterÓ, which of course promotes the de-funding of many police programs around the country.  And which of course made his comments after being robbed all the more ludicrous stating: ÒI hope they (the police), would take a bigger stance and put more security over here because you have a lot of people walking back and forth to class.Ó  Ford also added that because the housing is off campus, it isnÕt patrolled by university police security, which he would like to see it changed for the protection of the studentsÉit would seem that a conservative by any other name, is a liberal once mugged.  Then after this BLM ""activist"" actually had the nerve to actually ask for more protection from the police he comically had this to say about the thief, ""I would've gave him money,"" he said. ""I would've talked to him because the real crime is why is he in that position that he feels the need to come and hang out at a college campus and rob people of stuff they worked for.""  Right.

Hillary warmly greeted the young woman, but her smile quickly faded when the woman brought up ClintonÕs Òsuper predatorÓ remark as young black protesters have in the recent past.  The former First Lady pointed out that during the early stages of her campaign, she professed to believing that racial profiling is wrong. The Minnesota voter remained both unimpressed and undeterred in her quest to find out if the black community could count on Hillary Clinton to not flip-flop her belief system again if elected. Hillary was quick to say it is not true that she isnÕt a friend to black Americans, and she directed the young woman to take a look at her history as a proffer of her commitment.

ÒIt was wrong. We heard from all the people around her that it was wrong, she shouldnÕt have done it, it was poorly thought out. It wasnÕt enough.

At least 15 of the Clinton FoundationÕs corporate donors Ñ representing $47 million in contributions Ñ were able to win invitations to two or more official state dinners.  Significantly, the decision makers who authorized the special invitations were not at the White House at all, but were ensconced in the Department StateÕs Office of Protocol. The protocol office, chosen by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are filled solely with long-time Clinton loyalists.  Despite the Democratic presidential nomineeÕs departure from the Department of State in 2013, all of the top officeholders in the protocol office throughout ObamaÕs two terms have been senior staffers who served in either former President Bill ClintonÕs White House or in HillaryÕs Senate and 2008 presidential campaigns.  Critics of the foundation worry Dennis Cheng Ñ who served as ClintonÕs protocol deputy chief and later went directly to the Clinton Foundation as its chief fundraiser Ñ could have Òwalked awayÓ with valuable donor lists compiled by the office.  After Cheng left the Department of State, he raised a record quarter billion dollars while at the foundation. He is now HillaryÕs national fundraiser, leading her presidential bid to raise $2 billion. As a result, The Daily Beast once called him, ÒHillary ClintonÕs $2 billion money man.Ó  If Cheng shared confidential information with the foundation, he may have violated a special ÒMemorandum of UnderstandingÓ (MOU) signed by the foundation and the Obama transition team in November 2008. The MOU warned of avoiding Òpotential or actual conflict of interest.Ó  Cheng also could run afoul of a 18 USC 208, a federal statute that Òprohibits an executive branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a particular Government matter that will affect his own financial interests,Ó including those of a prospective employer or a family member.  ÒHow much of the mailing list and contact information Cheng got at Protocol, migrated over to the Clinton Foundation,Ó asked Charles Ortel a Wall Street investor and an outspoken critic of the Clinton Foundation.  ÒWe donÕt yet how much of this extraordinarily valuable contact information as it walked out the front door either in Dennis ChengÕs personal cell phone, or on a contact list that might have been emailed.Ó he said in an interview with TheDCNF.  Neither the foundation nor HillaryÕs presidential campaign responded to inquiries about potential conflicts of interest surrounding Cheng.  Bill boasted in a Tuesday CNN interview that foundation donors never benefited from any Department of State action, asserting, Òto the best of my knowledge, nobody ever got anything from the State Department because they supported the Clinton Foundation.Ó  Yet, official White House dinners are among the most glamorous and exclusive venues in Washington, D.C., and the competition to secure an invitation is fierce.  Guests not only can mingle with a head of state and their closest advisors, but they also offer privileged access to the president, top White House staff and many cabinet members.  Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova, who prosecuted corruption cases in Washington, D.C., told TheDCNF the White House dinners werenÕt only benefits, but amounted to the Òselling of access.Ó  ÒThe obvious connection between donations and access to big, White House state dinners is very important,Ó he said in an interview with TheDCNF.  ÒIt was clearly a reward to donors, something they got as a result of giving money to the Clinton Foundation,Ó he stated. DiGenova was U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and was appointed an Independent Counsel concerning the Clinton passport disclosure case.  ÒWe are looking into ChengÕs relationship between the State Department and the foundation and the political donor class,Ó former U.S. Attorney Matthew Whitaker told TheDCNF. Whitaker is the executive director of the ethics watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust (FACT).  ÒCheng is the person in the middle of this situation. He had substantial input as to who was invited, who got seated where,Ó he said.  ÒI would say ChengÕs a key figure Ñ really a shadowy figure Ñ in this whole thing,Ó Whitaker added.  ÒItÕs very obvious to me that people were giving to the foundation, not only because they perceived they could get access to the State Department, but it now appears they were giving in order to get access to State Dinners at the White House,Ó he told TheDCNF.  FACT has been trying to obtain the email traffic between Cheng and the Clinton Foundation under the Freedom of Information Act. The group initially filed an FOIA request in February 2015, but Department of State officials are refusing to release any of the emails before the presidential election.  ÒThey have been stonewalling us and not responsive and now theyÕre telling us that we probably wonÕt get it until mid-to-late November,Ó Whitaker said. He served as the US Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004-2009.  The protocol office has been stacked from the very beginning with Clinton veterans. When Cheng served as deputy chief of the protocol office, his boss was Chief Capricia Marshall who, at age 32, served as the White House social secretary for Hillary when Bill was president.  After Cheng left in 2011, his replacement was Natalie Jones, who was HillaryÕs Mid-Atlantic finance director for her 2008 presidential bid. Jones was joined by Mark Walsh, HillaryÕs LGBT Òoutreach directorÓ from her 2008 campaign.  Peter Selfridge succeeded Marshall in June 2014 as the chief of protocol and is the current head of the office. He served in the scheduling and advance office at former President Bill ClintonÕs White House.  One of the most revealing illustration of ChengÕs continuing contact with the the protocol office after he joined the Clinton Foundation is in email exchanges.  In a March 8, 2012 email from Marshall to Jones, Cheng and HillaryÕs deputy chief of staff, Huma Abedin, the chief happily identifies foundation donors who were to attend the March 14, 2012 state dinner for British Prime Minister David Cameron.  ÒInvited to state dinner,Ó Marshall informed the group.  Two of those invited included Clinton Democratic fundraiser Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who gave between $100,000 to $250,000, and Fred Eychaner, who committed $25 million to the foundation.  ÒNice,Ó replies Abedin.  Although the 2008 MOU explicitly sought to build a wall between the foundation and ClintonÕs official business, Cheng felt it was appropriate to later invite Abedin to a Clinton Foundation dinner that included foreign nationals.  In a June 11, 2012 email, he urges Abedin to come to Little Rock for the dinner. ÒAttached is list of attendees for tomorrow nightÕs Clinton Foundation dinner,Ó he wrote Abedin.  Among those attending was Recep Ozkan, a Turkish national who donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the Clinton Foundation.  Ozkan was the liaison for Fethullah Gulen, a secretive Turkish cleric who allegedly was behind the failed July 15 coup attempt against the Turkish government of President Recep Erdogan.  Erdogan filed papers with the U.S. government seeking the extradition of Gulen, according to Tuesday reports.  Also attending the dinner was Victor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian tycoon who married the daughter of Ukrainian strongman Leonid Kuchma, who was considered a corrupt leader during his years in office.  The email was obtained by Citizens United, a conservative group, under the Freedom of Information Act.  One of the most notorious Clinton Foundation donors to attend a White House dinner was Rajat Gupta, a long-time personal friend of BillÕs who was convicted of insider trading. He served two years in a federal penitentiary.  Gupta was the first foreign-born managing director at McKinsey & Company and reportedly hired Chelsea Clinton for her first job. Without any experience, he paid her a six figure salary. Gupta attended the dinner for the Indian Prime Minister in 2009.  Ortel claims the pattern of awarding government perks to donors began in the 1990s during BillÕs first term at the White House.  At the time, Clinton and his aides rented out the Lincoln Bedroom to 66 campaign contributors and offered seats on Air Force One to 56 contributors.  ÒTo see the pattern, you really have to go back to when they were in control of the White House, the first time and they clearly demonstrated the propensity to rent out the Lincoln bedroom, to sell seats on Air Force One,Ó Ortel told TheDCNF. ÒSo this was an old game.Ó  Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Republican congresswoman who is vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and leading a congressional investigation into the Clinton Foundation, told TheDCNF, ÒThis is further evidence of the ClintonÕs ÔPay to PlayÕ mentality. The State Dinners provide incredible opportunities to meet our governmentÕs highest ranking officials and Clinton Foundation donors were able to get special access simply because they stroked a check.Ó  ÒThe quid pro quo is astonishing and it begs the question of whether the Clintons are beneath selling anything,Ó Blackburn charged.  In addition to the donations paid outright to the Clinton Foundation, a number of corporate donors also paid Bill and Hillary high six-figure speaking fees. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman SachsÕ chairman and CEO, attended one of the hottest state dinners Ñ a January 19, 2011 White House State Dinner for former Chinese President Hu Jintao.  His company donated $1 to $5 million to the foundation, and its Goldman Philanthropy Fund gave an additional $250,000 to $500,000, according to the Clinton Foundation website.  But that wasnÕt the only contributions to Bill and Hillary. The company also gave the couple $2.25 million for 12 speeches before Goldman Sachs venues.  Brian Moynihan, Bank of AmericaÕs CEO and chairman, attended the May 19, 2010 state dinner toasting Felipe Calderon, MexicoÕs former president.  The Bank of America Foundation donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the Clinton Foundation, and the Bank of America Corporation contributed between $100,000 to $250,000.  But Bank of America also paid more than $1 million for four speeches to both Bill and Hillary.  The Clinton Foundation donors invited to more than one state dinner were: Honeywell, GE, Dreamworks, PepsiCo, Morgan Stanley, Coca Cola, Dow, Boeing, Intel, UPS, Comcast, IBM and the Blackstone Group. Microsoft and the Ford Foundation were invited to three state dinners.  J.T. Mastranadi, political director of the Citizens United, said his organizationÕs conclusion was, Òregardless of where you happened to be employed at any given time Ð the Clinton State Department or the Clinton Foundation Ð the top priority was always donor maintenance.Ó  TheDCNF contacted the Clinton Foundation and HillaryÕs presidential campaign about a wide range of questions regarding the state dinners and the foundation. Neither responded.  To see the full list of Clinton Foundation Donor attendees to all 12 White House State Dinners, click here.

SEPTEMBER 18, 2016 ShareTweetPlusPin The debate rules commission seems to be putting their money where their mouth is, alright. Not every commissioner has contributed but Donald Trump has a net $0.00 donation record. This is the group that will set the rules for the Presidential debates. Hopefully, The Donald will have some input on this, but do not expect fair and equal treatment for him.  As Written By Brendan Derby for Lifezette:   Campaign contributions from ÔbipartisanÕ debate commissioners given exclusively to Clinton.  The men and women who run the supposedly ÒnonpartisanÓ Commission on Presidential Debates have put their money where their mouths are Ñ and it all has gone to Democrat Hillary Clinton.  The amount of money is small by the standards of a modern presidential campaign, but it is one-sided. A pair of Ph.D. candidates at Stanford University examined campaign finance reports and found that all of the $5,650 in contributions that commission members have made to presidential candidates during this election season have gone to Clinton.  Republican Donald Trump, who will meet Clinton in the first debate a week from Monday, received no donations from debate commission members. Green Party nominee Jill Stein and Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, who both learned Friday that they will be shut out of the first debate, also received nothing.  Kevin Zeese, an adviser to the Stein campaign, told LifeZette the contributions are further evidence of a bipartisan conspiracy to rig the electoral system against third-party alternatives. And the fact that Clinton scooped up all of the contributions made by commission members this year fits with the fact that she has won support not only from her own party but many Establishment figures in the Republican Party, as well.  ÒHillary Clinton has done a really good job of uniting the two parties,Ó he said. ÒItÕs almost like É.

Scene number four Ð a couple of weeks since my arrival:  IÕm having an awful nightmare. IÕm walking out of the classroom to find all of the faculty, the staff, and the students standing in a line. At the front of the line, there is a small TV in the SecretaryÕs office. A major terrorist attack has occurred. I wish itÕs not true, and that itÕs just a bad dream. I am hoping to wake up. However, It was true, I was awake, it was really happening.  Scene number five Ð I take my spot in the line waiting and my heart is racing:  What if they were Muslims? Please God, donÕt let them be Muslims. The news came, the truth was hard. They were Muslims and worse, the leader is Egyptian.  I am speechless.

Kennedy, a Democrat, ended his memorable and stirring inaugural address with the words Òasking for GodÕs help, here on Earth, GodÕs work, must truly be our own.Ó Despite his obvious moral failings in his private life, President KennedyÕs personal ambitions were transcended by his belief that his primary duty in public life was to love his country and to serve her people. That said, we also know he was a Democrat, and the last Democrat to serve as President, whose efforts as Chief Executive were meant to build up America, rather than to tear America apart.  Following the tragic assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, up to and including the present, there have been four more Presidents from the Democratic Party: Lyndon Johnson, (1963-69); Jimmie Carter (1977-81); Bill Clinton (1993-2001); and Barack Obama, (2009-?). Under their individual and collective brand of so-called leadership, the United States of America and her people have been steadily and systematically dismantled, fragmented, weakened, and mercilessly abused. During these past 50 years, thanks to the national Democrats and the left-wing allies in Congress, the White House and our Federal Court System, the national Democratic Party has become AmericaÕs largest and most powerful Òhate group.Ó  Lyndon Johnson, also known as ÒLBJÓ took America into the malicious morass of the Vietnam war, and into the abyss of the equally malicious lie known as the ÒGreat Society,Ó spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a vast system of socialist welfare spending that perpetuated poverty, especially in our cities and our minority communities, in a deliberate move to weaken the poor and less advantaged into federal dependency. At the same time, we fought an undeclared war in Vietnam and Southeast Asia for a decade, resulting in more than 58,000 needless deaths in the U.S. Military, only to lose the war and witness the humiliation of reunification of North and South Vietnam into one Communist nation. LBJ partnered with another, degenerate member of the Kennedy clan, Ted Kennedy, to engineer passage in 1965 of new immigration laws that started the stampede of mass legal and illegal immigration that eventually evolved into the Òopen bordersÓ mess that brings in terrorists, America-haters and uneducated millions who promptly entered the social welfare system immediately upon arrival.  James Earl ÒJimmieÓ Carter, sat fecklessly in a cardigan sweater by the fireplace one January evening and told Americans that we were in a Òmalaise,Ó or more directly expressed, Americans were in a foul mood, anxious and frustrated by both an economy in shambles with high unemployment and high inflation, as well as a foreign policy that created the conditions to begin the awakening of long simmering but dormant radical Islam, with the takeover of the American Embassy and the ÒtriumphantÓ return from French exile of the Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran and leadership in 1979. Carter sat in a cardigan sweater and blamed Americans for a mood of ÒmalaiseÓ that Carter created.  Jimmie CarterÕs primary accomplishment in four years as President was the humiliation of America before the rest of the world, as well as his own place in history as having been humiliated personally in the eyes of the majority of Americans.  William Jefferson ÒBillÓ Clinton began his Presidency on January 20, 1993 with his ÒgratuitousÓ attendance at the ÒGay and Lesbian Inaugural BallÓ in Washington, beginning on day one of his Presidency to repay the support in his election campaign of the LBGT Lobby. Soon after, Clinton announced the rueful break with two centuries of military tradition and law by instituting the infamous ÒDonÕt Ask, DonÕt TellÓ policy permitting Gays to serve without fear of discharge. He put ÒHillary the HorribleÓ Clinton in charge of an ill-fated attempt to ram socialized medicine down the throats of the American people, and Bill Clinton, with the successful enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement or ÒNAFTAÓ, accelerated to Òwarp speedÓ the exodus of  American businesses, jobs, and wealth to foreign nations such as Mexico, that had begun in the 1970s. Later in his Presidency his womanizing caught up with him and, after having one or more sexual affairs in the White House, was impeached by Congress, not for womanizing but for proceeding to lie to Congress and lie to the entire nation by denying the sexual immoralities.  Three previous Democratic Presidents had succeeded in seriously damaging and weakening America, by the time the notorious Barack Hussein Obama was elected and sworn in as the 44th President on January 20, 2009. His eight years in office have included the most reckless borrowing and spending of any administration in history. Half our entire national debt ($10 Billion of the $20 Billion) was created in just the past eight years of ObamaÕs tenure. Yet Mr. Obama has absolutely nothing to show for all that reckless spending. The economy is in shambles, the infrastructure of highways, bridges, and public lands is crumbling, while the military forces and weaponry that must defend our nation is being systematically dismantled. Meanwhile tens of millions of Americans have been added to the already overwhelming financial burden in government through swollen welfare rolls, food stamps, forced early retirements, long term unemployment, and social security disability fraud. Mr. Obama, whose sworn duty along with Congress under the Constitution is to Òpromote the General Welfare, has instead promote the welfare of every small minority and special interest groups imaginable, in response to their collective loud potty mouths, collective asinine demands, and their collective calls for elevation to privileged and special legal status of their immoral and degenerate agendas. Mr. Obama has used the Òbully pulpitÓ leadership tradition begun by Teddy Roosevelt, not to uplift, inspire and unify, but instead to berate, lecture and divide Americans. To Barack Obama, Ò(radical) black lives matterÓ; Ògay and lesbian lives matterÓ; Òradical Muslim lives matterÓ; Òillegal alien lives matterÓ; convicted criminals lives matterÓ; meanwhile, the lives of ordinary, law-abiding, responsible working Americans, do not matter; the lives of Christians, foreign and domestic, do not matter; the lives of American military servicemen and women do not matter; the lives of our veterans do not matter; the lives of the Òthin blue lineÓ of peace officers in our police and sheriff departments do not matter; and, with all certainty, the protections due to Americans under our Constitution and the Bill of Rights, in the mind of Mr. Obama, do not matter at all.  In the half century since the assassination of John F. Kennedy, under the Presidency of the four Democratic Presidents that followed, as well as the years of Democratic control of Congress, and Federal Courts, the national Democratic Party has deliberately and with malice aforethought trampled on the general welfare of the decent, hardworking and law abiding majority in America, while trampling on our rights and wastefully expending our tax dollars, to pay false homage to dozens of undeserving but vocal and demanding minority special interest groups, to the severe detriment of the much earned and deserving general welfare of the vast majority of our nationÕs citizens.  The national Democratic Party has become nothing short of AmericaÕs most powerful Òhate group.Ó  The American left wing, socialists and Democrats are the party that despises, attacks and works diligently and unceasingly to destroy all that is good within America. This Òhate groupÓ called the national Democratic Party demonizes: (1) law abiding morally upright American citizens; (2) unborn children; Christians; (3) Constitutional Conservatives; (4) legal gun owners; (5) job-producing energy businesses in oil, gas and coal production; (6) rural and small town America; (7) the ranching and farming West, including the Òhorse culture Ò of wild mustangs and ranchers; (8) small business owners; (9) our police and our military, including veterans; and (10) above all, the Democratic party despises God, the Bible, Christianity and the ethical moral codes and common law inherent to Judeo-Christian foundations cited by the Founding Fathers 240 years ago.  Although the Judeo-Christian, moral and ethical, Constitutional Conservative American majority is clearly despised by the Òhate groupÓ called the Democratic Party, we the American majority do not hate, because Jesus Christ taught us that the greatest commandment of all is to love one another, and not to hate the sinner, but to instead only hate the sin. The vast majority of Americans should, and indeed do, hate sin. However, the Democratic Party clearly despises us. To paraphrase John F. KennedyÕs words from 1961; Americans who are Constitutional Conservatives, Christians and law abiding, ethical citizens must Òhelp every friend, and oppose any foe.Ó We must love and support each other, but at the same time, we must band together and fight the Left Wing. We must fight the evil of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. We must fight the immorality of communism, fascism, radical LBGT groups, radical Islam, collectivist Socialism, radical Atheism, and every foe of our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Ronald ReaganÕs ÒShining City on the Hill.Ó A famous aphorism states, ÒAll that is required for evil to prevail is for good men and women to do nothing.Ó Above all, therefore, righteous, conservative and patriotic Americans must fight evil, so that the good may once again prevail in America in the historically prevailing form of ÒLiberty, Justice and Virtue.Ó  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com"	9/20/16	link	no factual content		1474	1176	401.36E+14	5.52E+14	right	Eagle Rising	https://www.facebook.com/theEagleisRising/posts/551827871687392	"Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police 7 months ago  Written by eaglerising 28 SHARES ShareTweetPinEmail From the Daily Caller News Foundation:  The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.  Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to Òselective enforcementÓ based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.  Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with ÒbaselessÓ tickets, and that locals said: ÒMuslims donÕt belong here.Ó Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

Ever since government education has become the norm, kids are dumb and dumber. But big government advocates claim that the problem is that they just donÕt have enough money. So, they throw more money at it, and the problems only get bigger. Ever since the War on Drugs was declared, weÕve spent over $1.5 trillion, and drug use remains unchanged or even worse. But instead of questioning the policy or considering the Constitutionality of the issue, their answer is to throw more money at it, in hopes that theyÕll finally stamp out illegal drug usage once and for all. But it only gets worse.  The same is true with the ÒWar on Terror.Ó The U.S. government dumped $5 trillion into it, terrorism has increased by leaps and bounds. But instead of reevaluating our foreign policy Ð especially pertaining to the Middle East Ð the politiciansÕ answer is to expand our foreign policy, and of course, throw more money at it. And terrorism continues to grow. From Zero Hedge:  According to a report released by Dr. Neta Crawford, professor of political science at Brown University, spending by the United States Departments of Defense, State, Homeland Security, and Veteran Affairs since 9/11 is now close to $5 trillion USD. Before we have the chance to ask how a country that has racked up over $19.3 trillion USD in debt can spend $5 trillion USD on war, the focus of this article is to ask: What has all of this spending achieved?  As Reader Supported News reported at the end of last year, terrorism has increased 6,500 percent since 2002 (they probably should rename it Òthe war of terrorÓ). In 2014, the outlet noted, it was reported that 74 percent of all terror-related casualties occurred in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Syria. As stated by Paul Gottinger, a staff reporter for Reader Supported News, out of the aforementioned countries, Òonly Nigeria did not experience either U.S. air strikes or a military occupation in that year.Ó  Omitted from that assessment is the fact that the U.S. has been meddling in Nigeria for some time now. Why wouldnÕt they? Until recently, Nigeria was AfricaÕs largest oil producer, as well as the continentÕs largest economy until last month.  And look at this shocker from Ben Swann:  ÒBefore the 2003 U.S. invasion, do you know how many suicide attacks there were in Iraq? None. In the countryÕs history there had never been one. But since the 2003 invasion, there have been 1,892.  ÒIn Iraq, prior to the start of the Iraq war, there were reportedly just over 1.5 million Christians living in that country. And yet shortly after the war started, more than one million of them fled to Syria. That didnÕt work out well. Today fewer than half a million Christians remain and yet are being exterminated by groups like ISIS.Ó  The more terrorism grows and is a threat to our national security, the more laws the U.S. government passes that not only continually erode away at our freedoms, but do nothing to protect us.

I donÕt think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that theyÕre an organization for good.  The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:  Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton FoundationÕs massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organizationÕs IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and Òother expenses.Ó  The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organizationÕs IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants.  That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits.  Another $50.4 million was marked as Òother expenses,Ó while the remaining almost $851K was marked as Òprofessional fundraising expenses.Ó  Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more Òother expensesÓ in 2014.  Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

With this premium on truth you would think any government operation would necessarily be truth driven.  After witnessing the idiotic promises from candidates for public office you may begin to suspect that the honoring of truth is only for those who are not in government or who get caught.  The problem is the issue is far more grave than most people suspect even in their most dubious moods.  The issue I am talking about is in the field of government accounting.  Now we all know about the $600 hammers and the waste in superfluous studies that find the obvious and spend billions to do it.  But this accounting is small potatoes beside the larger issue of how the government manipulates the core index when trying to downplay the real rate of inflation.  Now just a word about the insidiousness of inflation and the consequences of allowing it to creep into full blown hyper-inflation.  Countries have turned from peace to war, democracies to dictatorships, semi-free to Fascist and completely collapsed because they were unable or unwilling to control inflation.  Check out the demise of major powers past and present and you will find an unsound currency is the one common factor that contributed to the collapse/demise.  And the soundness of the currency was always based on the government creating currency in volumes that had no backing except the promise to pay from further borrowing, taxation and currency expansion ( i.e the printing of paper money ).  With so much at stake you would think the government would want to know exactly what is the rate of inflation and how can it be kept under control.  After all how could anyone be so suicidal to hide the figures that would need to be reviewed and acted upon to perpetuate a countryÕs government?  As I spoke of in an earlier article, politicians are sacrificial both in what they seek and what they ask of their constituents.  This sacrificial banner becomes a shroud for themselves when the seek to deceive and ignore what they think they are getting away with because no one is naming the issue.  This is why they have earned so much distrust and disapproval.  Fro a complete understanding of the hideousness of the governmentÕs attempt to distort and hide true inflation rates I refer you to an article written by Jim Puplava at http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/2005/0624.html .  What motivates the people on a committee to deliberately distort the way the government determines inflation rates so that the government can continue its deficit spending and ultimately bankrupting  the country?  It is the same motivation of the unrepentant cookie stealer.  They think they can get away with it.  And they can and they will if no one calls them to task and points out the dishonesty they are promoting.  In todayÕs world of politics it would require a ground swell of voters making enough noise and demanding accurate honest figures but most voters are ignorant of the practices and gullible regarding the truly evil motives at work in the bowels of the very organization that is charged with protecting the country.  The irony is the stupidity of those who think they are pulling the wool over the eyes of the populace. What they are hiding are the very facts and figures that will protect not only the country but their livelihood and their ultimate survival.  This is beyond stupid and certainly falls well within the category of criminality.  This in an organization that is charged with protecting the citizenry from criminals.  But what security is there in the fox guarding the hen house?  This issue is not covered on the financial channels on TV to any extent.  It is ignored by the press and all the talk radio pundits rarely question what is obvious to everyday Americans watching prices go through the roof.  When the issue is brought up, Americans are prone to trust the government to give accurate figures and believe the inflation rate, no matter how it is computed , is real and there is no need for concern.  As Ronald Reagan said, Ò Trust but verifyÓ.  There is no verification to be found that the figures being spouted are true.  The real figures are much higher and this means the government has less financial problems to worry about as long as they can push this scam down the populaceÕs throat.  The adjustments to Social Security are lower because of these bogus figures, the government debt is viewed as lower because of these figures, the weak dollar is the result of the real figures the government doesnÕt want to face up to  and the cheap appearance of the coinage reflects the same phenomena.  Now that the American public is getting excited about a presidential race it is time to ask these pretentious candidates what they know about the Òcore indexÓ that reflects the rate of inflation and what are they going to do to get the government to recognize it is deceiving the American public with its bogus rate of inflation to the detriment of the entire country.  There is not one candidate that has brought the issue up and there is not one who will have a satisfactory answer to why they havenÕt.  If you believe the press has commentators that can ask hard questions you need to take a hard look at this very pressing issue and ask yourself why this has not even been raised.  The emperor of inflation is parading around naked as a jay bird and no one in the reporting business has even spotted him.  Not only is the government deceiving and manipulating the American public but the free press charged with finding the truth and reporting on it ,is ignoring the very essence of our survival as a nation.  There has been a concern with human cloning expressed by the U.N. and others, but the cloning from our universities has already occurred.  The clones are the genetic/intellectual equivalent of their instructors who dream of a fantasy modeled by PlatoÕs Utopia and care not one whit about the truth nor the means of attainment. As with the Soviet experiment, what they seek is oblivion. Faking reality doesnÕt change reality , it only destroys the dishonest.  Facing reality requires a hard cold look not a placating syrupy soothing assurance that all is well and will turn out for the best if weÕll just be faithful , trusting and above all quiet.  The terrorists on 9/11 offered such assurances to the trusting passengers as they flew into oblivion.  We are passengers in the same predicament and like the passengers in Pennsylvania we need to ÒRollÓ or perish for the ideals of the misguided, misinformed, dishonest pretending to work for the public good.

West:  There are times when I just have to share the Sunday message I receive, and this is one of those times.  Often when IÕm out and about with Christians, I get the Òwhat can we do, it all seems so hopelessÓ line. And folks I gotta tell ya, noting upsets me more than to hear Christians talk about a situation being termed as hopeless.  Many believe thereÕs nothing that can be done against the progressive socialist and secular humanist leftÕs assault on religious freedoms and liberty. Case in point: look whatÕs happening in North Carolina because they have a law stating that youÕll use the bathrooms and facilities corresponding to the gender on your birth certificate. We know whatÕs happened to Christian bakers in Oregon, Christian florists in Seattle, Christian photographers in New Mexico Ñ all because they honored their faith.  The state, meaning the progressive socialist ideological government, has declared that you can have your faith, your religious belief, but THEY will determine the level of your freedom.  As a matter of fact, ask the Little Sisters of the Poor how the government is determining how, where and when they can practice their religious beliefs. The government has decided religious beliefs are discriminatory, in their opinion. And any opposition to the opinion of the liberal progressive left, especially from Christians, is met with economic persecution, tyranny, terrorism Ñ just ask the folks in Oregon and New Mexico Ñ and look at the actions of the NCAA and ACC in North Carolina.  So, perhaps in the face of this onslaught, Christians are warranted in having a feeling of hopelessness. However, remember this simple fact from the 2012 presidential election: some 30 million Christians did not vote. Some were registered to vote and did not, others didnÕt even register.  Therefore, if thereÕs a feeling of ÒhopelessnessÓ it is by thine own hand!  Funny, have you ever asked yourself why all these black ministers embrace the progressive leftists who back in 2012 had to vote to put God back into their Democrat party platform Ñ and booed?  Enter our Teaching Pastor Jonathan ÒJPÓ Podluka at Watermark who delivered a powerful message yesterday that must be shared. Pastor JP told us to share his sermon with one person Ñ well, being the overachiever that I am, I am sharing with 2.4 million. JP took his message to us on Sunday from Acts 5:20-42.  ItÕs the story of how the early apostles, post-Pentecost, took to the streets of Jerusalem inspired by the Holy Spirit, to Òspeak to the people of the temple the whole message of this new Life.Ó  Now, of course the progressive socialist left of that day, the Sadducees, werenÕt exactly happy about this. And so they conspired and had Peter, John, and others imprisoned for speaking GodÕs word. Well, an Angel of the Lord came and opened the prison door and released themÉand they went right back to preaching in the court of the temple.  Now, the Sadducees were really torqued, so they called all the branches of the liberal progressive left together which formed the Sanhedrin. These cheeky fellas decided they needed to stop Peter and Company, and demanded they be brought back to stand inquisition.  Once again, they were told not to teach in Òthis name,Ó to wit Peter responded, Acts 5:29-32, (NIV) ÒWe must obey God rather than human beings! The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the deadÑwhom you killed by hanging him on a cross. God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins. 32 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.Ó  Now, you can imagine the anger of the Sanhedrin, the leftists, when faced with this bold, indignant, response from Peter. But, as they plotted to kill them, or unleash the IRS on them, instead they dismissed the Apostles and conversed among themselves. And there was one named Gamaliel who was a well respected member of the Sanhedrin Ñ I actually think Chuck Schumer may be a descendant Ñ who said something so very profound, Acts 5:38-39 (NIV), ÒTherefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.Ó  And so it was, the Apostles were freed Ñ after the Sanhedrin leftists flogged them. Today they just denigrate, demean, disparage and condemn you as being in the Òbasket of deplorables.Ó  But the point is simple: this infantile movement was one of God, and it has not been stopped, and NEVER will. As stated in Isaiah 54:17 (NIV) ÒNo weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and this is their vindication from me.Ó  JP articulated three points for us never to forget:  1. The body of Christ grows stronger in oppositionÉwe thrive and expand, not wither and fade. 2. The Gospel of Christ will not be stoppedÉas long as we are strong and of good courage, Joshua 1:5-9. 3. The Gospel of Christ moves forward through YOUÉGod uses our suffering for sharing His word This is not a situation of ÒhopelessnessÓ for Christians. Imagine what the early Church must have thought as members were being fed to the lions, burned at the stake, and suffered many other horrific trials, tribulations, and persecutions. Then as now, the message was this belief, this movement may exist but it must not be able to be shared, spread Ñ but it has!

[Video] By 100% FED Up -  Sep 19, 2016 96.9K SHARES ShareTweetPlus The reason 858 were given full citizenship is because our director of the Department of Homeland Security is a treasonous radical left-wing open borders advocate who doesnÕt give a damn about AmericaÕs homeland security.    Think about itÉJeh Johnson is responsible for this negligence and enabling of any and all ÒmistakesÓ big and small. He is the director of the DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY yet heÕs a snake who continuously looks the other way while illegals from all over the globe cross our borders. Johnson famously said he felt that illegals were already American citizens:  The nationÕs top immigration officer said that the Ò11 millionÓ undocumented aliens in the United States are Ònot going away,Ó are Òin effectÓ citizens, and added that deporting the few the administration wants out is unpleasant:  THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TREASON! SKIP TO THE 25:00 MARK FOR HIS COMMENTS ON ILLEGALS:  Well, he just made 858 illegals from ÒhotbedÓ terror countries American citizens!   Hundreds of illegal immigrants from terrorist hotbeds who were supposed to have been deported were instead granted citizenship because Homeland Security didnÕt have fingerprints on file to check their identity, the departmentÕs inspector general said in a stunning new report Monday.  At least two of those approved are now being investigated by the FBI for links to terrorism, investigators said. But in most cases, Homeland Security and federal prosecutors have let the illegal immigrants-turned-citizens get away with their potential fraud. Charges were brought in just two of the more than 800 cases identified. One of the persons granted citizenship through the error-riddled process is now a law enforcement officer, and three others worked in security-sensitive fields Ñ including two who worked in sensitive areas at airports. ÒUSCIS granted U.S. citizenship to at least 858 individuals ordered deported or removed under another identity when, during the naturalization process, their digital fingerprint records were not in the DHS digital fingerprint repository,Ó the inspector general said.  The 858 cases involved people from so-called Òspecial interestÓ countries, or from neighboring countries with major immigration fraud problems. Special interest countries are those places the government has identified as posing national security problems to the U.S.  WHATÕS EVEN MORE UNBELIEVABLE:  Investigators late last year identified another 953 cases that also seemed suspicious. The problem, according to the audit, is tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and criminal aliens whose files are so old that their fingerprints are still on paper cards. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that approves applications, wasnÕt checking those paper-based files, so it didnÕt know the aliens were ineligible or had been ordered kicked out of the country already. The inspector general said some fingerprints have been digitized, but it identified 148,000 aliens who have been ordered deported but whose fingerprints are not in the IDENT system the department uses for its fingerprint checks.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesnÕt impact Liberals personally, they remain content.  Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until itÕs time for them decry law enforcement.  Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.  The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is ÒthrilledÓ to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on ChicagoÕs South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.  So much for Òwhite privilege,Ó huh George?! The Chicago environmentalist scumbagsÕ decision contradicts their own charter.  The Obama center  requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. LetÕs see; wrecking the environment for the black manÕs library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

As Written By Allen B. West:  Saturday was the 229th anniversary of the signing of our Constitution. It was also a day when many across the country were focused on their favorite college football team Ñ there were some awesome upsets.  But, it appears there were those whose focus was elsewhere. As you know by now, Saturday saw a rash of terror attacks. And yes, thatÕs what they were. We here at AllenBWest.com express our sincere regards and sympathies to every person wounded in these weekend incidents.  Of course, thatÕs not something our president, B. Hussein Obama could find in his heart to do.  On Sunday, Obama what he does best, and according to the Gateway Pundit,spoke at a high dollar fundraiser at the home of restaurateur Danny Meyer, owner of Shake Shack.  Pool reports from the event show no comment from Obama about the attack that was actually two pressure cooker bombs set four blocks apart. The second one failed to detonate and was taken for examination by authorities. There was also a similar bomb that exploded in New Jersey earlier Saturday that targeted a Marine Corps charity run without wounding anyone while in Minnesota a mass stabbing attack by a Somali Muslim that wounded nine was claimed by ISIS.  Obama did speak about Hillary ClintonÕs troubled presidential campaign against Donald Trump blaming Rush Limbaugh, Fox News and sexism for ClintonÕs flailing campaign.  Now, what parallel does anyone see here Ð the Boston Marathon perhaps? And the fact that once again a pressure cooker device was involved is the exact same tool of terrorism used by the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston.  We also know the terrorist magazine ÒInspireÓ has provided instructions on how to create a pressure cooker bomb Ñ and folks, pipe bombs are a form of IED, improvised explosive device. And the cellphone attachment is textbook jihadist IED template.  But, itÕs not just what happened in New York and New Jersey. In Minnesota a jihadist dressed in a security uniform ran about at the Crossroads Mall in St. Cloud shouting ÒAllahu Akbar,Ó even asking a victim of his stabbing rage if he was Muslim. And if yÕall havenÕt been paying attention, St. Cloud is a hot bed of Islamic jihadist activity and recruiting, within the very isolated Somali community there. In the St. Cloud area, there have been nine terrorist-related convictions of Somali men. All of this happened on Constitution Day, when 37 Americans had the face of Islamic terror Ñ yep, gonna say it Ñ bring harm to them, and perhaps change their lives forever.  Now, the progressive socialist left will do as they do best and attack the messenger here. Their response is always about being thoughtful, nuanced, wise in waiting, cautious, and they always advocate to NEVER jumping to conclusions. I find that so very hypocritical as the left takes a different course of advance when an incident involves our police.  As a matter of fact, it was Barack Obama who stupidly asserted that the Cambridge PD had Òacted stupidly.Ó HeÕs also the same person who, in the face of the San Bernardino and Orlando Islamic terror attacks, where 63 Americans were killed, rushed to conclusion promoting a solution of gun control. ItÕs the same Barack Obama who now wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees into the United States, all on our dime of course. And he seeks to do this as we witness the rise in attacks in Germany and across Europe from an enemy that has infiltrated the refugee flow Ñ as they said they would.  However, the liberal progressive left doesnÕt want to hear the truth or facts. They want to continue to live in their world of rainbows and unicorns. They want to continue down the path of obfuscation, denial and lying to us about the nature and ability of this enemy.  Donald Trump called it a bomb, the left went nuts Ð well what the heck do you call a device that when detonated goes Òkaboom?Ó Investigations are based on trend analysis, and if you observe the trends here, thereÕs a simple deduction because we know the modus operandi Ñ pressure cookers, cellphones. As well, there are those who will dismiss this saying the bombs werenÕt placed in an area with heavy foot traffic and population movement Ñ it wasnÕt in Times Square. Sure, but perhaps this was a rehearsal for something far biggerÉand it is an Islamic jihadist TTP (tactic, technique, and procedure) to lay out a complimentary IED with a primary oneÉwhy? The goal would be to detonate and inflict more damage on first responders and the crowd that gathers to see what happened.  What we need to garner from these events on Constitution Day 2016 is that the progressive socialist left doesnÕt have the common sense to engage this enemy. They prefer to tell us all it was climate change that made the bomb go off. It was the weather that upset the Islamic jihadist in St. Cloud causing him to ask a person hisreligion and stab Americans while shouting a jihadist slogan. Obama, Clinton, Kerry, de Blasio, these are people incapable of doing that which is their primary responsibility: protecting us from harm and danger. They prefer to advocate for an ideological fight Ñ climate change Ñ and play a politically-correct game resulting in Americans being the targets of evil doers.  In the minds of people like Hillary Clinton what IÕm writing casts me as an Islamophobe, and therefore a member of the basket of deplorables. IÕd rather be in that basket, than in the den of dummies who cannot reconcile themselves to understand there is an enemy we must recognize and defeat.  Hat tip to the off duty St. Cloud police officer who shot and took down the jihadist at the Crossroads Mall. I just have to wonder if these idiots whoÕve been taking a knee and spewing word vomit about Òpolice brutalityÓ will take the time to call this police officer and offer thanks? I doubt it, as they represent another group of fools occupying the den of dummies.  As we head into the homestretch of this presidential election cycle, lets all of us deplorables make sure we donÕt have another resident of the den of dummies to be our president.

If the Birther movement is racistÉ does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?  What if that person is É Obama?  Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ÒÒKenyan-born Obama all set for US SenateÓ That was June 2004.  Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article. ItÕs still out there on the internet. HereÕs a screen capture:  HereÕs the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.  And the link to the original.  ThatÕs not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.  That was ObamaÕs publicist. HereÕs the quote:  Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack ObamaÕs then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as Òborn in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.Ó The booklet, which was distributed to Òbusiness colleaguesÓ in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes ObamaÕs anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and WhiteÐwhich Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead. If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?  If his birth in America is valid Ñ as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ÔforeignerÕ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of É whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.  Because if That WASNÕT a lieÉ then something else MUST be.

You know it Ð the claim that Obama was born in Kenya and therefore not eligible to be president Ð the claim that was first implicitly floated by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2007 and 2008. Yes, that one.  It wasnÕt Donald Trump who originally fired up the birther train. He just took it to ridiculous heights.  It was actually a political stunt by Hillary ClintonÕs chief strategist Mark Penn who wrote in 2007: ÒHis [Obama] roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and his values.Ó  Penn also suggested how the campaign might take advantage of this. ÒEvery speech should contain the line that you [Hillary] were born in the middle of America to the middle class in the middle of the last century,Ó he advised Clinton. ÒAnd talk about the basic bargain as about [sic] the deeply American values you grew up with, learned as a child, and that drive you today.Ó He went on: ÒLetÕs explicitly own ÔAmericanÕ in our programs, the speeches and the values.

Bush ran a hard-fought reelection campaign against a popular, if doofy, Democrat opponent John Kerry. For all of his faults, Kerry was far more well-liked and far less scandal plagued than todayÕs Democrat candidate. Bush was able to eke out a reelection victory mostly on the shoulders of his decisive reaction to the 9/11 tragedy.  In fact, the 2004 election made the phrase Òsecurity momsÓ famous, as the once known Òsoccer momÓ had suddenly awakened to our dangerous new world where Islamic terrorism was the reality and her Òmama bearÓ instincts had taken over. The Òsecurity momÓ knew she had to do all she could to care for her loved ones, and that now meant using her vote to keep them safe.  Fast forward 12 years to the 2016 presidential election and the new generation of Òsecurity momsÓ will soon be playing a pivotal role (again) in another national election. The 2016 version of these security minded voters seem to be preparing to hand the presidency to GOP candidate Donald Trump, and the events of this past weekend explain why.  On Saturday morning a pipe bomb exploded just before the start of a 5k fun run in Seaside Park, New Jersey. The event was called off and authorities swept the area finding two more unexploded devices. Later that night, a pressure cooker bomb exploded in ManhattanÕs Chelsea neighborhood, injuring 29 people and sending the city into a panic. Shortly after the explosion authorities swept the surrounding neighborhood and found another unexploded device a few blocks away.  Come Sunday morning, liberals and their friends in the media were busy condemning Donald TrumpÕs comments about the explosions being ÒbombsÓ and about the likelihood that we were witnessing a terrorist act. TrumpÕs opponents were practically hyperventilating about his ÒrashÓ response and his ÒhasteÓ to judgment, all while arguing that there was Òno evidenceÓ of a connection to Islam or to terrorist organizations.  Then late Sunday evening authorities arrested five Òpersons of interestÓ around the same time that 5 more bombs were being discovered in an Elizabeth, New Jersey train station.  By early Monday morning police had captured Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized American citizen of Afghani descent, who was living in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Rahami, it turns out, was a Òknown wolfÓ with ties to international Muslim terrorism. By the time the East Coast was waking up, liberals were beginning to realize that Donald Trump had been right all alongÉ  Consider New York City Mayor Bill de BlasioÕs comments on Sunday:  Absent a motivation, Mr. de Blasio suggested the word terrorism should not be used, shaking his head in disapproval at the notion that the basic facts of the bombing could be described that way.  ÒHere is what we know: It was intentional, it was a violent act, it was certainly a criminal act, it was a bombing Ñ thatÕs what we know,Ó he said on Sunday, flanked by law enforcement officials at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan. ÒTo understand there were any specific motivations, political motivations, any connection to an organization Ñ thatÕs what we donÕt know.Ó  The liberal reticence at calling terrorism terrorism never ceases to amaze me. ItÕs as though de Blasio believes that if you say the word terrorism you automatically mean that a Muslim person has carried out a violent act. Taking his own words Ð ÒIt was intentional, it was a violent act, it was certainly a criminal act, it was a bombingÉÓ this is the very definition of terrorism. ItÕs an act meant to incite a reaction. The only reason anyone would ever set off a bomb without some other concurring criminal act (like using a bomb to rob a bank), would be for terroristic purposes. Yet, de Blasio couldnÕt bring himself to use the word and instead just described the act of terrorism to reporters. Even New YorkÕs liberal Governor Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), who was slow to call the act terrorism on Saturday, had changed his tune by Sunday. ÒA bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism. A bomb going off is generically a terrorist activity.Ó  But by Monday de BlasioÕs tune finally changed.  ÒWe have reason to believe this was an act of terror,Ó New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said.  A-duh. HereÕs a newsflash, BillÉ every other thinking person in America has already come to this conclusion. Thanks for joining us.  Meanwhile, while de Blasio was busy dissembling, Hillary Clinton was busy using the terrorism to attack Donald Trump for being to hard on terrorism. I kid you not. ClintonÕs argument is that Donald TrumpÕs mean words are going to make the terrorists dislike us even more, so theyÕre going to do more terroristy things.  ÒI donÕt want to speculate but hereÕs what we know about I think it is important for voters to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November,Ó Clinton said. ÒWe know that a lot of the rhetoric used by Donald Trump is being seized upon by terrorists.Ò   Follow  Zeke Miller _ @ZekeJMiller Clinton says Trump's rhetoric has ""given aid and comfort"" to terrorists. Phrase is definition of treason. 7:20 AM - 19 Sep 2016   138 138 Retweets   126 126 likes This is an amazing argument to make, considering that the Obama/Clinton foreign policy era has been one of appeasement and uber-careful rhetoric (when it comes to Islam) and yet, Islamic terrorism is worse today than ever before!  Ultimately, it wonÕt be the cavalcade of corruption, or the litany of scandals, or the lies, or her obviously failing health that ends Hillary ClintonÕs hopes of being President. No, it will be the glaring differences between Clinton and Trump on dealing with the very real threat we face from Islamic terrorism. More Americans will decide that to continue the Obama/Clinton policy of appeasement and apology would be insanity, and that America would be safer handing the reins of leadership to Donald Trump. The liberal response to this weekendÕs terrorism is why Donald Trump will be elected the next President of the United States, and itÕs why the terrorist supporters at CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood are so worried.

GOP Hopefuls, Republican Watch, WTF?  397787 SHARES FacebookTwitterSubscribeRedditStumbleupon Social Security has been called the third rail of American politics: Touch it and you die. And if that is indeed the case, then Donald Trump might want to start picking out a nice casket.  Bloomberg is reporting that when the GOP nominee met with Paul Ryan on May 12, he told the House Speaker that he does indeed favor cutting Social Security, but heÕs afraid to say so publicly because it would doom his chances in November. Bloomberg cites an unnamed source who was in the room when the meeting was held.  According to the source, Trump told Ryan:  ÒFrom a moral standpoint, I believe in it. But you also have to get elected. And thereÕs no way a Republican is going to beat a Democrat when the Republican is saying, ÔWeÕre going to cut your Social SecurityÕ and the Democrat is saying, ÔWeÕre going to keep it and give you more.Õ_Ó  This is in stark contrast to what Trump has repeatedly said on the campaign trail. Trump has said time and time again that he would leave Social Security alone.  Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, believes the real intent of Trump is the same as that of most Republicans: Drastically cutting benefits while pretending to support the program:  ÒIt is really clear: Donald Trump would 100 percent go along with the Republican donor class position of cutting Social Security. He openly says he will lie to the people about it because he knows that the people are against it.  ÒIn his eyes the ÔmoralÕ thing to do is to steal peopleÕs hard-earned benefits and not talk about it.Ó  As we have seen repeatedly during the 2016 campaign, Trump lies about everything, reverses his positions on issues by the hour, and often seems to be utterly lost when asked for specifics about various policy questions. The man is an idiot. He is also a danger to the very essence of American democracy.

Word has leaked that Donald Trump plans to nominate oil executive Forrest Lucas as Interior Minister, breaking the long tradition of naming those from the rural Western states to lead the agency which manages AmericaÕs public parks, lands and wildlife.  This would be disastrous for the fair enforcement of the Endangered Species Act, protecting the environment from the devastating effects of fracking, and animal rights in general, because Forrest Lucas is the sort of man who literally fights for the right to exploit animals in entertainment and is an avowed enemy of the Humane Society which provides low cost veterinary services, spaying and neutering to pet owners across the USA, as Politico writes:  Lucas, who owns a ranch and serves on TrumpÕs agriculture advisory committee, is one of the biggest donors to groups that attack the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and defend animal agriculture, hunting, meat consumption, rodeos and circuses.  Another source with knowledge of the transition operation said Lucas was on a short list of about five names that are under consideration for the post, which has started to attract considerable interest from prominent Òanti-conservation zealots.Ó In a public hint of the rampant nepotism that Trump is planning to make official policy, they even said that the infamous cheetah killer, TrumpÕs self-entitled son Don Jr., is also in the running for Interior Secretary.  The Interior Ministry quite literally owns 28% of AmericaÕs land, manages our national parks and forests, the federal Fish & Wildlife Service, and also makes major decisions in the gambling industry because of its oversight of the commission that regulates tribal casinos. The Department of Interior holds massive sway over mineral extraction rights and leasing on public lands too, so the oil industry relies on it for decisions, regulations and pays rent to Uncle Sam through that government agency too.  The Sierra Club issued a stark warning about what TrumpÕs choice means for the country: ÒPutting an oil executive in charge of our public lands and precious coasts in places like North Carolina, Virginia and Florida is a virtual guarantee that TrumpÕs promise to throw open season on drilling in our special places will come true if heÕs elected.Ó  Lucas is the kind of heartless swine who fought (and thankfully failed) to stop a voter ballot initiative that targeted cruel puppy mills in Missouri in 2010.  ItÕs scary to watch while Donald Trump dangles choices for a powerful appointed public office so outrageous it seems almost comical. If the only two choices are a reactionary oil company oligarch who will certainly plunder our nationÕs natural bounty like a child in a candy shop and supports animal cruelty as a policy platform or the silver-spoon-fed self-entitled neo-Nazi misogynist scion who takes pleasure in slaughtering defenseless endangered animals with high-powered weapons, one might ask if this was a made-for-TV movie. But Donald Trump is very serious Ð as is the threat he poses to our country.

At least one known death was attributed to Bridgegate by the news media.  Even though Christie isnÕt a defendant in todayÕs court action, the stunning revelation from prosecutors means they may still see him as the ultimate target of their three year criminal investigation, as NJ.com reported:  U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna, describing the chaos of the traffic jams that paralyzed Fort Lee beginning on Sept. 9, 2013, said David Wildstein,  a former Port Authority employee who plead guilty to federal charges last year, will admit he was the one who came up with that idea. The prosecutor added that Wildstein will testify he and Baroni told Christie about the scheme at the very moment traffic was at a standstill in Fort Lee during a Sept. 11 commemoration Manhattan.  ÒThe evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan to punish Mayor Sokolich that during those precious few minutes that they had alone with the governor, they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned. This case is about the defendants abuse of power and their callous disregard for the people of Fort Lee,Ó said Khanna. Last year, Trump publicly accused Christie of knowing about Bridgegate, but after the former federal prosecutor knocked out Marco Rubio in a primary debate and pledged blind fealty to the orange-faced one, the two Republicans have become nearly inseparable, no doubt brought together over a mutual love of McDonaldÕs.  Federal prosecutors are seeking to convict Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Anne Kelly, who was Governor ChristieÕs deputy chief of staff.  The only thing that the defense, prosecutors and all of the accused actually agree upon, is that the New Jersey Republican knew about his subordinatesÕ political retribution against a local mayor.  In fact, defense lawyers claim that the disruptive shutdown of the George Washington Bridge connecting Fort Lee to New York City now known as BridgeGate had to be covered up to protect ChristieÕs now tarnished political career, because even back in 2013 he was plotting a Presidential campaign:  Defense lawyers have long argued that Mr. Christie, a Republican, and his top advisers were well aware of the lane closings and that they directed the cover-up as they tried to protect the governorÕs political aspirations Ñ saying their clients were Òthrown under the presidential bus,Ó as one lawyer argued on Monday. But this was the first time a prosecutor had pointed a finger at Mr. Christie. And it directly contradicts the governorÕs statements in the three years since the lanes were mysteriously closed, paralyzing the borough of Fort Lee, N.J. As usual, the New York Times understates the forcefulness of Chris ChristieÕs prior defense of his blatant lies in BridgeGate. We uncovered this extraordinary video where the New Jersey Republican spent an astonishing two hours lying to the media in a televised press conference where he plainly claimed not to know anything.  For years, Christie has claimed that he got away with the crime of using his public office for political purposes to harm hundreds of thousands of New York and New Jersey residents stuck in massive traffic jams caused by his irresponsible Republican administration. From the sound of federal prosecutors, it appears that they simply waited until they had every other co-conspirator so firmly within their grasp to serve Christie notice, and heÕs the most likely final target of this prosecution.

H.W. Bush Stuns Republicans, Endorses Hillary  BY GRANT STERN    PUBLISHED ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2016 67.8k SHARESSHARE THIS STORY Republicans have been crossing party lines to announce their votes for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton throughout this yearÕs general election in numbers not seen in decades.  Now, Politico reports that the highest level defection yet comes from former President George H. W. Bush, who revealed to a Kennedy that it was time to go public in favor of the Democratic partyÕs candidate Hillary Clinton:  Bush, 92, had intended to stay silent on the White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump, a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the GOP nominee. But his preference for the wife of his own successor, President Bill Clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy. The Republican PartyÕs embrace of unrepentant racism under Trump is personally stinging to the Bush family after his sons Jeb Bush married women of Hispanic origins and learned Spanish. ItÕs no surprise that the eldest Bush of the bunch would declare early his vote for Hillary Clinton.  Both of TexasÕ major daily newspapers in Houston and Dallas, who are both deeply conservative news organizations, endorsed Hillary Clinton long before this yearÕs presidential debates, which kick off next week.  It must be reassuring to the elder statesmanÕs rare crossing of party lines, knowing that he can trust the depth of Hillary ClintonÕs national security experience and that her relationships with foreign leaders is unmatched by any partyÕs nominee in possibly all of our nationÕs history.  Former President George H.W. Bush wonÕt be the last prominent Republican to declare for Hillary Clinton in this yearÕs General Election, but he is one of the few whose judgement we can actually respect.

With a stroke of the pen Trump pilfered the average wage of five working Americans to payoff his business fines:  Donald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaireÕs for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents. Those cases, which together used $258,000 from TrumpÕs charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against Òself-dealingÓ Ñ which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses. The Washington PostÔs David Farenthold has doggedly chased down every lead from the Donald J. Trump Foundation and is in the process of singlehandedly using a dog-eared notebook (theyÕve shown photos of it) to literally do what the entire news media is afraid of doing: a complete fact check of Donald TrumpÕs dubious history of illegal self-dealing and political corruption.  It was FarentholdÕs investigation which has now caused every major newspaper in Florida to call for a federal investigation into the Trump University pay-for-play scandal where the very same foundation Trump robbed to payoff lawsuits also made an illegal campaign contribution to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.  Now his reporting shows that he used the same foundation to settle a $120,000 fine for Mar-a-lago, TrumpÕs glitzy party palace in Palm Beach and the nationÕs largest private home. Trump was supposed to donate money to a veteranÕs foundation, instead he simply took it from others who donated to the foundation instead. Ironically, it was all because of the size of a flagpole:  In one case, from 2007, TrumpÕs Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole. In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines Ñ if TrumpÕs club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other peopleÕs money, according to tax records. This wasnÕt just charity for the wealthy; it was a direct subsidy to one of the Trump OrganizationÕs most prized businesses. But it wouldnÕt be the only six figure heist engineered by Donald Trump with little more than the stroke of a pen. When you watch Donald Trump pitch his golf course in Scotland on a campaign trip, just remember that the mismanagement of his expensive golf courses frequently land the Republican nominee in court.  WaPo reports that:  One of TrumpÕs golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiffÕs chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records. On top of that, Trump also used his charitable foundationÕs funds to buy a 6-foot tall oil canvas painting of himself and a $12,000 Tim Tebow football helmet. The latest find by Farenthold uncovered that he spent another $10,000 on second portrait of himself as well as $5000 for advertisements for his chain of hotels. We hear that the latest of TrumpÕs charitable oil-on-canvas selfies is smaller.  The New York Attorney General has already opened an investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation for its illegal transaction with FloridaÕs Attorney General, and these new revelations appear to fit right in with the pattern of the RepublicanÕs nominee for President which we know all too well by now. Donald Trump is all too happy to lie or cheat or steal, as long as he can get away with it.

Ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in Chelsea, New York City, Trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points Ð vilifying Syrian refugees. ÒThese attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our countryÓ yelled Trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on September 19th.  He later went on FOX News and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: ÒThink of it, Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart. ItÕs sickness, and itÕs hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.Ó  In fact, Mr. Trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized American citizen Ð and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a Sikh immigrant, Harinder Bains. He is the owner of the bar in whose doorway Ahmad Rahami decided to take a nap in. When Bains saw the manÕs face on CNN, he did what any responsible citizen would do.  He called the cops.  ÒI did what I think every American would have done. My neighbor would have done the same thing. Any Jewish, Christian, Sikh, Muslim. Anybody would have done the same thingÉIÕm from Sikh faith. IÕve been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecutionÓ said Bains to CNNÕs Chris Cuomo.  HeÕs absolutely right Ð because our nation is a nation of immigrants. All of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. Nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on Syrian refugees because theyÕre Muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low.  Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States.   The chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. Mr. BainsÕ actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. When immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would.  For instance, the Orlando shooter was reported to the FBI by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of MateenÕs radicalization; racist Trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. Mr. Trump and his campaignÕs racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. He is the real threat to America Ð not refugee or immigrants.

This Tweet Proves Him 100% Wrong.  BY LOU COLAGIOVANNI   PUBLISHED ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2016 10.9k SHARESSHARE THIS STORY Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims to have Òa great relationship with the blacksÒwhile nearly every poll shows Trump losing the constituency by 80 percent or more. One of TrumpÕs vile advisers went so far as to say Trump doesnÕt speak in front of predominately black crowds because he fears for his life, and with TrumpÕs recent disgusting comments in North Carolina about black voters, it is no surprise as to why.  The failed businessman gave a rambling, fact lacking, nonsensical speech in Kenansville, North Carolina where he lamented about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary ClintonÕs lack of foreign policy experience, despite Clinton being the most qualified presidential candidate in American history. After TrumpÕs failed attack, he moved on show the nation why black voters do not support his candidacy :  Our African American communities are in the worse shape theyÕve ever beenÉ Ever. Ever. Ever. This single tweet explains TrumpÕs racism perfectly:  tweet    It is quite convenient for Trump to neglect eras of history in the United States where black individuals were in, as he put it, Òworse shape.Ó Apparently, Trump forgot the ancient times of less than 60 years ago, where black people were dehumanized, beaten, and shot with fire hoses while they attempted to fight for equal and fair treatment under the law.  If Trump were to look at his history book, which isnÕt going to happen because the only books he owns are about how Hitler was a swell guy, heÕd find it wasnÕt until 1967 that the Supreme Court struck down anti-interracial marriage laws in seventeen states making it legal for black and white people to marry anywhere in the United States.  Perhaps the fake billionaire meant that black people were better off in America as slaves? That would be one of TrumpÕs best business concepts towards profits. Trump would reason black individuals would be fools not to prefer slavery, as they would be losing out on confirmed lifelong job security.  The pandering by Trump to the vilest racists among his ignorant constituency is no longer a dog whistle, but a blatant declaration that America as a nation is divided by race. He is implicitly longing to return to an era of segregated bathrooms, restaurants, and water fountains.  Trump highly preferred America when good honest white folks were given all of the best seats on public transportation, and black people, of who Trump said Òlaziness is a trait in black peopleÓ is doing them a favor by forcing them to walk to the back of the bus.  TrumpÕ deplorable Ôs character is on display for all to see, and his ignorant comments have done him no favors in helping to win over a key constituency he needs to win if he hopes to capture the White House.  Despite North Carolina being the state with the 7th largest black population, there is willy-nilly a black face in the entire crowd.

It was all too much for one small town Ohio police chief, and his moving words have started gone viral on social media according to PINAC News:  But Middletown Police Chief Rodney Muterspaw said he could not remain silent after watching Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby shoot and kill Terence Crutcher, tweeting the following message Tuesday, which has been retweeted almost 6,000 times as of this writing. The video showing an Oklahoma cop shoot and kill Terence Crutcher after he had his hands in the air, only to later claim he was not complying, is so outrageous that even an Ohio police chief took to social media to voice his disgust. And that is something we never see. According to local media in his hometown of Middleton, Chief Muterspaw wrote on his Facebook page that if police officers ÒcanÕt do the job or are scared of people different than you, then get out of the job. You are making us all look bad. STOP.Ó  ÒIt could be us tomorrow,Ó Muterspaw told the Journal-News. ÒYou have to look at it. ItÕs not second-guessing anybody. ItÕs training for us. ItÕs a chance to learn from it. We are not robots. We have an opinion too. If it makes our department better and keeps our officers safer, if it makes the city better we should speak out about it.Ó He said Middletown officers have removed 137 weapons from suspects this year without firing their guns. Then he went onto twitter and fired off a pair of tweets heard round the world. HereÕs the ChiefÕs two public tweets, which were embedded into PINAC NewsÕ story before he took his account private after gaining national attention:  screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-53-12-pm  The message isnÕt resonating in Tulsa, where officers have stuck to their hokum story that Terence Crutcher tried to reach into his car window for a gun Ð even though a video shows clearly that the window was closed. Now officers are trying to slander Crutcher claiming that itÕs all a drug related issue, an obvious attempt to discredit their dead victim Ð which curiously, they hadnÕt tried to do until his killing gained national attention. In any case, we donÕt recall drug posession carrying the death penalty in United States of America, or the suspension of his right to a fair trial. Now Department of Justice officials are going to investigate the Tulsa officer who killed Crutcher, and with any luck field criminal charges against the cop whose story has frequently changed to desperately try and justify her lethal actions.  Chief MuterspawÕs impassioned call to the professionalism of police, to empathy in their daily life and his commitment to less violent policing is a lesson that one good cop wonÕt spoil the bunch. Sadly, this is newsworthy because heÕs quite possibly the only high ranking police official in America who is (or was) openly siding with Americans, and siding with citizens right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Long before Trump began his run for president where racism, bigotry, hatred, division, and fear became the pillars of his campaign he was studying the work of man who is responsible for the third-most murders in human history. According to a 1990 Vanity Fair article written by Marie Brenner, TrumpÕs ex-wife Ivana, spilled the beans on TrumpÕs love affair with Hitler:  Ivana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of HitlerÕs collected speeches, My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. Kennedy now guards a copy of My New Order in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade. HitlerÕs speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist. When the pathologically lying Trump was confronted about owning the book he feigned ignorance. The interviewer asked him, ÒDid your cousin John give you the Hitler speeches?Ó Trump was shocked and attempted to deflect the question by asking a question, ÒWho told you that?Ó but he then confirmed he owned the book, ÒActually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of ÒMein KampfÓ, and heÕs a Jew.Ó  That Trump would even admit to owning the book is bad enough, but his justification for owning the book offers a window into his contorted carnival house of mirrors logic. Trump reasons itÕs okay to read about Hitler hating Jews, because his Jewish friend gifted it to him, and wouldnÕt it be rude to discard the gift without giving it a thorough read?  Trump lied about lying, as is his standard fare. Marty Davis did indeed confirm giving Trump the book, but it was HitlerÕs ÒMy Jewish OrderÓ not ÒMein Kampf.Ó Whether or not that is worse is up for debate. Davis went on to say he isnÕt Jewish, but that he and Trump are friends.  Then, likely after realizing he had outed himself as xenophobic towards Jewish people, Trump back peddled claiming even if he had HitlerÕs book he wouldnÕt read it. Trump said, ÒIf I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.Ó What does he mean heÕs not saying he has the speeches? He literally confirmed he had them moments earlier!  While it is an exercise in oneÕs gag reflex to picture Trump in bed, it is natural to picture him with a Nazi swastika draped over his headboard, while filling his brain with strategies to bamboozle and terrorize the public. TrumpÕs campaign has been ripped from HitlerÕs playbook of demonizing minorities and blaming them for the ills of a nation, which is all the more reason why Trump must be prevented from winning the presidency in less than seven weeks. If Trump has been studying Hitler for almost 30 years it is too generous of a leap to believe Trump was only interested in HitlerÕs rise to power, and in fact will continue to crib HitlerÕs strategies if and when he assumes power himself.

The assailant allegedly screamed Òthere you go, Muslim!Ó as he hurled what is assumed to be an  improvised incendiary device into the vehicle.  The victim was rushed to the hospital and is being treated for severe burns.  The fearmongering rhetoric of Donald Trump and the far-right wing has lead to an appalling uptick in anti-Muslim attacks, the frequency of which increased by a staggering 87.5% after Republican nominee Donald Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.  Such heinous attacks only serve to divide us and make us less safe. It intensifies the perception that Muslims are not welcome in the United States, and it is precisely that kind of alienation that creates fertile ground for predatory radicals to work their pernicious evil. Jihadi propaganda relies on the central argument that Western ÒcrusaderÓ culture despises Muslims and that Islamic culture is incompatible with the West; these kind of attacks only prove their point.  ThatÕs why Donald Trump has been featured in recruitment videos from brutal jihadi groups like Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) and SomaliaÕs al-Shabaab. Former CIA director Michael Hayden explained that ÒWhen Mr. Trump says some of the things that he has said Ñ Ôthey all hate us,Õ Ôwe shouldnÕt let any of those people in our countryÕ Ñ what he does is underscore and underpin the fundamentals of [the ISIS] narrative of undying enmity. We donÕt have radicalized communities in the United States.

Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, Òoh, absolutely.Ó  Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.  ÒIt wasnÕt a gunshot,Ó she told us. ÒIt was much louder. It wasnÕt a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way.

As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.  It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was Ôentirely too loud for a gunshot too.

TrumpÕs latest escapade has been to swindle $1.6 million from the U.S. Secret Service for the honor and privilege of protecting him, according to FEC filings.  The Secret Service has a policy of reimbursing the campaigns of presidential candidates for the costs incurred due to various agents traveling with the candidate.  Typically a campaign will pay for the airfare of the Secret Service, and the campaign is then reimbursed those funds. However, Trump has found a way to make a profit through this policy by chartering planes to the Secret Service owned by, TAG Air, Inc, one of his companies. Therefore, the Secret Service Ð and the American taxpayer- are literally paying Trump.  This is in sharp contrast to Hillary ClintonÕs campaign which has been chartering planes through Executive Fliteways, to which Clinton has no financial dealings or hopes of personal reimbursement. OneÕs imagination does not require a stretch to see the outrage amongst fanatical Trump supporters if Clinton were profiting from her travel, but selective outrage is their stock and trade.  TrumpÕs campaign says there is nothing illegal about what theyÕve done. A spokeswoman of TrumpÕs campaign, Hope Hicks, said, ÒEverything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.Ó  Along with Secret Service payments, Trump may also be soaking news organizations for the costs of journalists traveling with his campaign for the same reasons. It is also possible the Secret Service has been forced to pay Trump when their agents sleep in his grotesque golden hotels, as Trump stays at his own properties whenever possible. This is likely because he enjoys sleeping on the cheapest Chinese made beds money can buy.

Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the partyÕs nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not.  ÒWeÕre going to be here next week. WeÕre probably going to have some downtime,Ó Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. ÒThereÕs no reason we couldnÕt vote.Ó Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton FoundationÕs returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.  In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!  But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on RomneyÕs taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the DemocratÕs numerous public statements. According to The Hill:  Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is Òethically compromisedÓ and the Òking of the welfare kings.Ó Ironically, RomneyÕs father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.  American voters deserve to know whatÕs inside Republican nominee Donald TrumpÕs tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary ClintonÕs finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.

HeÕs surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; heÕs being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.  Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. ÒFor the record, I have ZERO investments in RussiaÓ he tweeted in July. Now Ð brace yourself, this might come as a shock Ð it appears heÕs been lying to us the whole time.  An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has Ònumerous tiesÓ to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. ÒThe level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars Ñ what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associateÑ[and] be associated with Donald TrumpÓ says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.  Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to Òlarge numbersÓ of Russian buyers Ð so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as ÒLittle Moscow.Ó  The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.  The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense Ð they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.  ÒI think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumptionÉThey donÕt read books. They donÕt go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yachtÓ says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as Òcultural ignoramusesÉnot interested in social justice.Ó Sound like anyone we know?  When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following MoscowÕs annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves Ð and Trump himself. ÒWeÕll be looking at that, yeah weÕll be lookingÓ said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.  These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, itÕs that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the ÒBridgegateÓ scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:  The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict. Chris Christie is also Republican PresidentialÕs nominee Donald TrumpÕs transition team chairperson.  Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person  in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the worldÕs busiest bridges.  Governor Christie was TrumpÕs most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major ÒconservativeÓ Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on TrumpÕs benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.  Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. ItÕs have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican GovernorÕs the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.  Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.  The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administrationÕs bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this yearÕs Republican Presidential campaign.

09/21/16 07:48 AM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Lingering questions about Hillary Clinton, her email arrangement and alleged pay-for-play with the family foundation during her four years at the State Department are not a distraction, spokesman John Kirby emphasized Wednesday.  During a sit-down on ""Fox & Friends,"" Kirby faced off with questions about the situation on the ground in Syria and the issue of vetting refugees to the United States before co-host Brian Kilmeade posed a question about Clinton and then took a step back to ask the rear Navy admiral what he thought about such questions.   ""How much harder is your job being that you had all these things to handle as well as trying to justify what Hillary Clinton did over the last four years? Most of your job is questions about her four years,"" Kilmeade asserted. And it must be -- you must be saying to yourself -- can I just do this job? How much of a distraction has this been?""  ""Look, the jobÕs hard enough, being a spokesman is tough in any environment. And there's a lot going on in the world,"" Kirby responded. ""What we've tried to focus on with respect to this particular issue is our responsibilities at the State Department and explaining the policies and regulations that were in place then, the ones that are in place now, and how we're trying to improve going forward.""  Noting that Secretary John Kerry ""has been very, very open and forthright about admitting we can do a better job with our records management at the State Department,"" Kirby added, ""We want to be more transparent.""  ""You sure? I mean, just don't jump to conclusions,"" Kilmeade said.  ""We know we can do a better job with records management. And he's hired a former ambassador to come in and do nothing but help us be better at transparency,"" Kirby continued. ""Look, I don't view it as a distraction. It's part of my job. When you stand up there every day, that's what you gotta do."""	9/21/16	link	mostly true		1	18	1762317591679	1.02E+16	mainstream	Politico	https://www.facebook.com/politico/posts/10153846364036680	"Former CIA chief: Obama's 'retrenchment' like Trump's 'America First' By NICK GASS 09/21/16 07:25 AM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter President Barack Obama and Donald Trump are alike in at least one regard, according to former CIA Director Michael Hayden.  ""You know, last week I mentioned there was difference in language between Mr. Trump and President Obama. You know, there's not a whole lot of difference between the Obama administration's retrenchment and Mr. Trump's America First. There are common themes there,"" Hayden said Wednesday on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" during a discussion of Obama's final United Nations address.   Hayden, who served as CIA director under George W. Bush from 2006-2009 and briefly under Obama, remarked on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" that the last Republican president ""probably would have been challenged to make a speech so eloquent as President ObamaÕs yesterday,"" while adding that Bush ""would have done so much behind the scenes.""  ""I sat in the Oval Office. We had a meeting and he would just turn over his shoulder and say, ÔGet me [former Pakistani President Pervez] Musharraf.Õ He actually worked on the issues and invested his personal energy and I should add personal prestige and political capital in risking that in order to make things different in the world,"" Hayden said. ""And sadly, I just don't think we're seeing much of that in the last half a dozen or eight years.""  Former Bush aide Nicolle Wallace offered her own criticism of Obama's speech, noting that she heard from Middle Eastern leaders would likely describe the president's address as ""probably decent and perhaps elegant analysis, but he's not an analyst.""  ""What they heard was the complete lack of any connection to any world leaders. He didn't give a speech in that room as though he were in constant contact with anybody else in the room,"" Wallace said.

That could be a nightmare in the making for whoever wins the White House.  Any individual senator Ñ from Elizabeth Warren on the left to Ted Cruz on the right Ñ could almost single-handedly block the new presidentÕs Cabinet picks, depending on which party is in power. If you think the past several years of Senate gridlock have been bad, that might look like a joy ride by comparison.  ÒItÕll be a whole new shooting match,Ó said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.).  ÒOne of the concerns that I have is that [with] the rancor of this campaign, everybody will feel like itÕs still open season on whoever the elected president is,Ó said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). ÒI hope we can get beyond that.Ó  The SenateÕs unique power over confirmations means the chamber will be called upon early and often to ratify the Cabinet selections of the new president, whether itÕs Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. The election outcome could have a big bearing on that: What once looked like a potential wave year for Democrats has tightened to the point that an evenly divided Senate has become a real possibility. That would leave virtually no margin for error when it comes to approving the presidentÕs team next year.  ÒWeÕre looking at a Senate somewhere between 52 and 48. Probably the outside numbers are 48 for one side and 52 for the other,Ó said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who himself is up for reelection. ÒIt could be a tied Senate.Ó  That outcome would also present a new test for the relationship between Capitol Hill and the White House. The confirmation process has grown ever more partisan over the past 15 years, despite the move by Democrats to weaken the filibuster so that all nominees except those to the Supreme Court can be confirmed by a simple majority.  Ted Cruz is pictured. | AP Photo Cruz warms to Trump By BURGESS EVERETT The most likely Senate makeup is 51-49, or 50-50, in which case ties would be broken by the vice president. Democrats fear that even if Clinton wins but Republicans keep the Senate, the GOP would drag its feet on her Cabinet picks and hobble her administration out of the gate.  ÒIf you have President Clinton and a Republican-controlled Senate, as weÕve seen with judicial appointments, the majority leader has the ability to obstruct virtually at will,Ó said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). ÒBy refraining from bringing nominations to the floor, that could single-handedly prevent the president from confirming her team.Ó  Warning shots are already being fired. On Wednesday, Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, gave a speech at the Center for American Progress that included a sharp signal to Clinton not to pick insiders with ties to the financial industry for her administration.  ÒWhen we talk about personnel, we donÕt mean advisers who just pay lip service to HillaryÕs bold agenda, coupled with a sigh, a knowing glance and a twiddling of thumbs until itÕs time for the next swing through the revolving door,Ó Warren said.  Moderates are already entertaining what it will be like next year to hold the keys to ClintonÕs Cabinet. Five senators from red states are running for reelection, and several from purple states will be up for reelection, and any one of them could accrue effective veto power over nominees who rub them or their state the wrong way.  ÒSenators who are up in 2018 are already talking about it,Ó said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).  The Senate dynamics surrounding Supreme Court confirmations and legislation probably wonÕt shift much, since they need 60 votes to move forward.  Outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) recently urged Democrats to scrap the supermajority requirement even for bills if they win back the chamber. But itÕs unlikely the party would go there, at least for now.  162109-chris-murphy-congress-getty-1160 Senate backs tank sales to Saudi Arabia By JEREMY HERB and SEUNG MIN KIM Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), a stalwart liberal in the caucus, said he is ÒcautiousÓ about dumping the 60-vote threshold on the legislative filibuster anytime soon.  But Òif the Republicans are now into almost a decade of a lack of good faith and cooperation, then I think we have to reconsider everything,Ó Schatz said. He added: ÒMost of us are not anxious to move in that direction, but if we canÕt function, then what is it exactly that weÕre protecting?Ó  Republicans say that wonÕt be necessary.  ÒI do hold out some hope that knowing [ascending Democratic Leader] Sen. [Chuck] Schumer the way I do Ñ he and I work well together Ñ that we can find ways to build consensus,Ó said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). ÒItÕs clear that voters donÕt like the direction of the country now.Ó  Republicans say they hope to play nice on nominees, too Ñ even if Clinton is president. But thereÕs a lot of bad blood from the Obama era: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) kept Attorney General Loretta Lynch waiting for weeks last year and has refused this year to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. Democrats, for their part, changed the SenateÕs rules and spent more than a year in the majority confirming lifetime judges over the objections of GOP leaders.  Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Wendy Long speaks during a 2012 debate. Schumer opponent calls for end of federal student loans By NICK NIEDZWIADEK GOP senators said in interviews that the best way for the White House to get in sync with the Senate is to begin voting on the least controversial judges and Cabinet positions and get in a rhythm Ñ rather than first take up nominees viewed as partisan or controversial.  ÒThe first ones that they send up will set the tone for a lot of that,Ó said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the Senate Foreign Relations chairman. Selecting Òsome radical,Ó he added, Òwould not be a great way to start the process.Ó  And there are a couple of remaining moderates in the GOP conference, most notably Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. She said that unless there are ÒintegrityÓ issues with a nominee, sheÕs inclined to help confirm the person. That could be a lifeline for Senate Democrats if every confirmation vote turns into a squeaker.  ÒI hope weÕre not going to get into blocking Cabinet nominees for the sake of blocking them,Ó Collins said.

In a four-way race that also includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Trump leads Clinton 43 percent to 40 percent in Nevada, 45 percent to 40 percent in North Carolina and 42 percent to 37 percent in Ohio.  Johnson polled at 8 percent in Nevada and at 6 percent in both North Carolina and Ohio. The only state in which Stein registered any support was Ohio, where she polled at 2 percent.  President Barack Obama won all three states in 2008 and took Ohio and Nevada in his 2012 reelection campaign. All three are essential for Trump, who faces a relatively narrow electoral path to the White House relative to Clinton.  The Fox News poll is good news for the Trump campaign after a fresh NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released earlier Wednesday showed Clinton with a 6-point lead nationwide.  The Fox poll also shows Republican Senate candidates in each state with leads over their Democratic opponents. The biggest advantage of the three belongs to incumbent Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, who leads former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland 51 percent to 37 percent. Another incumbent, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, leads Democrat Deborah Ross by 6 points, 43 percent to 37 percent, while GOP Rep. Joe Heck leads Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto by 7points, 43 percent to 36 percent, in the race to fill outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry ReidÕs Nevada Senate seat.  In North CarolinaÕs gubernatorial race, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory holds a small lead despite the still-swirling controversy surrounding his decision to sign into law a bill perceived by many to be discriminatory against transgender individuals. The incumbent GOP governor leads his Democratic challenger, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper, by a 3-point margin, 46 percent to 43 percent.  The Fox News poll was conducted Sept. 18-20 via both landlines and cellphones. It reached 704 likely voters in Nevada, 734 in North Carolina and 737 in Ohio.

Who Knows? TelevisionÕs 'Designated Survivor' imagines a hapless cabinet secretary becoming president. The truth about succession is way less certain. By GARRETT M. GRAFF September 21, 2016  Facebook  Twitter  Google +  Email  Comment  Print MOST POPULAR  Kellyanne Conway strays from media critique to praise some print reporters Dems to unveil populist agenda showing Sanders' sway Sanctuary cities crackdown threatens government shutdown What Kansas DidnÕt Do for Democrats Putin Hoists Trump on His Own Fake News Petard The Òdesignated survivorÓ has long been one of WashingtonÕs favorite parlor gamesÑimagining what America would be like if a catastrophe befell the capital during a State of the Union and the most powerful office in the land were delivered unwittingly to the cabinet official who had been hidden away as the president-of-last-resort. What would America have looked like under President Jeh Johnson (2016)? President Ernest Moniz (2014)? Or even President Alberto Gonzales (2007)? And then there are the weirder examples: In 2001, had a catastrophe occurred during the inauguration, Americans expecting Republican President George W. Bush might have instead found themselves with a Democratic president named Larry Summers.  The idea is startling enough to fuel a new Kiefer Sutherland TV drama, Designated Survivor, in which the 24 actor plays a hapless Housing and Urban Development Secretary who finds himself ushered into the White House after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol.  You might assume that for something as important as presidential succession, the world's most powerful nation has it down to a science. ThatÕs the scenario that Hollywood lays out in the show premiere tonight: Sutherland, who just minutes before had been headed to political obscurity in a low-profile ambassadorship, is instead ushered into the White House by an efficient set of government minders.  But in reality, the system is far less clearly delineated, and dogged by questions that are likely to begin the moment itÕs pressed into action. IÕve spent the last three years researching a forthcoming book on the governmentÕs doomsday plans, and one fact that emerged starkly is just how uncertain the whole process is. The system of presidential succession is relatively new, and in many cases it's surprisingly unclear who becomes president. As legal scholar Akhil Amar, who had long studied the legalities of succession, told Congress during one hearing after 9/11, ÒThe current Presidential succession Act, 3 U.S.C. section 19, is in my view a disastrous statute, an accident waiting to happen. It should be repealed and replaced.Ó  Indeed, the presidential succession plan is the rare Washington story thatÕs even strangerÑand contains even more unexpected twistsÑthan the Hollywood version. For one thing, the system, known as Òcontinuity of government,Ó is vastly larger and more complicated than most people realize. While attention usually focuses on the main presidential successor, during high-profile events a much broader shadow government often waits in secure undisclosed locations. During President ObamaÕs inauguration in 2009, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates was the designated presidential successor, James ClapperÑthen the undersecretary of defense for intelligenceÑwaited out the swearing-in at the PentagonÕs secret Cold War bunker in Pennsylvania known as Raven Rock, ready to step into GatesÕ role as defense secretary if the need arose.  But the even weirder thing is what might happen after a disaster. In fact, had Gates emerged from a cave to claim the presidency on January 20, 2009, it mightÕve only marked the opening gambit in a legal drama that could have played out for days, weeks, or even months as a variety of officials from all three branches of government argued over who could rightfully claim the presidency.  ***  For about three hours the designated survivor teeters on the edge of becoming the most important person in the world. That moment in the spotlightÑor, more accurately, far from the spotlightÑcan be brief. The night in 1997 Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman served as the Òdesignated survivorÓ during one of President ClintonÕs addresses to Congress, Glickman went to New York for the night, with a security detail and the nationÕs nuclear codes in tow, only to find that as soon as the speech was finishedÑand the need for a successor overÑthe security apparatus abandoned him, leaving him in the rain to catch his own taxi home.  The idea of a Òdesignated survivorÓ was formalized by the Carter and Reagan administrations, as White House officials worried about nuclear missiles aboard Soviet submarines that lay off the Atlantic Coast and could have devastated the capital with barely 10 minutesÕ notice.  President CarterÕs White House Military Office in April 1980 had instituted new procedures with FEMA to monitor the attendance of all presidential successors Òat major, publicly announced functions outside the White House complex.Ó While such gatherings of the U.S. leadership had been commonplace in the pastÑat inaugurations, states of the union, state funerals and the likeÑthe rising tensions of the Cold War made government planners questions their wisdom. ÒThe situation provides an inviting target to enemy attack or terrorist activity, and represents an unnecessary risk to national leadership,Ó the White House Military Office wrote, outlining the new procedures.  The 25th AmendmentÑitself a modern relic of the Cold War and fears of nuclear attackÑlays out a seemingly clear line for presidential succession. It flows from the vice president to the House speaker to the Senate president pro tem, then through the cabinet in the order in which the departments were createdÑa quirk that itself makes the Department of Homeland Security secretary, one of the people best qualified to actually assume the presidency in a disaster, actually last in line.  When all those in the line of succession were gathered in a high-profile setting, FEMA was to notify the White House and an aide would recommend to the president which qualified cabinet successors should skip the event. (Constitutionally, foreign-born cabinet secretaries, like current Interior Secretary Sally JewellÑa Brit!ÑdonÕt serve in the line of succession.) It falls to a little-known branch of FEMA, the Central Locator Service, to track the whereabouts of the successors daily, and once a month, after the fact, audit a single day to determine whether it had correctly known where each cabinet member was.  The new White House and FEMA procedures got their first test at ReaganÕs inaugural. The incoming and outgoing administrations had agreed that CarterÕs outgoing defense secretary, Harold Brown, would remain in office past the standard noon departure and ensure that there was a national leader in case something catastrophic happened at the ceremony. ÒBoth sides agreed that something should be done,Ó a FEMA official explained later. Brown only resigned later on inauguration day once the Reagan team was firmly in control of governmentÕs levers.  The Òdesignated survivorÓ program would grow more formal in the years to comeÑthe chosen Cabinet member would receive a Secret Service detail for the length of the event and a White House military aide would arrive for the evening with one of the emergency briefcases known as the ÒFootball,Ó which contain instructions on how to access the nationÕs nuclear weapons codesÑin case the unthinkable happened and the designated survivor needed to be ready to launch an attack.  The Òdesignated survivorÓ program, though, raised a new problem: How would the Òdesignated survivorÓ prove he or she was actually now the president? The government lacked simple procedures for figuring out how to double-check that personÕs identity after a decapitation event. Is the person at the other end of the phone really Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (State of the Union 2012)?  ÒOne of the things we discovered is that there was no authentication system,Ó ReaganÕs first FEMA head Louis Giuffrida said in 1981. ÒIf a successor got on the horn and said, ÔIÕm the successor,Õ and somebody said ÔProve it,Õ [no one could]. So weÕre working on that, and FEMA will be the authenticating mechanism to say, ÔYeah, this guyÕs for real. The presidentÕs gone and we donÕt know where the vice president isÉand this is the man.ÕÓ  In the years ahead, FEMA and the White House worked out an elaborate (and classified) system through which a successor would be able to confirm his or her identity, and in subsequent years the Òdesignated survivorsÓ became a common part of Washington lore, and often yielded amusing stories from those who served. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala recounted the story of how she watched the 1996 State of the Union from the White House and ordered pizza. ÒI took my staff with me and I ordered pizza for them in the Roosevelt Room,Ó she said years later. ÒI went to the Oval Office and for one minute sat in the president's chair and then I got up respectfully and went to watch the speech with my staff.Ó  Yet, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, a bipartisan commission examining the nationÕs succession planning found that oddÑand troublingÑquirks persisted that could lead to serious constitutional quandaries in just the sort of situation that Kiefer SutherlandÕs character, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Tom Kirkman, experiences in the TV show.  As clear as the line of succession may appear on paper, legally it would likely prove a much messier proposition the further down the list you go and cabinet officials become involved. And it could get particularly tangled if the president or vice president is only Òincapacitated,Ó rather than killed outright.  ItÕs not entirely clear, even, that the House speaker or the Senate president pro tem could legally serve as president. Republican Senator John Coryn raised the question during the debate in the early 2000s of what would happen if a speaker of the House or Senate president pro tem ascended to the presidencyÑand then was challenged by the secretary of state who argued that the legislators didnÕt count as constitutional officers, making them ineligible to serve in the presidency. ÒBelieve it or not, the secretary actually has a rather strong case, in my view,Ó Cornyn said. No less an authority than James Madison himself had argued that the congressional leaders were legislators, not constitutional officers, and thus ineligible to succeed to the presidency. As Cornyn said, ÒWho is the president? Whose orders should be followed by our armed forces, by our intelligence agencies and by domestic law enforcement bureaus? If law suits are filed, will courts accept jurisdiction? How long will they take to rule? How will they rule? And how will their rulings be respected?Ó  In the years after 9/11, the so-called ÒContinuity of Government Commission,Ó pushed by American Enterprise Institute scholar Norm Ornstein, who has assumed the role of WashingtonÕs succession Cassandra and has spent much of the last 20 years raising troubling questions about the 25th AmendmentÕs ambiguities, confronted one of the strangest and most nettlesome phrases in ÒCOGÓ operations. ItÕs a seemingly unnecessary aside in the language guiding presidential succession known as the Òsupplantation clause,Ó which held that a Òprior-entitledÓ presidential successor, that is someone who ranks higher in the official line of succession, could supplant a lower-level Cabinet official who was serving as Òacting president.Ó  For instance, in a situation where the president and the congressional leadership was killed, but the vice president only incapacitated, the secretary of state would presumably serve as Òacting presidentÓ until the vice president was able to resume his or her responsibility and become the president. But the Òsupplantation clauseÓ inserted unhelpful ambiguity: Could, after Congress reconstitutes itself, a newly elected speaker of the House or Senate president pro tem insist on replacing the secretary of state even after that person had assumed the office of Òacting presidentÓ? Could a newly elected speaker supplant a president pro tem? Might the presidency swing wildly in a few days, at the height of a crisis, between different officials and different political parties?  The Continuity of Government Commission tried also to tackle an ongoing problem with presidential succession that had dogged the debate for decades: Even with the idea of designated survivors for major high-profile gatherings and all the evacuation systems in place, on a day-to-day basis everyone in the presidential line of succession lives and works in a tiny radius extending a few miles around the White House and the Capitol. ÒIn the nightmare scenario of terrorists detonating a nuclear device, it is possible that everyone in the line of succession might be killed,Ó the commissionÕs executive director, John Fortier, told Congress during one hearing. ÒImagine the aftermath: a parade of generals, governors, and under secretaries claiming to be in charge.Ó It would be the chaos of Al HaigÕs ÒIÕm in control hereÓ statement during the Reagan administration writ larger and more fraught.  One proposal, floated during the post-9/11 discussions, would have created a ÒFirst Secretary,Ó a Cabinet official who would have been first-in-line to the presidency after the vice president and whose sole responsibility would be to remain outside of Washington and be the designated survivor to head the shadow government if a catastrophic event destroyed the capital. It would be a job, in essence, to remain in an Òundisclosed locationÓ until the worst moment of American history.  * * *  Such questions make the nation, under existing rules, particularly vulnerable during presidential inaugurations. The terms of the president and vice president constitutionally expire at noon on January 20th, but their cabinets remained in office until either a resignation is tendered or a successor is confirmed by the SenateÑwhich usually doesnÕt happen for hours or even days after an inauguration.  In 2001, as Fortier, the commission leader explained, a terror attack that targeted George W. BushÕs inauguration, might have left the nation with a president carried over from the previous administration who would then serve until Congress had a speaker or president pro tem who would ÒbumpÓ out the president and serve the rest of the four-year term of office. Fortier said, ÒA country expecting Republican George W. Bush to take office would have found themselves with a Democratic President Larry Summers. As secretary of the treasury, Summers was the highest-ranking Clinton Cabinet member eligible to serve as President.Ó  In 1989, at George H.W. BushÕs inauguration, the situation would have been even more confusing, with the same strange outcome: Michael Armacost, the number three official at ReaganÕs State Department, would have been elevated to president of the United States, for the outgoing secretary of state, George Shultz, and deputy secretary of state, John C. Whitehead, had both resigned before the inauguration. Then, with the House in Democratic hands, a newly chosen speaker could have bumped Armacost and given the nation four years of Democratic rule immediately after it elected a Republican president. In fact, given that the Senate took five days to confirm James Baker as secretary of state after BushÕs inauguration, Armacost remained fourth in line to the presidency for the better part of a week.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum THE FRIDAY COVER ÔWeÕre the Only Plane in the SkyÕ By GARRETT M. GRAFF Armacost went on to serve as president of the Brookings Institution and Summers went on to serve as president of Harvard University, so both men ended up with the title of ÒPresident,Ó butÑhad an unprecedented crisis summoned them to lead in 1989 or 2001ÑitÕs hard to imagine that the ascension of either man to the American presidency would have proved reassuring to the nation in its moment of need.  Unless Kiefer SutherlandÕs drama reopens the debate, there are no plans to fix any of theseÑor a host of otherÑproblems with presidential succession. Congress tabled and ignored the fixes on the table a decade ago, and except for a few lonely congressional voices in the years since, like Rep. Brian Baird, thereÕs been little attention since.

Federal Reserve policymakers on Wednesday kept their key interest rate steady, avoiding a potential stock market disruption and putting the central bank on the sidelines until after Election Day.  Fed Chair Janet Yellen also strongly rejected claims lobbed at her by GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump that she is keeping rates artificially low to boost stock prices and aid Democrats.  ÒI can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy,Ó Yellen said at a news conference after the Fed announced its decision. ÒWe do not discuss politics at our meetings and we do not take politics into account in our decisions.Ó  Nonetheless, the FedÕs actions can have significant political consequences.  The Federal Open Market CommitteeÕs decision means voters are not likely to see big stock-price declines or a slowing economy before the Nov. 8 election. Clinton is counting on slowly improving views of the economy to hold off a late surge from Trump, who has made dissatisfaction with the sluggish pace of growth a centerpiece of his populist campaign. Stocks rose following the FedÕs announcement.  ÒThe Clinton campaign should absolutely breathe a sigh of relief, because the market was just not positioned at all for a rate increase; there would have been total chaos,Ó said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services. ÒLess drama is clearly good for the incumbent party.Ó  At her news conference, Yellen said she saw improvement in the U.S. economy but little evidence of risky inflation. And she said holding off on a hike could allow more people to come back into the labor force.  ÒWe are generally pleased with how the U.S. economy is doing,Ó she said. ÒThe economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought, and thatÕs good news. And remember that inflation continues below 2 percent.Ó  The move cheered investors who have driven stocks to fresh highs this year in large part fueled by the FedÕs continued easy money policy. Yellen and the Fed also offered reassuring words about the state of the economy while pointing to a possible rate hike in December.  http://images.politico.com/global/2015/04/10/150410_robby_mook_gty_1160.jpg Clinton campaign memo outlines map to victory By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI  Ò[T]he labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year,Ó the Fed said in its eagerly awaited statement Wednesday. ÒThe Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.Ó  The FedÕs decision on Wednesday is not a complete victory for the Clinton campaign.  By declining yet again to raise rates, the worldÕs most powerful central bank is signaling that it does not believe the U.S. economy is strong enough for even the slightest tightening of monetary policy. The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. But it has been unwilling to do so again despite an unemployment rate of just 4.9 percent and warnings that inflation could spike in ways that would be difficult for the Fed to control.  The FedÕs target rate is now just 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent, a remarkably low figure this late in an economic recovery that gives the central bank little room to maneuver should a new crisis or recession arise. So the FedÕs move avoids a market meltdown but offers fresh rhetorical evidence for Trump and other Republicans who argue that the economy is extraordinarily weak.  ÒItÕs certainly better for Clinton not to have a negative market reaction, but the story here is also that Fed does not have high confidence in continued improvement in the economy,Ó said Michael Obuchowski of Merlin Asset Management. ÒAnd thatÕs something Trump can talk about, that the economy is so weak the Fed canÕt do anything even though it wants to.Ó  The Fed also reduced its outlook for economic growth this year to 1.8 percent from 2 percent while keeping projections for 2 percent growth over the next two years unchanged.  Trump has made bashing the Fed a central plank in his presidential campaign, repeatedly blasting Yellen as motivated by a desire to protect Democrats. ÒSheÕs obviously political and doing what Obama wants her to do,Ó Trump said on CNBC earlier this month. ÒI think sheÕs very political, and to a certain extent, I think she should be ashamed of herself.Ó  Trump has also said that as president he would replace Yellen, whose term runs until February 2018. And he has ripped the Fed for creating what he has called a Òfalse economyÓ with high stock prices but only modest wage gains and a very low labor-force participation rate.  Yellen pushed back hard on the criticism on Wednesday. ÒThe Federal Reserve is not politically compromised,Ó she said. ÒI canÕt recall any meeting that I have ever attended where politics has been a matter of discussion. I think the public if they had been watching our meeting on TV today would have felt that we had a rich, deep, serious, intellectual debate about the risks and the forecasts for the economy.Ó  Yellen added that the central bank Òstruggled mightily with trying to understand each otherÕs points of view and come out at a balanced place and act responsibly, and thatÕs my commitment to the American people.Ó  Still, some Fed governors appear to agree with at least elements of TrumpÕs critique. Three members of the FedÕs policy-setting committee voted against the latest decision, the largest number in two years. These governors argued for a quarter-point increase.  Some market observers note, however, that investors have already done some of the FedÕs work by pushing up borrowing costs and generally tightening financial conditions without the Fed having to make an official policy move.  ÒWhy does the Fed have to do anything if someone else is already doing the heavy lifting for them?Ó said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. ÒWhy break your back?Ó  As for 2016, Kotok said the decision should be a bit of a boost for Clinton, more because it avoids a nightmare scenario than does much to strengthen the economy.  ÒThis at least doesnÕt hurt her,Ó he said. ÒWhether it actually helps is another question.Ó"	9/21/16	link	mostly true		30	236	5362317591679	1.02E+16	mainstream	Politico	https://www.facebook.com/politico/posts/10153847778051680	"Rouhani: Iran deal able to weather the election By YOUSEF SABA 09/21/16 06:41 PM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday expressed confidence that the landmark nuclear deal between his country and a group of world powers will be able to weather the volatile U.S. election season.

The fundraisers are being asked to ""prepare call lists of prospective donors"" and to recruit at least three people from their home states to raise funds on Tuesday, according to a copy of the invitation.  Two people briefed on the event said it would be geared toward attracting the support of Republican contributors who have yet to commit to Trump financially. Many of the party's top donors have expressed profound reservations over Trump's candidacy and have chosen to direct their funds to down-ballot races.  The push comes amid mounting concern that Trump, who has lagged in the fundraising race, is being outspent and out-organized in the states that will determine the election. Hillary Clinton has outspent Trump on the TV airwaves by a stunning 7-to-1 margin and in many battlegrounds has dozens more offices and field staffers than the Republican nominee.  Through the end of August, Clinton has outraised Trump $373 million to $165 million.  Among those still on the sidelines are many of the GOP's biggest donors. Trump suffered a blow this week when Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson revealed that he would be directing $40 million to Republican groups devoted to protecting the party's congressional majorities and just $5 million toward electing the GOP presidential nominee. Adelson had once been seen as a potential major Trump donor and seen as possibly giving as much as $100 million to boost his candidacy.  Tuesday's event will be hosted by vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and two of Trump's children, Eric and Ivanka. It is being co-chaired by Republican fundraisers Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent Wall Street investor, and Roy Bailey, a Dallas insurance executive. Bailey has long been close with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a prominent Trump surrogate and adviser.  In the invitation, the campaign says it will offer four invitations to next week's presidential debate to fundraisers who pull in at least $250,000 by Friday."	9/22/16	link	mostly true		4	84	6462317591679	1.02E+16	mainstream	Politico	https://www.facebook.com/politico/posts/10153849686251680	"Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump The GOP candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be. By PETER EDELMAN September 22, 2016 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Writing as a former legislative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of Hillary Clinton for president, I was disappointed to see in Politico the screed written by my former colleague, Adam Walinsky, excoriating ClintonÕs record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that Donald Trump should therefore be elected president. It is one thing to disagree with Secretary Clinton, which Walinsky does heatedly, and quite another to turn to Donald Trump.  We should be clear that WalinskyÕs critique is not confined to Clinton. He lays out (and massively overstates) a dark view not just of Clinton but also of President Obama and almost the entire Democratic Party. The analysis is overwrought, but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is Trump.  The question is not whether there is a military-industrial complex in our country. President Eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it. The 21st century version begins with the Iraq War, which was originated by a Republican President. I am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that Presidents Obama, Clinton and Carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways. The question here is whether Donald Trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot.  GettyImages-600031536.jpg 2016 Walinsky: I Was RFKÕs Speechwriter. Now IÕm Voting for Trump. HereÕs Why. By ADAM WALINSKY Walinsky finds in Trump a rationality and consistency that do not exist. Any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment, Trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with NATO and other allies; at another, he will lash out at any perceived insult to the U.S. or to himself, and pledges that AmericaÕs pride needs to be vindicated militarily. ÒAmerica First,Ó Trump says regularly, bringing the isolationism of Charles Lindbergh to mindÑbefore excoriating President Obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has a secret plan to obliterate the Islamic State.  To compare John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy to Donald Trump isÑwell, I wonÕt finish the sentence. Yes, Robert Kennedy turned against the Vietnam War, but not because he felt that America should retreat from the world. He opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on a flawed notion of American interests. The result, as we know, was the death of Vietnamese and Americans and others who should not have died. JFK and RFK were internationalists. They understood that World War II left the United States with a responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world. They understood that America must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue a peaceful world. They understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk. They made those difficult, often excruciating, decisions carefully and as transparently as possible, never rashly, impulsively, or vindictively.  Walinsky quotes Robert KennedyÕs statement that if any member of the ExComm other than John F. Kennedy had been president during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we would have had a nuclear war. Ask yourself what a President Trump might have done in that moment. ÒRestraintÓ is not the word that comes to mind.  This is a man who said he would order the military to kill the families of Muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the United States should have seized IraqÕs oil resources as Òspoils to the victor.Ó  Lead_Getty.jpg HISTORY DEPT.

How Clinton's 'Trump Is CrazyÕ Strategy Could Backfire By JOSH ZEITZ Trump angry WASHINGTON AND THE WORLD What Exactly Would It Mean to Have TrumpÕs Finger on the Nuclear Button? By BRUCE BLAIR Yes, we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors. But electing Donald Trump is not the answer; it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways. The answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither American security interests nor egregious human rights violationsÑa topic in which Donald Trump has shown an ostentatious indifference, as his fondness for Vladimir Putin reflects.  All the evidence, provided again and again by Donald TrumpÕs own mouth, tells us not that he is a man of peace, but that he is a man of no principleÑa man who will say, and possibly do, whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute. He is like the weather in New England: If you donÕt like it, wait a minute. We do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes. We do not know what he knows because, from all we can see, he does not know much.  Even if WalinskyÕs diatribe is correct, which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth, there is nothing in it that justifies turning to Donald Trump. Of all occasions to break ranks with the Democratic Party, this is the most inappropriate. Of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of John and Robert Kennedy, two of our greatest public servants, this is the most egregious I have ever seen.  To say that I am disappointed by what Walinsky has done is an understatement. America, in this election, faces an existential questionÑand history will judge us by our answer. Walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle.

The exchange was first reported by the Daily Mail yesterday, which withheld the name of the girl because she is a minor.  Later Thursday, CNN reported that U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office has subpoenaed Weiner for his cell phone and other records.  Weiner yesterday referred reporters to a statement he had given the Daily Mail, saying he regretted his online conversations but pointing to a letter the girl wrote calling the incident Òa hoax.Ó The girl later recanted that characterization, and shared with the Daily Mail a series of images and messages she said she traded with Weiner up until July.  WeinerÕs 2013 mayoral campaign was rocked by revelations that he had traded sexually explicit messages with a woman after he had resigned from office in 2011. Weiner's resignation was prompted by an exchange with another woman that he accidentally posted to his public Twitter feed.  Mayor Bill de Blasio today said today the situation is ""horrible.""

With spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats Ñ yet still isnÕt enough to get the minority party on board.  Gone is the so-called ICANN provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other GOP senators and just got the seal of endorsement from GOP nominee Donald Trump. It also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in June.  The new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday Ñ which funds the government until Dec. 9 Ñ also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option.  Pat Toomey is pictured. | AP Photo CONGRESS GOP senators succumb to TrumpÕs war on trade By SEUNG MIN KIM ÒThere have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So thatÕs what IÕve just offered,Ó McConnell said. ÒItÕs the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.Ó  But Democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable Republicans leave Washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as Louisiana, West Virginia and Maryland, it doesnÕt include money for the long-running water crisis in Flint, Michigan.  ÒTo put Louisiana in without Flint is like waving a red flag. I don't get it,"" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. ""I havenÕt counted votes but our caucus isnÕt going to like having Louisiana and not Michigan.""  It also does not remove language that prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. That is current law, but Democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. Democrats also floated a provision related to the Export-Import Bank that would have restored the bankÕs full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure McConnell filed Thursday. That Ex-Im provision was also important for some Republicans; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded.  ÒThe president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congress hasnÕt done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,Ó White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, while slamming Republicans for their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank.  Yet McConnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through Democrats. While some leading Senate Democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other Democrats began to side with Republicans. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida has been the nation's epicenter of the Zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat Zika ""with no political riders.""  ""While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida,"" Nelson said.  162009-john-thune-getty-1160 Senate advances budget deal that doesn't exist yet By BEN WEYL, SEUNG MIN KIM and BURGESS EVERETT Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before McConnell went to the floor to unveil it Thursday afternoon.

The president is not going to agree to this. ItÕs really unfair to the American people.Ó  During her weekly news conference earlier Thursday, Pelosi said the legislation, Òin my view, is not even worthy of a counter. It falls very short.Ó  Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top Democratic appropriator, charged McConnell with filing a ÒRepublican-only bill"" and said Democrats would not support the legislation, although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, for his part, is trying to project an air of calm, telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want ""low drama"" in order to solve the government funding impasse. But Cruz is pressuring House lawmakers to fight on behalf of the Internet domain provision that he championed.  ""I am grateful for my Senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""I encourage my colleagues in the House to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the Obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the Internet.""

By ELI STOKOLS 09/22/16 02:19 PM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter PITTSBURGH Ñ Attempting to strike a unifying, presidential tone while commenting Thursday about urban unrest in Charlotte, Donald Trump veered temporarily off-script and attributed the violence Ñ without offering any evidence Ñ to drugs.  ""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television,"" he said.  Following a night of wall-to-wall cable coverage of the violent protests in response to another police shooting of an African-American man, the Republican presidential nominee aimed to square his law-and-order philosophy with his eleventh-hour outreach efforts to the country's African-American communities.  Trump, who trails Hillary Clinton by approximately 80 percent points among African-American voters, explained that his promise to restore order to cities plagued by racial tensions is an effort to protect disproportionately affected minority communities.  ""There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration,"" he said at the beginning of remarks to the Shale Insight Convention.  ""Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children a great education. We have to cherish and protect those people.""  Trump's stated concern is of a piece with his recent visits to African-American churches in Detroit and Flint and his stumping in Ohio Wednesday with boxing promoter Don King, who vouched for the candidate's character.  But his ad-libbed comment blaming drugs for these violent uprisings seemed to validate stereotypes about black communities Ñ seemingly supporting the criticism that Trump's larger outreach effort to African-American voters is really an attempt to convince moderate Republican women that he isn't a racist.  As he often does, Trump praised police officers for risking their lives but acknowledged, as he did on Wednesday, that their judgment in pressure situations is not infallible.  ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed,"" Trump said.  ""But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude.

Asked about her views on the practice, Lynch said she would not be drawn into debate about comments made by political candidates, but she clearly disagreed with the GOP presidential nominee by insisting that the use of the tactic had been counterproductive in New York City.  ""In New York É that practice was implemented in a way that was not helpful to community trust and to, frankly, public safety and enhancing the relationship between law enforcement and community members,"" Lynch said in response to question from POLITICO at a press conference about a crackdown on mail-fraud schemes.  ""The issue with stop-and-frisk in the New York area was the widespread indiscriminate use of that practice, particularly when it was not generating success from a law enforcement perspective, in either leads or tips or firearms, and the resulting lack of trust that it generated,"" the attorney general said.  In an interview Wednesday, Trump called for broader use of stop-and-frisk and specifically praised its success in combating crime in New York.  ""I see what's going on here, I see what's going on in Chicago,"" Trump said in Cleveland during a taping of Fox News' ""Hannity "" ""I think stop-and-frisk, in New York City, it was so incredible the way it worked. And, we had a very good mayor. But New York City was incredible the way that worked. So, I think that would be one step you could do.""  Use of the proactive technique, promoted by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has long angered many civil rights activists. In 2013, a judge in New York ruled that it had been carried out in an unconstitutional, racially discriminatory manner. An appeals court halted that ruling, but while the appeal was pending, the city Ñ under new Mayor Bill de Blasio Ñwound up settling the case.  In comments Thursday, Trump revised his earlier remarks, insisting he was only advocating the practice in murder-plagued Chicago.  ÒI was really referring to Chicago with stop-and-frisk,Ó he told ÒFox and FriendsÓ during a phone interview Thursday morning. ÒThey asked me about Chicago and I was talking about stop-and-frisk for Chicago.Ó  Chicago has seen a spike in murders and shootings, with over 500 killings in 2016 and three months still to go in the year.  ""I think Chicago needs stop-and-frisk,Ó Trump said. ÒNow, people can criticize me for that or people can say whatever they want, but they asked me about Chicago, and I think stop-and-frisk, with good, strong, you know, good, strong law and order. But you have to do something. It canÕt continue the way itÕs going.Ó  Lynch, who spent two stints as chief federal prosecutor in Brooklyn before being nominated as attorney general, said she wasn't opposed to stop-and-frisk techniques under certain circumstances.  ""As with every police procedure we want to empower law enforcement to be responsive to community needs. We want to empower them to protect the community. We want to give them the training they need in order to do it in a way that is constitutional, safe and effective and promotes trust,"" Lynch said. ""ItÕs not really a yes or no answer.""

Trump, who trailed Clinton by 2 points in Iowa in an August Quinnipiac poll, now leads by 7 points, 44 percent to 37 percent. He also leads in Georgia, where likely voters also preferred him by a 7-point margin, 47 percent to 40 percent. Stein earned the support of 2 percent of respondents in Iowa and did not register any support in Georgia, while Johnson polled at 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively.  Both the Clinton campaign and Priorities USA, a super PAC backing the former secretary of state, stopped airing advertisements for her in both Virginia and Colorado over the summer amid a seemingly insurmountable polling advantage. But the fresh Quinnipiac poll shows that advantage narrowed in both states.  In Colorado, ClintonÕs lead has shrunk from 8 points in mid-August to just 2 points in the most recent poll, 44 percent to 42 percent, with Johnson polling at 10 percent and Stein at 2 percent. Clinton's lead in Colorado falls within the pollÕs margin of error, putting the two candidates in a statistical tie in the state.  A collection of Trump's national ads 2016 Trump's bizarre ad strategy By STEVEN SHEPARD In Virginia, the 9-point advantage Clinton held over Trump last month has shrunk to 6 points, 45 percent to 39 percent, in the poll released Thursday. Johnson earned the support of 8 percent of respondents from Virginia while Stein polled at 1 percent there.  The new polls are the latest in an array of positive swing-state news for the Manhattan billionaire, who has polled well in purple states of late. A Fox News poll out Wednesday showed Trump with leads in Ohio, North Carolina and Nevada and a Suffolk University poll released earlier in the day Thursday put Trump narrowly ahead of Clinton.  The news has been better for the former secretary of state in nationwide polls. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday afternoon put Clinton ahead of Trump by 6 points among likely voters across the country. But even if likely voters nationwide prefer Clinton, Trump could still carve a path to the White House with wins in key swing states.  The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted from Sept. 13-21 via landlines and cellphones. It reached 644 likely Colorado voters and 638 Georgians likely to vote, both with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.9 points. The poll also reached 612 Iowans, with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4 points, and 659 likely Virginia voters, with a with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.9 points.

And theyÕre asking him to take advantage of it.  ÒNorth Carolina Republicans are sending the word to the Trump campaign that once this settles down, a visit to Charlotte, to the Mecklenburg police, to the sheriff and others, is something we really want to see,Ó said a high-ranking North Carolina Republican, granted anonymity to discuss political calculations during a sensitive moment for the state. ÒLawmakers and party officials are sending word to the Trump campaign.Ó  The crisis in Charlotte was sparked by the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man who police say was armed, though no video has been released and the family disputes that claim. Since then, the city has been the scene of violent clashes between police and protesters, with the clashes captured on live, national television.  The tumult comes as Hillary ClintonÕs once-formidable lead in state polls has faded. A spate of polls out this week show either a tied race or give Trump a slight edgeÑa sharp contrast from last month, when Clinton was leading by anywhere from 2 to 9 percentage points.  Donald Trump comments on Charlotte Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL and LOUIS NELSON North Carolina political operatives are skeptical that, unless the chaos in Charlotte continues for weeks, the issue will make a substantial dent in the race. But Republicans and some Democrats do say that the dynamic creates an opening for Trump to further shore up and energize the GOP baseÑsomething he has struggled to doÑpredicting voters will respond to his campaignÕs law-and-order message and his staunch defense of police, even amid national concerns over institutional police racism. A senior adviser to the Trump campaign said only that Trump had been in the state earlier this week and ""we have not yet announced the date of our next trip back to the state.""  ÒI certainly think unrest feeds into TrumpÕs narrative that ÔAmericaÕs falling apart, we need to make America great again,ÕÓ said Tom Jensen, a Democratic pollster whose firm is based in North Carolina. ÒMy sense is, most white North Carolinians who would be really repulsed by whatÕs going on in Charlotte would be in TrumpÕs camp. I doubt it moves the needle a lot, but the race is just about tied É something like that is never going to move the race by 3 or 4 points, but it can change the race on the margins, and weÕre on the margins.Ó  Thus far, Clinton has largely stuck to tweeting in support of Scott, rather than commenting on the Wednesday night protests. And Trump was vague in a Fox News appearance Thursday morning, lamenting the Òlack of spirit between the white and the black,Ó and going on to assert that amid the chaos Òour country looks bad to the worldÓ in a speech later in the day.  But moving the needle even a little may be enough in a state where the polls are tight and thereÕs a history of thin margins.  North Carolina, a typically red state that went for Barack Obama in 2008 before swinging back to support Mitt Romney in 2012, is central to TrumpÕs path to victory, which is narrower than ClintonÕs is. ClintonÕs summer leads in the state were fueled by support from African-American and college-educated voters in a state that is home to the Research Triangle, the Raleigh-Durham area where universities and high-tech companies are based.  But in North Carolina, as in a number of other swing states, her lead has diminished amid scrutiny of her email practices, her health and her overall commitment to transparency. And the protests, Republicans say, may mean more trouble, especially if there are additional nights of strife.  ÒEvery time there is a riot, protest, or general disruption of civility it helps Donald Trump,Ó said Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster who was the director of data, analytics and digital strategy on Ted CruzÕs primary campaign.  The Cruz primary campaign had firsthand experience with this: Protests at a Chicago Trump rally ahead of the March 15 primariesÑwhen a list of states that included North Carolina votedÑdominated the weekend coverage before those races. Wilson said the net effect was boosting Trump across the board in the final days before the Republican contests (though representatives from Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign, also watching their own internal numbers, have said they didnÕt see the same effect).  ÒWe certainly saw this in the primaries as the riots [in] Chicago, prior to a scheduled Trump speech, created a significant lift for TrumpÕs candidacy,Ó Wilson said. ÒNot just in Illinois, but also in Missouri and North Carolina.Ó  The unrest also carries risks for Trump, as the charged racial questions surrounding the issue heighten the possibility of a misstatement, one that could undo a recent effort to fight charges that heÕs a racist candidate. That is a risk for the bombastic Trump, who has a record of horrifying moderate voters in the wake of tragedies (ÒAppreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism,Ó he tweeted, following a shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, though he said he didnÕt want the ÒcongratsÓ).  Police and protesters carry a seriously wounded protester into the parking area of the the Omni Hotel during a march to protest the death of Keith Scott September 21. McCrory calls state of emergency in Charlotte after unrest By CRISTIANO LIMA And the Charlotte situation carries opportunities for Clinton as well. African-Americans, a crucial part of her base, have been outraged by the shooting, the latest instance of a black man dying in an altercation with police (in this instance, the police officer involved was also African-American).  Clinton has been a champion of ÒMothers of the Movement,Ó a group of African-American mothers whose children died primarily in incidents involving law enforcement, and she is a vocal proponent of criminal justice reform. In North Carolina and nationally, her campaign is engaged in extensive outreach to the African-American community.  A senior Democratic operative working in North Carolina said the incidents unfolding in Charlotte underscore the risks African-Americans see in a potential President Trump.  ÒIt is further alienation, a further concern among African-American voters about TrumpÕs presidency,Ó the source said, noting that Trump has a long record of making incendiary comments about minorities.  The strategist said TrumpÕs best-case scenario, politically, is that calls for law and order help him solidify his baseÑbut that doesnÕt move the dial with independent and more moderate voters, the source insisted.  ÒI think Donald Trump continues to solidify his 43 percent of the vote, heÕs not adding votes, heÕs certainly alienating others,Ó the Democrat said, going on to add, ÒIt just confirms to his base all the things theyÕre concerned about are real. But shoring up 43 percent of the vote you have is not the way to get to 50.Ó  And Carter Wrenn, a longtime Republican strategist, said it is not a given that TrumpÕs standing will rise on the other side of the aisle just because of the protests.  ÒIf youÕre living in North Carolina, you turn on the TV and thereÕs riots in Charlotte, thereÕs looting, it gets your attention, but it doesnÕt automatically help one candidate over another,Ó he said. ÒIt depends on how the individual candidate responds. People will watch that. If they think, ÔGosh, TrumpÕs got a lot of judgment, he knows how to solve this,' it will help him. If they think, ÔOld Trump just poured gas on the fire,Õ it wonÕt help him at all.Ó"	9/22/16	link	mostly true		77	514	14662317591679	1.02E+16	mainstream	Politico	https://www.facebook.com/politico/posts/10153850164546680		9/22/16	link	mostly true		20	126	1262317591679	1.02E+16	mainstream	Politico	https://www.facebook.com/politico/posts/10153850194391680	"Trump received $1.6 million from Secret Service The agency pays to travel with all presidential nominees, but in TrumpÕs case, that money went to one of his companies.

Federal Election Commission records show that the U.S. Secret Service has paid the Trump campaign about $1.6 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies.  ItÕs standard practice for the agency Ñ which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials Ñ to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates.  In fact, the Secret Service has reimbursed the Clinton campaign, too: $2.6 million so far this cycle.  The difference with Trump is that one of his companies, TAG Air, Inc., owns the plane, so the government is effectively paying him.  The Clinton campaign, by contrast, mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called Executive Fliteways in which the Clintons do not have any ownership interest.  ÒThe taxpayers are actually reimbursing Trump for the travel of the Secret Service agents,"" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm Akerman LLP. ""It's just another example of how the Trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at Trump-owned facilities.""  16091_trump_family_1_ap_1160.jpg 2016 Trump's campaign paid his businesses $8.2 million By KENNETH P. VOGEL and ISAAC ARNSDORF Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded to questions about the Secret Service payments by saying Òeverything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.Ó  Secret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the FEC Òspecifically requires security personnel such as the Secret Service to reimburse campaigns for seatsÓ on charter aircraft.  A POLITICO analysis of FEC records found that, through the end of August, TrumpÕs campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at Trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his Manhattan office tower.  But the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to TAG Air, Inc.  Trump, who once said ÒI could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,Ó has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. He has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets.  The campaign in a statement on Thursday rejected that criticism as Òmisleading and flat out wrong,Ó pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at Trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that Trump has pumped into the campaign.  The statement explained the campaignÕs payments to TAG Air and other Trump-owned companies by saying Òthe campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.Ó  Donald Trump makes a visit to Stamey's Barbecue on Sept. 20 in Greensboro, North Carolina. Trump forces lagged Clinton in August money race By ISAAC ARNSDORF and KENNETH P. VOGEL The government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their Secret Service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to Craig Engle, a political lawyer at Arent Fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the Federal Election Commission.  ""It's basically just calling it even,"" Engle said. ""It's either Trump making a contribution to the U.S. government, or the U.S. government reimburses the Trump campaign for its expenses.""  The same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. The journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. So itÕs conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the Trump campaign for the cost of staying in a Trump-owned hotel or flying on a Trump-owned plane.  The Secret Service could also end up paying Trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. But those expenses don't appear in FEC reports because the government pays them directly.  The agency paid the Trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the FEC reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund.  Of course, Trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. In August, TrumpÕs campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as Xmark LLC, Black Tie Protection Services and KS Global Group, as well as local police in places he visited."	9/22/16	link	mostly true		1295	2700	43162317591679	1.02E+16	mainstream	Politico	https://www.facebook.com/politico/posts/10153850227336680		9/22/16	link	mostly true		7	65	3462317591679	1.02E+16	mainstream	Politico	https://www.facebook.com/politico/posts/10153850254316680	"Obama, in an awkward twist, becomes Saudi Arabia's defender Long a critic, the president now finds himself in the uncomfortable spot of protecting the austere desert monarchy from Congress.

Now, heÕs the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities.  Obama has cast the Saudis as ""so-called"" allies; bemoaned the terrorist-inspiring version of Islam they practice; and even suggested the oil-rich Arab state learn to ""share"" the Middle East with rival Iran. The Saudis, meanwhile, consider Obama naive, sparring with him over the Iran nuclear deal and questioning his hands-off approach to SyriaÕs bloody civil war.  Despite these differences, Obama has promised to veto a bill that Congress passed unanimously allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia over alleged links to the 2001 terrorist attacks.  That Obama and Riyadh find themselves on the same side against Congress underscores the bizarre evolution of U.S.-Saudi ties over the past eight years. An alliance once unquestioned in Washington now faces an extraordinary level of criticism, but the two countries still need each other enough that a breakup is simply not in the cards.  ""This is clearly a relationship in transition,"" said Jon Alterman, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Nobody really has a sense of what theyÕre trying to transition it to.""  Former Defense Secretary William Cohen is one of several ex-national security experts who the Obama administration is rallying to convince Congress to uphold Obama's veto. Big-name ex-officials urge rejection of 9/11-Saudi bill By JOHN BRESNAHAN Just how tricky is the relationship? Two more examples: Obama is supporting the Saudis in their fight against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, even though U.S. officials worry the fight there is distracting from the more important battle against the Islamic State. And many of the same U.S. lawmakers happy to make it easier to sue the Saudis just this week green-lit a $1.15 billion arms sale to the country. ""Does no one sense the irony?Ó asked Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of a handful of lawmakers who tried to block the weapons deal in the Senate.  The back and forth in Washington is ""schizophrenic behavior"" that has deeply frustrated leaders in the Middle East for years, said a former senior U.S. official deeply familiar with the Arab world.  Congress passed the lawsuit bill under intense pressure from families of victims and just ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The Saudis, through direct contacts as well as a powerful set of lobbyists, have tried hard to stop it, waging a major PR effort that included releasing a white paper detailing the kingdom's efforts to stop terrorists. The Saudis deny any government role in the attacks and note that the U.S. has never found proof of it, either. The Saudis also have warned they will sell off billions of dollars in U.S. assets to protect themselves against lawsuits.  Administration officials downplay the idea that Obama will veto the bill merely to protect Saudi Arabia. Normally, U.S. citizens aren't allowed to sue foreign governments under the concept of sovereign immunity. Obama's concern, officials say, thus goes well beyond the Saudis; he's worried that the bill erodes the sovereign immunity principle and could lead other countries to allow the U.S. to be sued over its actions abroad.  ""To pass a piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our service members and even American businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a recent press briefing.  160920_dianne_feinstein_1_gty_1160.jpg CONGRESS Democrats waver on override for 9/11 bill By SEUNG MIN KIM and HEATHER CAYGLE The perception in many quarters, however, is that Obama is coming to the aid of a country with much to hide. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001, were Saudi nationals. And the recent declassification of roughly 30 pages from a 2002 congressional probe into the 9/11 attacks raised more questions about Saudi government ties to Islamist extremists.  ""We are disappointed that the president is not standing with us,"" said Mindy Kleinberg, who lost her husband in the attacks and was meeting with lawmakers Thursday to push for a veto override. ""We have been waiting a very long time for justice, and we feel that this bill will go a long way toward accountability.""  Whatever his motivation, Obama's decision to veto the bill is unlikely to do much to ease Saudi suspicions.  The Saudis' wariness of Obama has its roots in his comments in 2002, well before he ran for president, referring to the monarchy in Riyadh as a so-called ally. It grew after Obama sided against Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Arab Spring movements, leading Saudi royals to question whether America would have their backs in a domestic political crisis of their own.  It deepened in 2013, after Obama decided not to stage a military strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is despised by the Saudis, even after Assad apparently crossed Obama's ""red line"" by using chemical weapons. And it reached a new peak in 2015 after Obama struck a nuclear deal with Iran, a Shiite theocracy that Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia views as a growing threat in the Middle East.  Still, Obama, cognizant of the need for the U.S. to maintain alliances with stable countries in the Middle East, has otherwise tried hard to allay Saudi concerns. He cut short a trip to India to rush to see the newly crowned Saudi king, Salman, in January 2015, after the previous monarch died. He also has pushed for new weapons and other security agreements with the Saudis, in part to assuage Saudi concerns about the Iran nuclear deal.  Ryan says House will vote to override any veto of 9/11 bill Ryan says House will vote to override any veto of 9/11 bill By HEATHER CAYGLE But earlier this year, in comments to the Atlantic magazine that infuriated the Saudis, Obama appeared to reverse decades of U.S. policy that tilted heavily toward Riyadh and against Tehran.  ÒThe competition between the Saudis and the Iranians Ñ which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in Syria and Iraq and Yemen Ñ requires us to say to our friends as well as to the Iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,Ó Obama said.  Prince Turki Al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence, wrote in an extraordinary open letter soon afterward that Obama had ""thrown us a curve ball"" and criticizing the president for saying AmericaÕs Gulf allies were Òfree ridersÓ wholly dependent on the U.S. for their security.  And in April, weeks after the Atlantic piece was published, Saudi Arabia appeared to snub Obama when he visited Riyadh for a summit by sending a lower-level official to greet him at the airport and not broadcasting his arrival on state TV. The readouts from those meetings in Riyadh also suggested the president hadn't done much to assuage Saudi concerns, with the two sides saying they'd ""discussed"" and ""exchanged views"" more than agreeing on anything.  The president also hosted Saudi ArabiaÕs deputy crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, when he visited Washington this summer on a trip aimed at improving the kingdomÕs image in Washington. Obama made sure to praise the prince's plan to transform the Saudi economy, dubbed Vision 2030. He also tried to reassure the Saudi royal that the U.S. will back the Saudis against interference by Iran, which remains an official enemy of the United States.  But some constants in the U.S.-Saudi relationship have turned into variables, meaning that even after Obama leaves office in just a few months, the alliance could prove rocky.  160922_ted_cruz_gty_1160.jpg 2016 Cruz feeling the squeeze on Trump endorsement By BURGESS EVERETT The low price of oil, for example, is forcing the kingdom to rethink its economy; the U.S. also relies more now on its own energy reserves, reducing AmericaÕs addiction to Saudi oil. Some observers also point to cultural changes in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia Ñ women, though still facing severe segregation, make up a growing share of the workforce; young people are more exposed than ever to the Internet and the outside world; and thousands of Saudis educated in the U.S. are now capitalizing on that experience in their country.  By all accounts, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia still maintain a strong security relationship, and U.S. officials privately say the Saudis are helpful partners in the fight against terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, which the Saudi monarchy views as a threat to its own rule. U.S. officials also say the Saudis have taken steps in recent years to silence the most radical of their Islamist preachers and change their school curricula to be more tolerant.  ""The close cooperation on countering violent extremists like [the Islamic State], the continued Saudi preference for American arms, the important role that Saudi Arabia plays in international energy markets and the $70 billion dollars worth of annual trade between the two countries are enough to sustain this relationship for the foreseeable future,"" said Fahad Nazer, a former political analyst with the Saudi Embassy in Washington who now does similar work for JTG Inc.  In many ways, what Obama thinks about the Saudis matters less and less as his time in the Oval Office draws to an end. But while the Saudis will be happy to see him leave, there's great uncertainty in Riyadh about how the next president will deal with them.  Both Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have voiced grave concerns about Saudi Arabia's track record of producing Islamic extremists; Clinton has said she supports the 9/11 lawsuit bill. But while Clinton would likely be a more predictable partner, the Saudis see Trump Ñ who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States Ñ as a wild card.  For now, however, the Saudis are nervously watching Congress to see exactly how unhappy lawmakers are with them.  Already, some members of Congress are hinting that they are not comfortable with the 9/11 legislation after all, and that they may consider voting to uphold Obama's veto. Their hesitation comes as a growing number of foreign countries and blocs, including the European Union, voice opposition to the bill. The original bill passed on voice vote in both Houses, making a veto override especially sensitive because members will have to go on the record. And with the presidential election looming, the politics are even more fraught than normal.

But Trump hasnÕt quite done that.  Instead, the Republican presidential nominee delivered a more muted response as he called into Fox News Thursday morning, saying Òthere's a lack of spirit between the white and the black.Ó A day earlier, while campaigning in a black neighborhood in Cleveland, Trump defended an unarmed black man who was shot recently Ñ and questioned the actions of the police officer who shot him.  After more than a year of running one of the most racially and ethnically divisive campaigns in decades, Trump has begun to zig and zag on issues of race in the electionÕs final stretch.  Appearing with black supporters and in black neighborhoods multiple times this month, Trump has sought to wash away the charges of racism that white nationalists have cheered. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has made casting Trump as outside-the-mainstream Ñ she hammered Trump on The Steve Harvey Show for Òbullying and bigotryÓ this week Ñ one of the cornerstones of her campaign.  TrumpÕs advisers and the candidate himself insist his concerted black outreach is a genuine effort to chip away at DemocratsÕ overwhelmingly margin among black voters, a group with whom he is polling in the low single digits. But Democrats, and even some skeptical Republicans, see his new tone more as an effort to make himself palatable to uneasy white voters who might otherwise be turned off by his past rhetoric.  ÒWhen he asks black voters, ÔWhat have you got to lose, it canÕt get any worse,Õ heÕs really just cynically talking to white voters,Ó said Rob Stutzman, a veteran Republican strategist and Trump critic.  NAACP President Cornell William Brooks said, ÒI can't discern the intentions of Mr. Trump on this issue, but here's what we can say: Policy without particulars on the eve of the election insults the intelligence and sensitivities of any group.Ó  Reps. John Lewis (D-Ga.), Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Cedric Richmond (D-La.), along with other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, hold a news conference after marching to the Department of Justice on Thursday. Black Caucus marches to DOJ to protest shootings By HEATHER CAYGLE and JOHN BRESNAHAN Trump spoke most at length about the unfolding violence in Charlotte on Thursday at an energy conference in Pittsburgh, describing a Òvery wounded countryÓ and national leadership vacuum that he would fill.  ÒThere is no right to engage in violent disruption,Ó Trump said, as Charlotte residents have taken to the streets in violent protest of the fatal shooting of a black man there. Police have fired back tear gas in intense clashes.  He pitched his Òlaw and orderÓ approach as beneficial to black communities.  ÒThe people who will suffer most are law abiding African-American residents,Ó Trump said.  That line was in his prepared remarks distributed by his campaign. But moments later, he ad-libbed a white stereotype of black communities. ÒAnd if youÕre not aware,Ó Trump said, deviating from his teleprompter. ÒDrugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night.Ó  These days, Trump regularly tells mostly white audiences about the travesty of black neighborhoods, comparing them to war-torn places like Afghanistan. In rural North Carolina on Tuesday, Trump said that African-American communities are Òabsolutely in the worst shape that theyÕve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.Ó  On Wednesday, not long after his appearance with a Cleveland church where Trump questioned the police officer in Oklahoma who shot an unarmed black man, Terence Crutcher, Trump embraced a broad expansion Òstop-and-frisk,Ó a controversial policing policy. By Thursday, Trump said he wasnÕt backing a national policy Ñ saying he was only referring to Chicago, despite making his comment in Cleveland.  ""We've seen an expression of empathy for the loss of Mr. Crutcher's life, followed by a call for the nationalization and expansion of stop-and-frisk, preceded by a call for law and order without specifying what that means,Ó Brooks said. ÒHis platform suffers from a multiple personality disorder. It's not consistent.Ó  Still, Trump has clearly made some efforts. In Pittsburgh, Trump preached empathy. ÒWe all have to walk a mile in someone elseÕs shoes,Ó he said.  It was an echo of none other than ClintonÕs remarks after the shooting of police officers in Dallas in July.  ÒI will call for white people like myself to put ourselves in the shoes of those African-American families,Ó Clinton said on CNN then.  Pat Toomey is pictured. | AP Photo CONGRESS GOP senators succumb to TrumpÕs war on trade By SEUNG MIN KIM With all his stop-and-start black outreach, Trump appears to be honing the greatest of political skills: letting different audiences hear the same words and imbue them with different meaning.  ÒIt just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. I mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing. You're seeing it, I'm seeing it. And you look at what went on last night in Charlotte, a great place, and you just see it,Ó as he said Fox News on Thursday. ÒThere's a Ñ there's somewhat Ñ and I see it even going out. There's such a lack of Ñ there's a lack of spirit. There's a lack of something. Something's going on that's bad. And what's going on between police and others is getting worse.Ó  The ÒracistÓ charge has deeply irked TrumpÕs friends and allies.  Bruce LeVell, the executive director of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump who traveled with him in Ohio this week, expressed frustration with the negative labels affixed to Trump.  ÒItÕs just unfair, unfortunately, what heÕs had to endure,Ó LeVell said. ÒI donÕt believe heÕs changed his tone and tenor. Donald Trump has been clear since day one heÕs for all Americans.Ó  Trump has drawn historically low support levels in polling among African-American voters, including some swing-state surveys over the summer in Ohio and Pennsylvania that showed him with 0 percent. He has climbed from such lows, claiming his numbers are trending upward Òlike a rocket shipÓ but he remains mired in single digits in most surveys.  His approval among Latinos is not much better. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News, showed Trump with 17 percent support among likely Hispanic voters Ñ 10 points below what Mitt Romney received four years ago. Nearly 80 percent had negative feelings about Trump.  Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster who has said Republicans must do better among minority groups to compete in national elections, said he couldnÕt be sure who TrumpÕs spate of black outreach was truly targeting.  ÒYour question assumes a level of calculation that I am not sure is warranted,Ó Ayres said.
